Here's quite a bit of text to make sure it occupies at least one line. And
after this text follows a quote (*without no gap between*):
" This *is* ~the~
  first quote. It
  contains some ~bold text~, and also
  some *italic text*.

  Then, a new paragraph with a bit of text as well, just enough
  to make another line wrap.
  -
  With that said, the quote ~ends~. "

Paragraph
with some
words

another paragraph
"
  some quote 
"
Text following the quote directly (~witout gap!~).

A little poem
"
  The moon rose in the east, the rose was red,
  the moon was blue, that's what I read.
" [Anonymous, 2016]

Yet anonther paragraph.
