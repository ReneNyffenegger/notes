{ Python

  With → development/languages/Python, a simple webserver can be started in the document root like so:
code {
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777
code }
  7777 is obviously the port number.

  Alternatively, a webserver can also be started with
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo python -m http.server 80
code }
Note: the port is optional. The `sudo` is apparently required for ports below 1024(?).
