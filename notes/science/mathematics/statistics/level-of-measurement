$ Statistics: level of measurement

If it cannot be ordered (for example: yellow, red, green, brown, white), it's ~nominal scale~.

*Otherwise*, if it can be ordered, but addition is impossible (for example: terrible, bad, neutral, good, excellent), it's ~ordinal scale~.
-
The ability to order the items allows to compare these with one another (1st, 2nd, 3rd …)

*Otherwise*, if addition is possible, but multiplication does not make sense, it's ~interval scale~ (30° C ≠ 2*15° C, but 30° C + 15° C = 45° C).
-
Other examples of interval scales are *timestamps* (but not necessariy *time durations*), IQ(?), location in Cartesian space, cardinal direction (degrees from North).

*Otherwise*, if multiplication is possible (has a zero point, for example person's weight), it's ~ratio scale~.
-
What about discrete values (such as *number of children*)?

→ science/mathematics/statistics/variables[Variables] that are measured on the *ordinal, interval or ratio* scale are ~quantitative variables~ while → science/mathematics/statistics/variables[variables] that are measured on the
*nominal* scale are ~qualitiative variables~ (aka categorical variables).
