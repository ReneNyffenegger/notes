Least squares is used → science/mathematics/statistics/model/regression-analysis to approximate the solution of *overdetermined systems* (more equations than unknowns).

The algorithms are typically applied to *data fitting* problems

Two categories
  • ordinary least squares (has a closed-form solution)
  • nonlinear least squares (usually solved by iterative refinement)



Note:
  The terms *linear regression* and *least squares* are closely linked; but they're not synonyms.
