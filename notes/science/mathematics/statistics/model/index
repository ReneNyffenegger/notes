A statistical model is a *formal representation of a theory* that embodies a set of *statistical assumptions*. It is typically expressed as a mathematically function
( → science/mathematics/probability/distributions[probability functions]) that relates *random variables*.
-
Thus, it is a *non-deterministic* mathematical model.

  • Statistical estimators

{ Variables

  { Types of variable

    A variable is either
      • continouos
      • discrete or
      • categorical (qualitative).

    Categorical variables come in three types:
      • Binary (mutually distinct: male or female)
      • Practical
      • Ordinal

    Categorical variables (for example hair color or gender) don't have a natural order.

    The number of children in a household is a discrete variable: there cannot be 2.3 children.

    Continouos variables come in two types:
      • Ratio (Needs to have a 0-point, such as *height*)
      • Interval (Temperature is an interval variable, because 2° is not twice as hot as 1°)

{ Over- and underfitted models #over-and-underfitted-models

  An *overfitted model* contains more *parameters* than can be justified by the data.

  An *underfitted model* cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data, for example when fitting a linear model to non-linear data.

  Over- and underfitting typically occur in → development/Data/science/Machine-learning (where it is called *over-* and *undertraining*) and
  → science/mathematics/statistics/model/regression-analysis.

  Techniques to reduce overfitting:
    • model comparison
    • cross-validation
    • regularization
    • early stopping
    • pruning
    • Bayesian priors
    • dropout

{ TODO

  → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/neural-networks[Neural networks] are *non-linear* models.
