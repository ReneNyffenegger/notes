Statistics: Collecting data, analysing it and drawing conclusion from it.


{ Descriptive vs inferential statistics

  Statistcs is divided into inferential and descriptive statistcis.

  Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes data with numbers. It doesn't make predictions
  on these data. Typical descriptive numbers are:
    • mean age
    • highest income
    • number of buyers of a product

}
{ Random sampling vs stratified sampling

  Random sampling does not ensure that the composition of the sample matches the composition of the population.

}

{ Variable

  { Continouos and categorical variables

    A variable is either continouos, discrete or categorical (qualitative).

    Categorical variables (for example hair color or gender) don't have a natural order.

    The number of children in a household is a discrete variable: there cannot be 2.3 children.

  { Explanitory variable

    aka: predictor variable

    German: erklärende/unabhängige/prädiktor/eoxogene Variable

    Goes on x-axis (abscissa)

  }
  { Response variable

    German: interessierende/endogene Variable - Zielvariable

    Goes on y-Axis (ordinate)

  }

}
{ Statistical methods

  All explanatory variables continouos:   Regression
  -
  All explanatory variables categorical:  Analysis of variance (Anova)
  -
  All explanatory variables both:         Analysis of Covariance (Ancova)

  Response variable:
    • continouos: normal regression, anova or ancova
    • proportion: logistic regression
    • count: Log linear models
    • Binary: Binary logistic analysis
    • Time-at-death: Survival analysis

}
{ Regression Analysis

  Regression analysis is used to describe the relationship between:
  a response variable Y and one or more predictor variables X₁ ... Xش (n=1: simple regression,
  n>1: multivariate regression)

  Y must be a continuous variable, Xしcan be continuous, discrete or categorical.

}
{ Sampling

  " The test of the random sample is this: Does every name or thing
    in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample?
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 22 ]


  "  … how do you get a random sample within the stratification?
    The obvious thing is to start with a list of everybody and go
    after name chosen from it at random; but that is too expensive.
    So you go into the streets ­ and bias your sample against
    stay-at-homes. You go from door to door by day ­ and miss most
    of the employed people. You switch to evening interviews ­ and
    neglect the movie-goers and night-clubbers.
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 23 ]

}
{ Bias

  "  Suppose you were to send to a group … a questionnaire that included
     this query: »Do you like to answer questionnaires?«
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 14]

  " … bias introduced by unknown factors. It seems likely that the most
    effective factor was a tendency that must always be allowed for in
    reading polls result, a *deisre to give a pleasing answer*.
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 27 ]

}
{ Model #model

  A model describes the relationship between variables. Thus, it is the basis to make predictions.

  The most basic model is the *simple linear regression*:
  -
  Y=β₀ + β₁X + ε
  -
  ε is the error term

  A generalization of the simple linear regression is the *multiple linear regression*:
  -
  Y=β₀ + β₁U + Β₂V + β₃W + ε

  U, V and W are the predictors, Y the response.

  A model is useful if there is an approximate linear relationship between the predictors and the response.

  In → development/languages/R, a linear model is built with → development/languages/R/functions/lm[`lm`] (which returns a model object).
