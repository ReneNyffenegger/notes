An important ~goal~ of statistics is to investigate *casuality*.
-
Two major types of causal studies:
  • experimental studies
  • observational studies

In order to reach this goal, → development/Data[data] is
  • collected,
  • analyzed,
  • interpreted,
  • presented and
  • organizid
so that conclusions can be drawn from it.


{ Statistical tests and procedures

  • ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
  • Chi-squared test
  • Correlation
  • Factor analysis
  • Mann-Whitney U
  • MSWD (Mean squared weighted deviatioN)
  • Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
  • → science/mathematics/statistics/model/regression-analysis
  • Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
  • Students t-test
  • Time series analysis
  • Conjoint analysis

{ Descriptive vs inferential statistics #descriptive-vs-inferential-statistics

  Two main methods for statistics:
    • Descriptive statistics: summarize data using indexes (mean, standard deviation etc.)
    • Inferential statiistics: draw conclusions from data

  Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes data with numbers. It doesn't make predictions
  on these data. Typical descriptive numbers are:
    • mean age
    • highest income
    • number of buyers of a product

  *Statistical inference* uses → development/Data/analysis[data analysis] to decude properties of its underlying → science/mathematics/probability/distributions[probablity distribution].

? Inferential statistics is important for *statistical hypothesis testing* and

{ Random sampling vs stratified sampling

  Random sampling does not ensure that the composition of the sample matches the composition of the population.

}

{ Statistical methods


  All explanatory variables continouos:   Regression
  -
  All explanatory variables categorical:  Analysis of variance (Anova)
  -
  All explanatory variables both:         Analysis of Covariance (Ancova)

  Response variable:
    • continouos: normal regression, anova or ancova
    • proportion: logistic regression
    • count: Log linear models
    • Binary: Binary logistic analysis
    • Time-at-death: Survival analysis

}
{ Regression Analysis

  → science/mathematics/statistics/model/regression-analysis/index is used to describe the relationship between:
  a response variable Y and one or more predictor variables X₁ ... Xش (n=1: simple regression,
  n>1: multivariate regression)

  Y must be a continuous variable, X can be continuous, discrete or categorical.

}
{ Sampling

  " The test of the random sample is this: Does every name or thing
    in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample?
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 22 ]


  "  … how do you get a random sample within the stratification?
    The obvious thing is to start with a list of everybody and go
    after name chosen from it at random; but that is too expensive.
    So you go into the streets ­ and bias your sample against
    stay-at-homes. You go from door to door by day ­ and miss most
    of the employed people. You switch to evening interviews ­ and
    neglect the movie-goers and night-clubbers.
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 23 ]

}
{ Bias

  "  Suppose you were to send to a group … a questionnaire that included
     this query: »Do you like to answer questionnaires?«
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 14]

  " … bias introduced by unknown factors. It seems likely that the most
    effective factor was a tendency that must always be allowed for in
    reading polls result, a *deisre to give a pleasing answer*.
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 27 ]

}
{ Model #model

  A → science/mathematics/statistics/model[model] describes the relationship between variables. Thus, it is the basis to make predictions.

  The most basic model is the *simple linear regression*:
  -
  Y=β₀ + β₁X + ε
  -
  ε is the error term

  A generalization of the simple linear regression is the *multiple linear regression*:
  -
  Y=β₀ + β₁U + Β₂V + β₃W + ε

  U, V and W are the predictors, Y the response.

  A model is useful if there is an approximate linear relationship between the predictors and the response.

  In → development/languages/R, a linear model is built with → development/languages/R/functions/lm[`lm`] (which returns a model object).

}
{ Test of relationship

  • Propose a relationship between two datasets
  • Compare with → science/mathematics/statistics/null-hypothesis[null-hypothesis] (no relationship between two datasets)

  Types of errors
    • Type I: null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a *false positive*
    • Type II: null hypothesis is falsely accepted giving a *false negative*

}
{ Software

  • → development/languages/R
  • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming[SAS]
  • Mathematica
  • SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences)

  { Econometrics

    *Econometrics* applies statistical methods to *economic data*.

    The basic tool for econometrics is the *multiple linear regression*.
