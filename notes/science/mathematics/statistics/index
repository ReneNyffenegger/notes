Statistics: Collecting data, analysing it and drawing conclusion from it.

{ Variable

  A variable is either continouos or categorical.

  { Explanitory variable

    aka: predictor variable

    German: erklärende/unabhängige/prädiktor/eoxogene Variable

    Goes on x-axis (abscissa)

  }
  { Resonse variable

    German: interessierende/endogene Variable - Zielvariable

    Goes on y-Axis (ordinate)

  }

}
{ Statistical methods

  All explanatory variables continouos:   Regression
  -
  All explanatory variables categorical:  Analysis of variance (Anova)
  -
  All explanatory variables both:         Analysis of Covariance (Ancova)

  Response variable:
    • continouos: normal regression, anova or ancova
    • proportion: logistic regression
    • count: Log linear models
    • Binary: Binary logistic analysis
    • Time-at-death: Survival analysis

}
Regression Analysis {

  Regression analysis is used to describe the relationship between:
  a response variable Y and one or more predictor variables X₁ ... Xش (n=1: simple regression,
  n>1: multivariate regression)

  Y must be a continuous variable, Xしcan be continuous, discrete or categorical.

{ Sampling

  " The test of the random sample is this: Does every name or thing
    in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample?
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 22 ]


  "  … how do you get a random sample within the stratification?
    The obvious thing is to start with a list of everybody and go
    after name chosen from it at random; but that is too expensive.
    So you go into the streets ­ and bias your sample against
    stay-at-homes. You go from door to door by day ­ and miss most
    of the employed people. You switch to evening interviews ­ and
    neglect the movie-goers and night-clubbers.

{ Bias

  "  Suppose you were to send to a group … a questionnaire that included
     this query: »Do you like to answer questionnaires?«
  " [ → science/mathematics/statistics/sources/1954-Huff_How-to-Lie-with-Statistics, p. 14]

  " … bias introduced by unknown factors. It seems likely that the most
    effective factor was a tendency that must always be allowed for in
    reading polls result, a *deisre to give a pleasing answer*.
