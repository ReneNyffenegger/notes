{ Histogram #histogram

   A histogram must not be confused with →#bar-chart[bar charts]: the histogram is for continuous data while the
   bar chart is for categorical values.

   The number of *classes* in a histogramm might be determined with ~Sturgi's rule~: use `1 + log₂(N)`, rounded to the
   nearest integer, classes.
