{ Bar chart #bar-chart

  Also known as *frequency table*?

  A bar chart must not be confused with a →#histogram[histogram].

  In order to display *many categories*, a horizontal bar chart should be used because of the space needed by the labels.

{ Histogram #histogram

   A histogram is a graphical representation of a science/mathematics/probability/distributions[distribution]. The
   → science/mathematics/statistics/variables[variable] is partitioned on the x-axis into contiguous *class intervals* (bin widhts), usually of equal widths.

   The number of *classes* in a histogramm might be determined with ~Sturgi's rule~: use `1 + log₂(N)`, rounded to the
   nearest integer, classes.
   -
   The ~Rice rule~ calculates the number of classs as twice the cube root of observations.

   The heights of the bars represent the *class frequencies*.

   A histogram must not be confused with →#bar-chart[bar charts]: the histogram is for continuous data while the
   bar chart is for categorical values.

{ Pie chart

  Pie charts are not well suited to graph many categories, rather horizontal → #bar-chart[bar charts] should be used.
