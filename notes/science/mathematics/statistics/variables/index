$ Statistics: variables

A *variable* measures an attribute (such as height, temparature, etc.) and assigns the measured state to a *value*.
All measured values belong to a *variable* and an *observation*. An *observation* contains
all values that were measured on the same object (such as student, item produced etc.)

The → development/languages/R[R] community calls a → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data set]
→ development/languages/R/packages/tidyr#tidyr-tidy-data[tidy] if each variable is stored in a column, each observation is stored in a row
and each type of observational unit forms a table (Hadley Wickham).
-
This structure somewhat corresponds to Codd's 3rd normal form.

Categorization:
  • Discrete vs continuous variables
  • Qualitative vs quantitative variables

Discrete variables can only take on a finite number of values.
-
All qualitative variables are discrete.
