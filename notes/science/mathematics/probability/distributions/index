{ Terminology

  • Mode: the value with highest probability for discrete variables, a location at which the probability density function has a local peak for continuous variables
  • Support: the smallest closed set whose complement has probability zero.
  • Head:  the range of values where the pmf or pdf is (relatively) high. *Tail* is the head's complement within the support.
  • Mean: The *weighted average* of possible values. The weights are the values' probabilities. Aka: *expected value*.
  • Variance: The second moment of the pmf or pdf about the mean. It measures the *dispersion* of the distribution.
  • Standard deviation: the second moment of the pmf or pdf about the mean. Another measure of *dispersion*.
  • Symmetry: a property of some distributions in which the portion of the distribution to the left of a specific value is a mirror image of the portion to its right.
  • Skewness:  a measure of the extent to which a pmf or pdf "leans" to one side of its mean.
  • Kurtosis: a measure of the "fatness" of the tails of a pmf or pdf. The fourth standardized moment of the distribution.
  • Median
