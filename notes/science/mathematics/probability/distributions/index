  { Chi-squared 

     The chi-square distribution is a special case of the → #gamma-distribution[gamma distribution].

     It is a widely used distributions in
     → science/mathematics/statistics/index#descriptive-vs-inferential-statistics[inferential statistics], primarily in *hypothesis testing* or in construction of *confidence intervals* because 
     of its (mathematical) relationship to the → #distribution-normal[normal distribution].

{ Terminology

  • Mode: the value with highest probability for discrete variables, a location at which the probability density function has a local peak for continuous variables
  • Frequency: The number of times a certain variable apperas
  • Support: the smallest closed set whose complement has probability zero.
  • Head:  the range of values where the pmf or pdf is (relatively) high. *Tail* is the head's complement within the support.
  • Mean: The *weighted average* of possible values. The weights are the values' probabilities. Aka: *expected value*.
  • Range: The difference between the lowest and highest value.
  • Variance: The second moment of the pmf or pdf about the mean. It measures the *dispersion* of the distribution.
  • Standard deviation (σ): the second moment of the pmf or pdf about the mean. Another measure of *dispersion*. The standard deviation measures how *close* the data is centered around the *mean*.
  • Symmetry: a property of some distributions in which the portion of the distribution to the left of a specific value is a mirror image of the portion to its right.
  • Skewness:  a measure of the extent to which a pmf or pdf "leans" to one side of its mean.
  • Kurtosis: a measure of the "fatness" of the tails of a pmf or pdf. The fourth standardized moment of the distribution.
  • Median: Half of data points below, other half above.

}
{ Cumulative distribution function (CDF)

  Cumulative distribution function, aka cumulative densitiy function is the probability that a random variable, evaluated at x, is less than or equal to x.
