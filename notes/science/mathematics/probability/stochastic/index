*Stochastic* describes something that was randomly determined

{ Stochastic processes

  A stochastic or random process is a *collection of random variables* that is indexed by some mathematical set (the *index set*).
  - 
  Thus, each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set.

  A *sample function* (aka *realization*) is one outcome that the process generated.

  • Bernoulli process
  • Wiener process (Brownian motion)
  • random walks
  • maringales
  • Markov processes: next value depends on current value but is independent of previous values (for example: Brownian motion)
  • Lévy processes
  • Gaussian processes
  • random fields
  • renewal processes
  • branching processes
