    Novation is the transfer of the rights and obligations of one party in a contract to a new party who steps into the contract.

    The three involved parties are called: *transferor*, *transferee* and *remaining party*.b
                                                                                             
  }                                                                                          
  { Value at Risk (VaR)                                                                     d

    The VaR measures the probability of a certain loss over a given time period.
    
    Common stated probabilities are 1 and 5 %, common time periods are a day and two weeks.

    For example, a one-day 5% VaR of $1 million means that there is a 5% chance to loose $1 million within a day.
