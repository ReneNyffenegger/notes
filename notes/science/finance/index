  { Value at Risk (VaR) 

    The VaR measures the probability of a certain loss over a given time period.
    
    Common stated probabilities are 1 and 5 %, common time periods are a day and two weeks.

    For example, a one-day 5% VaR of $1 million means that there is a 5% chance to loose $1 million within a day.
