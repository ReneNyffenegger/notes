*Functional programming* is a → science/computer/Programming-paradigm[programming paradigm]. It is largely about applying functions to lists (of values).

The origin of functional programming is the *lambda calculus*.

Functional programming languages require to have → science/computer/Programming-paradigm/Functional-programming/First-class-function[first class functions].

*Pure functions* (or expressions) have no side effects.

  { Lambda Calculus

    Lambda Calculus only has
      • function definitions and
      • function calls

    It notably doesn't have if statements, types, variables, loops and recursion.
    -
    Even though, it can compute anything that a classic language like C can.

    `e` is one of
    table { ll
      `x` ☰ Variable (which is any letter of the alphabet)
      `λx.e` ☰ Abstraction (i. e. a nameless function where `x` is the argument and `e` is the function's body). The `λ` and the `.` always come together in pairs.
      `e₁ e₂` ☰ Application. `e₁` is r evaluates to a function to which `e₂` is applied.
    table }

   `e₁ e₂ e₃` is the same as `(e₁ e₂) e₃`.

   `λx.x` is an aabstraction that represents the *identity function*.

   `λy.λx.x` is a an abstration that ignores its first argument and returns the identify function.

    { Currying

      An abstraction (function) can only have one argument (i. e. one letter between the `λ` and the `.`).
      -
      In order to create a function that takes two arguments, two functions must be defined:
        • A function that takes the first arguumet which creates
	• the function that takes the second argumet

code {
λx. λy. ‥ x ‥ y ‥
code }

      In pseudo code, this is sometimes abbreviated with `λxy. ‥ `

    }
    { Loop

      A loop can be expressed in lambda calculus like so (a function that is applied to itself):
code {
(λx.x x) (λx.x x)
code }

       Because when the function on the right side is applied to the function on the left side, the result is again
code {
(λx.x x) (λx.x x)
code }

?     Allegedly, this formallows to define a loop in a language that doesn't have loops.

    }
    { Y-Combinator

      Is this the Y-Combinator?
code {
λf.(λx.f(x x)) (λx.f(x x))
code }

?     Allegedly, the Y-Combinator allows to define a recursion in a language that doesn't have recursions.

    }
