First class functions have the ability to receive functions as arguments or to return functions. Thus, they are related to the mathematical concept of *higher-order functions*.

A → science/computer/Programming-paradigm/Functional-programming[Functional programming languages] require to have first class functions.

A simple example of a first class function is → science/computer/Programming-paradigm/Functional-programming/First-class-function/map[map].

{ Misc

  An example of a *higher order function* from the realm of calculus is the *differential operator* (d/dx) which returns the derivative (a function) from a given function.
