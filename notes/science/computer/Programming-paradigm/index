An attempt to classifiy → development/languages[programming languages] based on their features give raise to the term *programming paradigm*.
-
Two commonly refered to paradigms are
  • imperative languages, and
  • declarative languages
However, if this distinction make sense is another question altogether.

{ Imperative languages

  In a *imperative language*, the programmer's task is to exactly specifiy who a machine gets to the desired outcome.

  Imperative languages are further divided into
    • procedural and
    • object-oriented languages

}
{ Declarative languages #declarative-languages

  In a declarative language, the programmer's task is to specify the desired outcome. The computer will then find a way to get to this outcome.

  Arguably, the most successful declarative language is → development/databases/SQL[SQL].
  -
  Another well-known example of a declarative programing language is XSLT.
