*Robotic process automation* (RPA) aims at replacing repetetive tasks that are performed by humans with a machine (which can be a software).

{ Similarities to GUI testing

  RPA is similar to graphical user interface testing tools because they also repetitively automate interactions with a GUI.

  However, the goal of testing tools is to find errors while the goal of RPA is to eliminate errors.

  RPA is also different from such testing tools that in many cases, an automated robotic process operates on more than one system.
