$ Programs and scripts that show command line arguments

Every once in a while, I need to know what arguments are passed to a program or a script. In order not to always create such scripts and programs from scratch, I continue to put these
programs and scripts here.

{ prog.c

 `prog.c` is the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C] version:
  gh|show-command-line-arguments|/prog.c||

}
{ script.ps1

 `scipt.ps1` is the → Windows/PowerShell version:
  gh|show-command-line-arguments|/script.ps1||

}
{ proc.cs

 `prog.cs` is the → development/languages/C-Sharp variant:
  gh|show-command-line-arguments|/prog.cs||

}


sa:

  The Github repository for these scripts is → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/show-command-line-arguments[here].

  Showing command line arguments when executing
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/parse-command-line/bat[a batch file] and
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/parse-command-line/exe[an exe].
