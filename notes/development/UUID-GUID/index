UUID = Universally Unique IDentifier, aka GUID (= Globally Unique IDentifier).

A UUID is 128 bits long and guarantees to be unique in space *and* time without the need to be centrally registered.


{ Reprentation

  `llllllll-mmmm-Mhhh-Nsss-nnnnnnnnnnnn`.
  
   Each letter encodes 4 bits.

   `l` - time low: the low 32 bits of the time.

   `m` - time mid: the middle 16 bits of the time.

   `h` - time high: the high 12 bits of the time

   `s` - (plus 1 to 3 bits of `N`): Clock sequence
  
   `M` - indicates UUID version, the one to three most significant bits of `N` the UUD variant.

   `n` - the 48 bits of the node.

   { Microsoft Windows

     Apparently, → Microsoft chose to represent GUIDs with curly braces: `{llllllll-mmmm-Mhhh-Nsss-nnnnnnnnnnnn}`, for example in the → Windows/registry[registry].

     Also, the apparently used → development/endianness[mixed endianness] : the first three parts are little-endian and the last two parts are little-endian.
     The byte array `00`, `11`, `22`, … `ff` would be represented as: `33221100-5544-7766-8899-aabbccddeeff` 

     Windows uses GUIDs heavily in the realm of → Windows/development/COM[COM], for example to identify COM obects (in which case the GUID is called *CLSID*).

     See also the include file → Windows/development/WinAPI/data-types#winapi-datatype-guiddef_h[`<guiddef.h>`].

{ GUIDs as primary keys

  Because each GUID is distinct from each other, they lend themselves to be used as → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/primary-key[primary keys] in → development/databases[databases].

  In → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle], a GUID can be created with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/sys_guid[`sys_guid`].

  Methods to create a GUID in → development/databases/SQL-Server are:
   • `newid()` returns a version 4 UUID 
   • `newsequentialid()` returns 128 identfier that is sequentially ascending up to the next reboot
   •  16-bit GUIDs can be stored in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/uniqueidentifier[`uniqueidentifier` data type]

}
{ Creation of GUIDs

  The → Windows/development/WinAPI[Windows API] provides a few functions to create GUIDs:
    • `UuidCreateSequential`
    • `UuidCreate`
    • `CoCreateGuid`

}
