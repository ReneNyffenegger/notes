$ Language model

A *language model* is a probability distribution over sequences of words, that is, a propability is assigned to any sequence of m words.
-
Because there are infinitely many valid sentences (→ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_infinity[digital infinity]), it is impossible(?, or at least difficult) to assign a non-zero propability
to valid sentences that are not present in the training data.

Several approaches try to tackle this problem:
