$ Large Language Models (LLMs)

{ Classification based on the Transformer architecture

  Transformer based LLMs can be clasified into the three variations:
    • Encoder only
    • Decoder only
    • Encoder-Decoder

}
{ Perplexity

  The most basic intrinsic measure of a language model's performance is its *perplexity* on a given text corpus:
  It measures how well a model is able to predict the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity.

  Perplexity is related to the *cross-entropy* loss function which is used to train neural language model. 

}
{ Allocating training budget

  When training an LLM, the available budget (compute) must be allocated to
    • number of model parameters
    • number of training tokens

  Some guidance about such an allocation can be gained by applying the → https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361[Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models].

}


{ TODO

  ? Context size/length: the number of tokens taken into account to predict the next token.

  { Models

    A list of models is maintained by → https://lifearchitect.ai/models-table/[LifeArchitect.ai].

  { Cerebras-GPT

   *Cerebras-GPT* is a family of seven GPT models ranging from 111 million to 13 billion parameters.
   
    These models were trained on *CS-2* systems (Andromeda AI supercomputer) using the *Chinchilla formula*.
    -
    Their weights and checkpoints are available on Hugging Face and GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.

  }
  { GPT-4

    GPT-4 was released without any information about its model architecture, training data, training hardware or hyperparameters.

    As per → https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai[The secret history of Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and OpenAI], GPT-4 has 1 trillion parameters.

  }
  { Chinchilla (DeepMind)

    Same budget as Gopher but with 70 B parameters and 4 times more data.

    Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3
    (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range
    of downstream evaluation tasks. It uses substantially less computing for
    fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage.

  { Benchmarks

    { BIG-Bench

      BIG-Bench is a collaborative benchmark with over 150 tasks which aim at producing challenging tasks for LLMs.

      The tasks include
        • logical reasoning,
        • translation,
        • question answering,
        • mathematics, and
        • others
