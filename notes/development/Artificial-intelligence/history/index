  Theory: Nets without circles:
    • The activity of the neuron is an “all-or-none” process.
    • A certain fixed number of synapses must be excited within the period of latent addition in order to excite a neuron at any time, and this number is independent of previous activity and position on the neuron.
    • The only significant delay within the nervous sytem is synaptic delay.
    • The activity of any inhibitory synapse absolutely prevents excitation of the neuron at that time.
    • The structure of the net does not change with time.
