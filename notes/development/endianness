In ~little endian~, a number  is laid out in memory with the least significant byte first. Thus `0x12345678` is stored like so: `0x78 | 0x56 | 0x34 | 0x12`.

In ~big endian~, the number is stored with the order of bytes reversed.

*Big endian* is also referred to as *network byte order*.

→ hardware/CPUs/Intel[Intel CPUs] are *little endian*.

sa:
  In an Oracle database, the endianness of a database can be determined by → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join[joining]
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database#v_database-platform_id[`v$database` to `v$transportable_platform`].
