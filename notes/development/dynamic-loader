The dynamic loader finds and loads shared libraries needed by a program when the program is run.
By default these libraries are in → Linux/fhs/lib and → Linux/fhs/usr/lib. The file → Linux/fhs/etc/ld_so_conf can be used
to specifiy additional search paths.

Determine the name of the dynamic loader with `readelf -l executable | grep interpreter`, for example
`readelf -l $(which ls) | grep interpreter`.

The dynamic loader must not be confused with the → Linux/shell/commands/ld[standard-linker] (`ld`).

sa:
  → development/dynamic-linker
