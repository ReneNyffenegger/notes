$ Data life cycle

{ Typical life cycle of data

  A typical life cycle of data might be:

  ~Active data~: After the data is inserted in the database, it is active data: it is frequently queried and updated.

  ~Queried often~: The data is not changed anymore, but still queried often (for example for reports).
  
  ~Dormant~: After a while, the data becomes dormant, it is neither updated nor queried anymore. It is still kept in a database, however,
  for compliance and regulatory purposes.
