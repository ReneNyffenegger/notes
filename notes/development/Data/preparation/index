$ Data preparation

Data preparation is crucial to turn *raw data* into value.

Often, data preparation is more time-consuming than working with the prepared data.

  Typical challanges include:
    • Finding all relevant → development/Data sources
    • When data sources are found: connecting to them
    • Data needs to be reshaped when data sources are finally connected to
    • Automate data reshaping process, because typically the reshaping of data is not a one-off.
    • Large time sets whose processing time delays → development/Data/quality[quality] testing
    

  One of the major challenges that data prepartion addresses is the *heterogeneity* of → development/Data[data] in most but very small organizations: Data is stored in various *data formats* in different data stores
 (→ development/databases[databases], → Microsoft/Office/Excel, → Companies-Products/SAS, etc.) and needs to be merged into a format that is useful for further processing.

  In order to merge the data, the same entities (such as for example a customer) that are stored accross different databases must be able to be identified as such. In an ideal world, there would be a → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/primary-key[primary key]. However,
  because data is stored in different formats for different purposes, it turns out that usually there is not *one* primary key, rather, the same entities are identitifed differently in different data sources, especially when
 *surrogate keys* are used.

  Antother challenge I often observe are outliers, that is: data with unusual or (seemingly) unrealistic values. It is often not evident when a value is in fact an outlier or if unrealist values can be explained with more domain knowledge.

  Yet another challenge are → development/databases/SQL/data-types/null[null values] because they can be → development/databases/SQL/data-types/null#sql-null-interpretation[interpreted in at least two ways]: *unknown* and *none*.

{ Privacy violation

  → development/Data preparation might uncover confidential or private information or to expose data that identifies a specific person.

  Therefore, data should be anonymized (aka de-identified) before or during data preparation.
