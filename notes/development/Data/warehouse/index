$ Data warehouse (DWH)

A *data warehouse* is a relational database that stores data in a way that it can be easily and performantly queried and → development/Data/analysis[analyzed].

According to *Bill Inmon*, regarded by many as the father of Data warehouses, a data warehouse is defined as
"
  a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and
  non-volatile collection of data to enable the decision-making process
" [ Inmon, *Building the Data Warehouse*, Wiley, 3rd ed. 2002 ]

A typical DWH environment includes
  • → development/Data/warehouse/ETL (or other applications that gather → development/Data[data].
  • An → development/Data/OLAP engine
  • Client analysis tools
  • Applications that distribute the data to users

{ Relationship to data-mining

  *Data-warehousing*: For → development/Data/mining to take place, data from many sources (billing records, phone call records, orders etc) must be gathered together
  and organized in a consistent and useful way. Data warehousing allows the enterprise to remember what it has noticed about its customers.
  -
  A data warehouse can track customer behaviour over time and becomes the memory of a company. So, it makes it possible for data miners and scientist to find trends.

{ Relation to data marts #datawarehouse-vs-datamart

  A → development/Data/mart[data mart] is a subset of a data warehouse which is optimized towards a specific subject (usually with organizational character
  such as finance, marketing or sales).

  The conjunction of all data marts therefore equals more or less the data warehouse.

{ Data warehouse challenges

  With all the benefits of data ware houses, I believe two challanges need to be kept in mind when implementing data warehouse:
    • A data warehouse stores redundant data
    • → development/Data/quality

  { Redundant data #dwh-redundant-data

    Datawarehouses store a second copy of corporate data.

    So, there needs to be a mechanism to keep the copy in sync with the operational data store.

    There are some prodcuts, such as → Companies-Products/IBM/IDAA, that try to solve this problem.
    -
    More recently, a buzzword to overcome this problem is → development/Data/virtualization.

  { Data quality vs Business agility

    Running a data warehouse forces its operators to trade → development/Data/quality[data quality] off against → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_agility[business agility].

{ Misc

  An ~EDWH~ is an *Enterprise* Datawarehose.

  Data warehouses are often a source of → development/Data/ for → Business/intelligence.

  A → development/Data/lake[data lake] stores data in its native format and thus stands in contrast to a data warehouse.
