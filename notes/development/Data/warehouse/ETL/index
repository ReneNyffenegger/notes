ETL stands for *Extract, Transform and Load*.

{ Common Issues

  Some issues with ETL processes include:
    • It's often expensive to keep them up to date with new versions (or even products) of source or target systems
    • → development/Data[Data] is not actual. An IDC study (3rd Platform Information Management Requirements Survey, IDC, 2016) reports that 80% of data that is delivered by ETL processes is between 2 and 7 days old
    • Security: because the data is copied, additional effort needs to be taken to ensure that only the authorized people can access the data.
    • Compliance: because of the security concerns, compliance regulations such as the GDPR needs to be taken into account
    • Storage: it also needs to be taken into account that the copied data requires more storage to be present.

  { Data virtualization

    Because of these issues, it is proposed to use → development/Data/virtualization rather than traditional ETL processes.

    With data virtualization, data, on its different sources and with its different formats, is not replicated, rather it is accessed from a single point, usually referred to as *data hub*,  using a standardized method.

  ? The → development/databases/SQL-Server feature that promises data virtualization is → development/databases/SQL-Server/features/PolyBase.
