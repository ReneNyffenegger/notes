$ Using SPARQL and R and to plot the open data coordinates of fountains onto a shape file

This is an attempt to use the → development/languages/R/packages/SPARQL[R SPARQL package] to query the approx. 1200 fountains of Zurich from
→ development/Data/open/Wikidata and to plot their coordinates onto the Open data → development/data-formats/Shape-file[shape file] provided
by the City of Zurich.

The SPARQ query was inspired by → https://dinacon.ch/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/10/Linked-Data-Experience.pdf[DINAcon: Linked Data Experience].

The coordinates that the query returns are then plotted. → development/languages/R/functions/identify[`identify()`] is used so that the
user can click onto a fountain on the map. The selected fountain will then be shown in the Wikidata resource in the user's default browser.
