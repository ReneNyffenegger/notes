{ Data model

  Wikidata has *subjects* on which *structured data* is stored. These subjects are called ~entities~.

  Every entity is associated with a *page*.

  There are two types of entitites:
    • item (whose identifier starts with `Q`)
    • property (whose identifiers start with `P`)

  The entities and properties form a *directed graph* in which the entities are the nodes and the properties are the edges.
  -
  The model is different from → development/web/RDF[RDF] in that the graphs's edges (i.e. the properties) can be annotated. Such annotations
  record the the source of the information, the temporal validity etc.

  { Item

    An *item page* consists of (at least?) these main parts
      • *label*
      • *description*
      • list of *aliases*
      • list of *statements*
      • list of *site links*
    Label, description and aliases are also known by *terms*. These are used to find and display items.

  }
  { Property

    Properties have *terms* but no statements or site links.

    A property has a *data type* that constrains the accepted range of values.

  }
  { Statements

    A statement can be enriched with a *qualifier* which provides additional context information for the claim.
    -
    Qualifiers are expressed as properies.
    -
    Examples for qualifiers are *start date* (P580) or *end date* (P582).

    A statement can include one or more *references* which support the claim.
    -
    A reference is property-value pair (or a list of property-value pairs?)

  }
  { None and some

    A property can have the value *none* or *some*.

    *none* indicates that it is known that the given property was not available for the entity.

    *some* indicates what it is known that the given property was available, but we don't know its value.
