{ Challenges with CSV and JSON #data-exchange-challenges

  CSV and JSON are noteably quite prone to → development/Data/corruption, mainly because these format have almost no notion for data types or domains (such as date and/or time).
  So, it's easy to insert a text such as *hello world* into a field that is supposed to store a date.

  { Scalability, parallel processing

    CSV and JSON cannot (easily) be split into partitions that can be processed in parallel.
