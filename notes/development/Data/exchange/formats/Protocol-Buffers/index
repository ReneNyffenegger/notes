{ protoc #protoc

 `protoc` is the *protocol buffer compiler*: it compiles `.proto` files.

  { Installation

    Apt based systems;
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler
code }

    A → development/languages/Python wrapper(?) can apparently be installed with
code {
sudo apt-get install python-protobuf
code }

    On ~Windows~, `protoc.exe` can be downloaded somewhere from → https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases[here].

  }
  { Building from sources
    Alternatively, protocol buffers might be built directlly from the sources:
code {
python setup.py build
python setup.py test
python setup.py install
code }

 }

}
{ .proto files

 `.proto` files contain service and message definitions.
