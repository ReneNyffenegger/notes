CSV is probably the most common → development/Data/exchange/formats[import and export format] for → development/Data[data] of spreadsheets and → development/databases[databases].

{ Reasons to use semicolons rather than commas

  Although the C in CSV stands for comma, there are good reasons to use semicolons to delimit fields one from another.

  One reason is that there are many countries where a comma is already used as a decimal seperator.

  Also, semicolons make more sense to be used as separators because they are less likely to occur in ordinary text than commas.
