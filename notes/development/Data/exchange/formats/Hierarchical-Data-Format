The *Hierarchical Data Format* (at least HDF5) is useful to store huge amounts of numerical data and easily manipulate it with → development/languages/Python/libraries/numpy[NumPy].

Two versions:
  • HDF4
  • HDF5

A HDF5 file is a container that stores
  • datasets (think tables or → development/languages/Python/libraries/numpy arrays), and
  • groups (which store groups and datasets, hence the *hierarchical* data format)
