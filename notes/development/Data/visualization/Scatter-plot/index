@ Scatter plot

German: *Streudiagram*

A scatter plot displays two variables of a set of data using cartesian coordinates.

An example of a scatter plot might be the → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/Hertzsprung-Russell-Diagram[Hertzsprung Russel Diagram].

{ Overplotting

  Overplotting occurs when points of the scatter plot fall on the same same spots. Thus, points are hidden which makes it difficut, at times even impossible,
  to see where the points lie.

  In order to prevent overplotting, *jittering* the points might be advisable.
