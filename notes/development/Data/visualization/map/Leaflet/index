*Leaflet* is the leading open-source → development/languages/JavaScript/index library for mobile-friendly interactive → development/Data/visualization/map[maps].

{ Misc

  At least in `setView()`, the coordinates order is latitude, longitude (the opposite of the order used in → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/GeoJSON).
  -
  However, when using the R-library `leaflet`, the order is the same as in GeoJSON!
