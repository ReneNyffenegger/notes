{ App: gpstest

  → https://github.com/barbeau/gpstest[gpstest] is an *open-source global navigation satellite system (GNSS) testing app* that helps with troubleshoot GPS data.

  The app helps determine
    • which GNSS satellite networks a phone supports (Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS, GPS, QZSS, etc.)
    • the satellites it can see and is using at any given time,
    • which frequencies your device listens on (whether it supports dual band signals, for example)
    • the accuracy of the data the phone reports
