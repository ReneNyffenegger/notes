{ Choropleth map

  A *choropleth map* shades or pattern areas in a map in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed in the respective area.

}
{ Tile servers

  The *zoom level* determines the number of tiles required to map the entire World. The formula is `4 ^ $zoomLevel` (for example zoom level 0 has one tile, zoom level has 64 tiles etc.)

  Tiles are 256x256 pixels (→ https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox_GL[Mapbox GL]: 512x512 pixels).
