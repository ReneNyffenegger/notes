$ Data Vault modelling

{ Hub tables #hub-tables

  A hub table represents a *master data entity*.

  Such a table has a
    • Surrogate key
    • Business key (which usually is the primary key from the data source system)
    • *No* business attributes

  Hubs are colored *blue*.

}

{ Satellite tables #satellite-tables

  All business attributes are stored in satellite tables.

  A foreign key in the satellite table references the primary key (surrogate key?) in the hub table.
  --
  A hub table is referenced by one or more hub tables.
  - 
  Sometimes, when there are attributes that are thought not to change over time, they
  are stored in a different satellite table than data that is thought to change over time.
  -
  Additionally, data from different source system could be stored in different satellite tables.

  A satellite table has a `valid_from` (or effective date), but not a `valid_to` (or expiration date). Thus,
  the dreaded(?) *updates* can be reduced (or omitted?)

  Satellite tables are colored *red*.

}

{ Links #links

  Relationships are modelled as links, which in fact are *many to many* relationships between hub tables.
  -
  With the *many to many* approach, it is hoped to be more flexible (really …?).

  Link tables are colored *green*.
