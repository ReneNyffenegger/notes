{ Method to store versions of master data

  { Head tables

    A head table represents a *master data entity*.

    Such a table has a
      • Surrogate key
      • Business key (usually the primary key in the data source system)
      • Static data that (supposedly) doesn't change (really?).
      • Possibly further »SCD1« attributes.

    In a → development/Data/warehousing/modelling/Data-vault[data vault model], head tables can be
    compared to → development/Data/warehousing/modelling/Data-vault#hut-tables[hub tables].

  }
  { Version tables

    Business attributes that might change are stored in version tables.

    The version table references the head table (foreign key to the head table's surrogate key?)

    A `valid_from` and a `valid_to` column declares the time range in which the data in the record was actually valid.

    In a → development/Data/warehousing/modelling/Data-vault[data vault model], version tables can be
    compared to → development/Data/warehousing/modelling/Data-vault#satellite-tables[satellite tables].

  }
  { Foreign keys

    Generally (allegedly: always), foreign keys point to primary keys in *head tables*. Thus, it is independent of the (changing) values in version tables.

  }
