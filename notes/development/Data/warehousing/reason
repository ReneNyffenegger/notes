$ Reasons for data warehouses


Two important reasons for data warehouses are
  • to save time when creating a new report
  • to aggregate, slice and dice data in more sophisticated ways.

One version of the truth.

Save resources on production database systems: since the data is copied from the source database systems and queried in the data warehouse, this
relieves stress on the production database system and gives them better performance.j

The value of data can be augmented with data from various sources in the organization. 

The data is stored in a common format on a single databaes which makes it easier for data users to access them.

Data can be historized and archived (for example for regulatory reasons). Reports can be dynamically re-created for any dates, thus
reports need not be archived.

The physical data model can be Optimized for
  • read access and
  • sequential disk scans.

Table and column names can be given more meaningful names than in the source system.

Changing (or upgrading) *one* source system does (should...) not affect end users.

BI solutions can be created more easily.
