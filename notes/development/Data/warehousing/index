{ Relationship to data-mining

  *Data-warehousing*: For → development/Data/mining to take place, data from many sources (billing records, phone call records, orders etc) must be gathered together
  and organized in a consistent and useful way. Data warehousing allows the enterprise to remember what it has noticed about its customers.
  -
  A data warehouse can track customer behaviour over time and becomes the memory of a company. So, it makes it possible for data miners and scientist to find trends.

{ Relation to data marts #datawarehouse-vs-datamart

  A → development/Data/mart[data mart] is a subset of a data warehouse which is optimized towards a specific subject (usually with organizational character
  such as finance, marketing or sales).

  The conjunction of all data marts therefore equals more or less the data warehouse.

}
{ Issues #data-warehouse-issues

  Datawarehouses store a second copy of corporate data.

  So, there needs to be a mechanism to keep the copy in sync with the operational data store.

  Apparently, → Companies-Products/IBM/IDAA tries to solve this problem.
