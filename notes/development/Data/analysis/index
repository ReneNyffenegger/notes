{ Three parts of data analysis

  Data analysis consists of three parts:
    • Extraction: collect the data from various sources
    • Transformation: → development/Data/cleaning[cleaning] and consolidating the data
    • Visualization: → development/Data/visualization[graphing the data].

  T. Dasu and T. Johnson wrote 2003:
  "
    In our experience, the tasks of exploratory data mining and data cleaning constitute 80% of the effort that determines 80% of the value of the ultimate data
    mining results. 
  " [ Exploratory Data Mining and Data Cleaning ]

{ Data exploration

  Data exploration is similar to an initial data analysis. However, the data analyst uses *visual exploration* to understand the characteristics of a dataset.

  Steps:
    • Ask questions to the data.
    • Find answers to questions with visualization, transformation and data-modelling.
    • Refine questions and ask new questions based on answers.

  Some of the arguably(!) best data exploration tools on the market seem to be → Companies-Products/Tableau and *Looker*.
