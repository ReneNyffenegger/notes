$ OLAP dimension

Dimensions are used to categorize data.

Typical dimensions (for example for a sales → development/Data/OLAP/cube[cube]) are
  • time
  • customer
  • product
  • channel
A value (for example: revenue) can then be placed into dimensions and is identified by them.

Dimensions are often identified by a *fact* table's *foreign keys*.

The dimensions form the edges of a → development/Data/OLAP/cube[cube].
