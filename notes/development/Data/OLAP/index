OLAP stands for *Online Analytical Processing*.

OLAP databases are designed and optimized for querying data, typically for reporting purposes.

An OLAP database is usually fed with data from an → development/Data/OLTP database. The data is then organized and aggregated in (multidimensional) cubes rather than tables which allows
to analyse the data fast.

There are two fundamental types of data in an OLAP database: *measures* and *dimensions*.

The term *OLAP* was created in j1993 by Edgar F. Codd.

Better performance might be achieved if the → development/Data is stored in → development/databases/architecture/row-column-based[column format].
