*Anomaly detection*, aka *outlier detection*: identification of items, events and/or observations that do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a *dataset*.

Anomaly detection might be used in
  • Intrusion detection
  • Fraud detection
  • Fault detection
  • System health monitoring
  • Preprocessing a data set before → development/Data/preparation[data preparation]



{ Techniques

    • Density-based (k-nearest neighbor, local outlier factor …)
    • Subspace- and correlation-based (high-dimensional data)
    • One-class support vector machines.
    • Replicator neural networks
    • Bayesian Networks.
    • Hidden Markov models (HMMs).
    • → development/Data/mining/Clustering[Cluster analysis]
    • Deviations from association rules and frequent itemsets.
    • Fuzzy logic

  These techniques are applied 
    • Unsupervised,
    • Supervised or
    • Semi-supervised
