$ Anomaly detection
@ anomaly detaction

*Anomaly detection*, aka *outlier detection*: identification of items, events and/or observations that do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a *dataset*.

Anomaly detection might be used in
  • Intrusion detection
  • Fraud detection
  • Fault detection
  • System health monitoring
  • Preprocessing a data set before → development/Data/preparation[data preparation]



{ Techniques

    • Density-based (k-nearest neighbor, local outlier factor …)
    • Subspace- and correlation-based (high-dimensional data)
    • One-class support vector machines.
    • Replicator → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/neural-networks[neural networks]
    • Bayesian Networks.
    • Hidden Markov models (HMMs).
    • → development/Data/mining/Clustering[Cluster analysis]
    • Deviations from association rules and frequent itemsets.
    • Fuzzy logic

  These techniques are applied 
    • Unsupervised,
    • Supervised or
    • Semi-supervised

{ Outlier detection to test data quality #outlier-detection

  *Outlier data* can be views as »totally different« from the rest of the data. Hakwins (*Outlier detection  using  replicator  neural  networks*, 2002) defined it more formally as
"
  An outlier is an observation which deviates  so  much  from  the  other
  observations  as to  arouse  suspicions  that  it  was  generated  by  a
  different mechanism.
"

  With such a »definition«, the observation of outlier data might be used to asses → development/Data/quality[data quality].
