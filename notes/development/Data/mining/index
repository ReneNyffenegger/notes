$ Data-mining

Data mining applies → science/mathematics/statistics[statistics] and *pattern recognizion* to large amounts of → development/Data[data] from the past
to discover (potentially) interesting information and knowledge for future actions.

Problem: seperate signal from noise.

The data mining process is also known as *knowledge discovery*. It is not enough, just to find interesting,
previously unknown, patterns in the data, the process must also show what a company has to *do*.

Data mining bridges the gap between → development/Artificial-intelligence[artificial intelligence] and → development/databases[databases].

Techniques and tasks
  • → development/Data/mining/anomaly-detection[Anomaly (or outlier) detection] (outliers, change and deviation detection)
  • Associate rule learning: try to find relationships between variables
  • → development/Data/mining/Classification and prediction
  • → development/Data/mining/Clustering (Discover groups and structers in the data)
  • → development/Data/mining/Affinity-grouping/[Affinity grouping/association rules]
  • Sequence analysis
  • Regression: try to find a function that models the data with the least error.
  • Time series analysis
  • Text mining
  • Summarization

New techniques:
  • Sociel network analysis
  • → development/Artificial-intelligence/sentiment-analysis[Sentiment analysis] (aka opinion mining or emotion → development/Artificial-intelligence[AI])


A datamining process can be broken into six major phases (cf → development/Data/mining/Cross-industry-standard-process-for-data-mining)

{ Directed vs undirected

  Directed data mining: try to explain or categorize a target value (temperature, income etc).
  -
  Used techniques: → development/Data/mining/Classification,
  → development/Data/mining/Estimation and Prediction.

  Undirected data mining: try to find patterns or similarities without targeting a specific value.
  -
  Used techniques: → development/Data/mining/Affinity-grouping and → development/Data/mining/Clustering.

  → development/Data/mining/Profiling is used for both directed and undirected data mining.

}
{ Dangers

  Finding patterns doesn't mean there an underlying rule for it (Big dipper in the sky)

}
{ Model set

  The (historical) data used to develop data mining models.

  Beware of *biased* samples (customers vs prospects, responders vs non-responders).

}
{ TODO

  Does *political correctness* consideration thwart the opportunities of data mining?
