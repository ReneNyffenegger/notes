$ Data-mining

Data mining: discover (potentially) interesting information for future actions from large amounts of data from the past.

Problem: seperate signal from noise.

The data mining process is also known as *knowledge discovery*. It is not enough, just to find interesting patterns in the
data, the process must also show what a company has to *do*.

Techniques:
  • → development/Data/mining/Classification and prediction
  • → development/Data/mining/Clustering
  • Outlier detection
  • → development/Data/mining/Affinity-grouping/[Affinity grouping/association rules]
  • Sequence analysis
  • Time series analysis
  • Text mining

New techniques:
  • Sociel network analysis
  • Sentiment analysis


A datamining process can be broken into six major phases (cf CRISP-DM [Cross Industry Standard process for data Mining])
  • Business understanding
  • Data understanding
  • Data preparation
  • Modeling
  • Evaluation
  • Deployment

{ Directed vs undirected

  Directed data mining: try to explain or categorize a target value (temperature, income etc).
  -
  Used techniques: → development/Data/mining/Classification,
  → development/Data/mining/Estimation and Prediction.

  Undirected data mining: try to find patterns or similarities without targeting a specific value.
  -
  Used techniques: → development/Data/mining/Affinity-grouping and → development/Data/mining/Clustering.

  → development/Data/mining/Profiling is used for both directed and undirected data mining.

{ Dangers

  Finding patterns doesn't mean there an underlying rule for it (Big dipper in the sky)

}
{ Model set

  The (historical) data used to develop data mining models.

  Beware of *biased* samples (customers vs prospects, responders vs non-responders).

}
{ TODO

  Does *political correctness* thwart the opportunities of data mining?
