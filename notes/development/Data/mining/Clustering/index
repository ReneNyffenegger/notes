Clustering tries to discover groups (»segments«, »clusters«) of similar items from a large heterogenous set of items. These clusters are then *homogenous* rather than heterogenous.

Clustering is different from → development/Data/mining/Classification/[classification] in that it has not a  predefined set of classes.
