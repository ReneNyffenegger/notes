Clustering tries to create a *taxonomy* by discovering groups (»segments«, »clusters«) of similar items from a large heterogenous set of items. These clusters are then *homogenous* rather than heterogenous.

Clustering is different from → development/Data/mining/Classification/[classification] in that it has not a predefined set of classes.

Types of clustering
  • Hierarchical
  • Partitional (Clusters might contain subclusters)
  • Overlapping (a data point might belong to mutliple clusters), aka non-exclusive
  • Fuzzy (A data point belongs to a cluster with weight between 0 and 1)
  • Partial (Not every data point has to belong to a cluster), the opposite being: complete clustering

Algorithms:
  • k-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that finds k clusters in a data set
