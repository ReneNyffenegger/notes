$ data virtualization

The goal of *data virtualization* is to process → development/Data that is stored in heterogenous sources and and is spread over multiple locations without copying the data first (and potentially having to write it back).

In order to reach this goal, the data is not replicated, rather it stays in its original location and is accessed from a single point, usually referred to as *data hub*, using a standardized method.
