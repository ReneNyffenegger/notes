$ Data modeling

{ Traditional modeling techniques / structured data

  The traditional modelling techniques as outlined by *Kimball* and *Inmon* are focussed on modelling → development/Data/structured.

  { Kimball / dimensional modeling

    Kimball's approach is also known as *dimensional modeling* 

    The key components of Kimballs' dimension modelling are *fact* and *dimensional tables*.

    A *fact table* stores numerical values (such as *sales revenue* etc.). In → development/databases/SQL, these values are typically aggregated 
    with → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by/aggregate-functions[aggregate functions].

    A *dimensional table* store the entities on which the numerical values are aggregated with the → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] SQL statement.

?   A fact table has → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/foreign-key[foreign keys] that reference the corresponding
    → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/primary-key[primary keys] of the dimension tables.

    There are three types of dimensional modeling:
      • Star model (which is really a special -denormalized- case of the snowflake model)
      • Snowflake model (where a star model's dimensions are normalized into mulitple related tables)
      • Multi-star model

    Because the snowflake model is normalized, it tends to require less space, but requires ETL processes to make sure
    that data is adequatly loaded.

    The goal of the star model compared to the snowflake model is to make queries faster and joining tables easier.

    { Two layererd data load process

      Kimball proposes a two layered data load process consisting of
        • Staging area
        • → development/Data/warehouse[Data warehouse] area

    }

  }
rem {
  { Inmon

    Inmon’s approach is also known as *Entity Relationship Model* (ER) or *Third Normal Form (3NF)*.

    { Three layered data flow process

      In addition to the two layers of Kimball, Inmon proposes an additional

  { Challenges
   
    According to a study by Gartner Group in 2011, 80% of then data's is unstructured *An Advanced Unstructured Data Repository*, X. Liu, B. Lang et al

    The rise of unstructured and semi-structured data (text documents, images, video, IoT etc.) along with the increase of stored *data volume* in general, these
    traditional modelling techniques face growing pressure.

{ Models for unstructured data

  Models that are able to deal with unstructured data include
    • → development/Data/lake[Data lakes]
    • … ?
