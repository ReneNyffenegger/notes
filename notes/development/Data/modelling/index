$ Data modeling

{ Traditional modeling techniques / structured data

  The traditional modelling techiniques as outlined by *Kimball* and *Inmon* are focussed on modelling *structured data*.

  { Kimball / dimensional modeling

    Kimball's approach is also known as *dimensional modeling* 

    The key components of Kimballs' dimension modelling are *fact* and *dimensional tables*.

    A *fact table* stores numerical values (such as *sales revenue* etc.). In → development/databases/SQL, these values are typically aggregated 
    with → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by/aggregate-functions[aggregate functions].

    A *dimensional table* store the entities on which the numerical values are aggregated with the → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] SQL statement.

    A fact table has → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/foreign-key[foreign keys] that reference the corresponding
    → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/primary-key[primary keys] of the fact tables.

    There are three types of dimensional modeling:
      • Star model
      • Snowflake model
      • Multi-star model

    { Two layererd data load process

      Kimball proposes a two layered data load process consisting of
        • Staging area
        • → development/Data/warehouse[Data warehouse] area

    }

  }
  { Inmon

    Inmon’s approach is also known as *Entity Relationship Model* (ER) or *Third Normal Form (3NF)*.

    { Three layered data flow process

      In addition to the two layers of Kimball, Inmon proposes an additional

  { Challenges
   
    According to a study by Gartner Group in 2011, 80% of then data's is unstructured *An Advanced Unstructured Data Repository*, X. Liu, B. Lang et al

    The rise of unstructured and semi-structured data (text documents, images, video, IoT etc.) along with the increase of stored *data volume* in general, these
    traditional modelling techniques face growing pressure.
