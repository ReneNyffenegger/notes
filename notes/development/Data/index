  Visualize data with → science/mathematics/statistics/descriptive/graphics[statistical graphics]. 

  In order to get a value from data, it needs to be moved from one location to another.

  The four W:
    • What is this data: Data dictionary
    • Where is my data: Data catalog  
    • Where did it come from: Data lineage
    • Who knows about the data: Data Stewardship

  Regulations that require *data hygiene*, such as
    • → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCBS_239[BCBS 239] (Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting)
    • → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation[GDPR] (General Data Protection Regulation)
