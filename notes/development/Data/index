{ Definition of data

  → misc/ISO/14721[ISO 14721] defines data as 
  "
    A reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing. Examples of data include
    a sequence of bits, a table of numbers, the characters on a page, the recording of sounds made by a person speaking, or a moon rock specimen.

{ Two types of data

  Two (three) types of data (a)
    • data that describes things: *master data*
    • data that describes events: *transactional data*
    • Some authors (Vayghan et al 2007) also add *historical data* to the list.


  Two types of data (b)
    • Qualitative data
    • Quantitative data
  (See also → science/mathematics/statistics/level-of-measurement[level of measurement])

{ Structured and unstructured data #un_structured-data

  Data might also be divided into
    • Structured data (Relational databases etc.)
    • Semi-structured data (i.e. → design/graphic/pdf[PDF], → development/XML[XML])
    • Unstructered data (like raw video and audio)

  Because of the complexity of unstructured data, → development/Data/profiling[Data profiling] tools usually focus on structured and semi-structured data.

{ Challenges with increasing data volumes

  The ever incresing volume of collected data causes challanged, such as
    • Age of data: old data might not represent the a factual truth
    • Storage Cost: the cost to store data increases. Contrary to popular opninion, storage prices don't get cheaper. Especially SANs are sometimes prohibitively expensive and are easily the most costly factor in a data center.
    • Complexity: Managing lots of data is complicated and puts even more pressure on its cost
    • Data sprawl: The size of data is increased also because it is copied between organizations, divisions, test, integration and prod systems etc.

{ TODO

  → http://nongnu.org/txr/txr-manpage.html[TXR] for *data munging*.

  Visualize data with → science/mathematics/statistics/descriptive/graphics[statistical graphics]. 

  In order to get a value from data, it needs to be moved from one location to another.

  The four W:
    • What is this data: Data dictionary
    • Where is my data: Data catalog  
    • Where did it come from: Data lineage
    • Who knows about the data: Data Stewardship

  Regulations that require *data hygiene*, such as
    • → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCBS_239[BCBS 239] (Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting)
    • → development/Data/privacy/GDPR[GDPR] (General Data Protection Regulation)
