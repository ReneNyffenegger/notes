• RBLM: Rule based machine learning

{ Learning paradigms

  There are three major learning paradigms:
    • Supervised learning
    • Unsupervised learning
    • Reinforcement learning

  { Supervised vs non-supervised learning
  
    In supervised learning algorithmes, a → science/mathematics/statistics/model#statistic-model-dependent-variable[dependent variable] is assigned the role of a *target variable*.
    - 
    Then, known values are provided for the target variable.
  
  }

}
{ Cost function

  The cost function estimates how bad (or wrong) the performance of a → science/mathematics/statistics/model[model] is.

  The *goal* of machine learning is to minimize the cost function.

{ Automatic summarization #machine-learning-automatic-summarization

  *Automatic summarization* tries to determine the semantic meaning of a text.

  Approaches:
    • Extraction: select a subset of words, phrases or sentences
    • Abstraction: build an internal semantic representation

  Automatic summarization is used, for examples, in → web/Search-Engines[search engines].

{ Misc

  The terms machine learning, → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/pattern-recognition,  → development/Data/mining[data mining] and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) overlap in scope. Thus, they are hard to separate.

  Over- and undertraining: → science/mathematics/statistics/model#over-and-underfitted-models. Overfitting usually happens when training was performed too long.
