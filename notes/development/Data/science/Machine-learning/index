{ Supervised vs non-supervised learning

  In supervised learning algorithmes, a → science/mathematics/statistics/model#statistic-model-dependent-variable[dependent variable] is assigned the role of a *target variable*.
  - 
  Then, known values are provided for the target variable.

{ Misc

  The terms machine learning, → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/pattern-recognition,  → development/Data/mining[data mining] and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) overlap in scope. Thus, they are hard to separate.

  Over- and undertraining: → science/mathematics/statistics/model#over-and-underfitted-models. Overfitting usually happens when training was performed too long.
