{ Matrix operations

"
  When you start to peel away the layers of a machine learning model, you’ll
  find it’s just a bunch of matrix multiplications under the hood. Whether the
  input data to your model is images, text, categorical, or numerical it’ll all
  be converted into matrices.

  The basic matrix multiplication seems to be `i*w+b=p` (`i`=inputs, `w`=weights, `b`=bias, `p`=prediction).

  Free form text might be converted into matrices with the *Bag-of-words* model.

{ Learning paradigms

  There are three major learning paradigms:
    • Supervised learning
    • Unsupervised learning
    • Reinforcement learning

  { Supervised vs non-supervised learning
  
    In supervised learning algorithmes, a → science/mathematics/statistics/model#statistic-model-dependent-variable[dependent variable] is assigned the role of a *target variable*.
    - 
    Then, known values are provided for the target variable.
  
  }

}
{ Cost function

  The cost function estimates how bad (or wrong) the performance of a → science/mathematics/statistics/model[model] is.

  The *goal* of machine learning is to minimize the cost function.

{ Automatic summarization #machine-learning-automatic-summarization

  *Automatic summarization* tries to determine the semantic meaning of a text.

  Approaches:
    • Extraction: select a subset of words, phrases or sentences
    • Abstraction: build an internal semantic representation

  Automatic summarization is used, for examples, in → web/Search-Engines[search engines].

{ Misc

  The terms machine learning, → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/pattern-recognition,  → development/Data/mining[data mining] and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) overlap in scope.
  Thus, they are hard to separate.

  RBLM = *Rule based machine learning*

  Over- and undertraining: → science/mathematics/statistics/model#over-and-underfitted-models. Overfitting usually happens when training was performed too long.
