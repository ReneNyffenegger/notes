$ Download the MNIST data set with Python

In → development/languages/Python, the → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/data-sets/MNIST data set can be downloaded, for example, from `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/TensorFlow/Keras/datasets[tensforflow.keras.datasets].mnist`:
code {
import tensorflow as tf

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
code }

The data (`x_train` etc.) is returned as `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/numpy/ndarray` objects.
