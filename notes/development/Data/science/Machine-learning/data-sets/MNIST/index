MNIST is a data set used typically used for «hello world» examples of machine learning.
-
The data set consists of (70000? = 60000 training + 10000 test? samples) gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits (0 … 9). The size of the images is 28 pixel by 28 pixels, the value of a pixel an integer between 0 and 255(?).
