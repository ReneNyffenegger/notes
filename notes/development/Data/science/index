$ Data science
-

Data science hopes to convert development/Data[data] intoknowledge and insights.

Data sciences combines
  • scientific methods
  • → science/mathematics/statistics (some equate statistics with data science!)
  • → development/Data/analysis
  • → development/Data/science/Machine-learning
  • → development/Data/mining/Classification[Classification and prediction]
  • → development/Data/mining/Clustering[Clustering]
  • uncertainity quantification
  • computional science
  • → development/Artificial-intelligence
  • → development/Data/mining
  • → development/databases[Database technologies]
  • → development/Data/visualization[Visualization]
  • processes
  • → development/algorithms
  • systems

{ Process

  • Collect data
  • Clean data
  • Exploratory → development/Data/analysis/[data analysis]
  • Create models and algorithms
  • Test algorithms
  • Make predictions
  • Communicate results (→ development/Data/visualization[visualization])
  • Repeat and improve

}
{ Skills

  A data scientist has the following skills:
    • Likes → development/Data[data], obviously. This includes preparing data (ETL etc.) and crunching numbers
    • Curious - so that he explores and researches new algorithms, techniques and paradigms
    • Is a good software developer - so that he can implement the algorithms in modern → development/languages[programming languages].
    • Understands → development/Software-design/Architecture[software architecture] - so that he can build sophisticated → development/Big-Data[big data] environments
    • Good communicator - so that he can explain and present the distilled result (insights) to stake holders.
