  ? KOGIS (= Koordination, Geo-Information und Services) is, along with → development/Data/exchange/formats/eCH, the custodian of INTERLIS language/specification.
  KOGIS coordinates some activities in the *Swiss Bundesverwaltung* related to Geoinformation (GI) and GIS 

  GML is an → development/XML grammar that allows to express *geographical features*. It is defined by the *Open Geospatial Consortium* (OGC).

  → https://thomas.skowron.eu/spaten/[Spaten] is a geo data format that purports to resolve issues that arise from using legacy serialization methods and simplify workflows.

  The → development/data-formats/Shape-file[ESRI shape file format] is the de facto standard for vector geodata.

  { WGS84

    WGS84 is the latest revision of the WGS (World Geodetic System) standard.

    WGS includes
      • Definitions of fundamental and derived constants of coordinate systems.
      • The Earth Gravity Model (EGM)
      • A description of the associated World Magnetic Model (WMM)
      • A current list of local datum transformations

    Definition 
      • The origin of the coordinate system is the Earth's center of mass (whose uncertainity is believed to be less than 2cm !)
      • The WGS84 meridian of zero longitude is the → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IERS_Reference_Meridian[IERS Reference Meridian], 102 meters or 5.3 arc seconds east of the Greenwich meridian.
      • The WGS 84 datum surface is an *oblate spheroid* with equatorial radius a = 6'378'137 m at the equator and flattening f = 1/298.257'223'563. 

    Apparently, it is planned to move to IGS20 on 27 November 2022 (not sure if this move has taken place).

  { H3

    → https://h3geo.org/[H3] is a *Hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system*.

    This system divides the surface of the Earth into 12 pentagons and n hexagons. The number of n depends on the resolution.

    The resolution varies from 0 (110 hexagones of approx 4,3 million km²) to 15 (Approx 569 hexagons of 0,895 m²), see → https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/[cell statistics].

    The github repository is → https://github.com/uber/h3[here].
