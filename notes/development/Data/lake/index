$ Data lake

According to *Dull*, a → development/Data[data] lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format, including structured, semi-structured and
unstructered data.
-
This implies that *any* and *all* data can be stored in a data lake.

The goal of data lakes is to be able to quickly load large volumes of data from changing data sources.

The data lake stores data until it is needed.

Because of the data's diversity and because it's stored in its native format, the concept of a data lake is in contrast to that of a
→ development/Data/warehouse[data warehouse].

The fact that a data lake does store all kinds of data formats, even unstructred ones, it is important to designe the data lake itself in structured fashion lest the
data lake does not become a data swamp.
