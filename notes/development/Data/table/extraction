$ Table extraction

*Table extraction* tries to infer a → development/Data/table[table's] structure from its presentation and then to convert the → development/Data to a structured form.

Because tables come in many different styles, formats and layouts, *automated* table extraction is a challenge.
-
With → development/Artificial-intelligence, better results *might* be achieved.


{ Subtasks

  Table exctraction (TE) comprises three *subtasks*:
  table { ll
    Table detection (TD) ☰ Locate the table in a document
    Table structure recognition (TSR) ☰ Find rows, columns and cells in the table.
    Functional analysis (FA) ☰ Determine the table data's keys and values.
  table }

}
{ ICDAR-2013 Dataset

  The *ICDAR-2013 dataset* was the first dataset to address the three *table extraction subtasks*.

  Because of its quality and relative completness comparared to other datasets, it is still popular for benchmarking (although
  it only consists of 257 tables for TD and TSR, and 92 tables for FA).
