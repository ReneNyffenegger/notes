$ Data cleaning

→ development/Data/quality[Data quality] might suffer because
  • it is merged from different (legcasy) source systems
  • user entry errors
  • operation errors (data is loaded twice, or forgotten to be loaded)
  • …

In order for the data to be useful, it needs to be purged from its problems.

{ Steps

  Data is cleaned in three steps:
    • Audit data to find discrepancies
    • Choose transformations that are appropriate to fix discrepancies
    • Apply transformations on data

  Discrepancies to look out for are
    • Outliers
    • Date formats
    • Missing values
    • Duplicates
    • …

}

{ Iteration

  Usually, data need to be cleaned in iterations: after resolving a particular data problem, it usually unhides problems that lie deeper.

{ Misc

   Lakshmanan, Sadri, and Subramanian proposed 1996 an extension to → development/databases/SQL[SQL] (→ https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SchemaSQL[SchemaSQL]) that
   allows to operate on messy datasets,

   Raman and Hellerstein provides a framework for cleaning datasets («Potter's Wheel») (2001)

   Kandel, Paepcke, Hellerstein and Heer developped an interactive tool with a friendly user interface which automatically creates code to clean data (2011).
