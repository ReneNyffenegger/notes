The Meson languages is *strongly typed* and *not turing complete*.

{ The humble beginning

  The following simple example was copy-pased from → https://mesonbuild.com/Tutorial.html. It compiles just *one* c source unit to produce an executable.

  { main.c

    The c source is:
    gh|about-meson|/The-humble-beginning/main.c||

  }
  { meson.build

    `meson.build` is the file which describes the relationships between
     source files and buildable objects.
  
     gh|about-meson|/The-humble-beginning/meson.build||

  }
  { Building

    In the directory where `meson.build` is located, the `meson` compiler(?) needs to be invoked:
code {
$ meson builddir
code }

   This command creates the directory `builddir` in which *ninja* is used to compile the project:
code {
$ cd builddir
$ ninja
$ ./demo
code }

  }

}
{ Nice features

  Meson seems to have a few nice features. The following `meson.build` script
  determines the version of the c compiler and issues a message if it is smaller
  than `7.0.0`:

  gh|about-meson|/nice-features/meson.build||

}
