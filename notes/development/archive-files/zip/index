$ zip file

A zip file stores the losslessly compressed data of one or more files, including their directory (path) information.

{ Compression methods

  The data in a zip file can be compressed in a variety of compression methods:
    • Store (no compression)
    • Shrink
    • Reduce (levels 1-4)
    • Implode
    • Deflate (the most commonly used compression method for zip files)
    • Deflate64
    • bzip2
    • LZMA (EFS)
    • WavPack
    • PPMd
    • PKWARE Data Compression Library (DCL) Implode (not documented)
    • IBM TERSE (not documented)
    • IBM LZ77 z Architecture (PFS) (not documented)

  The *deflate* algorithm is also used for gzip (→ development/web/RFC#rfc-1952[RFC 1952]) and → development/compression/zlib[ZLIB] (→ development/web/RFC#rfc-1950[RFC 1950]).

  and → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/archive/expand[`expand-archive`].

{ Info-ZIP

  *Info-ZIP* is an implementation of the zip file format that adds support for
    • → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[Unix file system] features such as → Linux/user[user] and → Linux/group[group] id
    • → Windows/file-system/NTFS filesystem permissions

  When extracting an info-zip file, that was created on Unix, on Windows, or vice versa, an attempt is made to translate NTFS permissions from/to Unix permissions. Apparently, this
  might lead to issues.

}
{ Magic number

  A zip file (and some other formats that are based on it) has as its first two bytes the letters *PK* (hex: `50` and `4B`) followed by `0304`, `0506` or `0708`.

  PK stands for the initials of the creator of the zip file format: Phil Katz.

}
{ Mime type

  The → development/web/Multipurpose-Internet-Mail-Extensions[MIME] type of a zip file is `application/zip`.
