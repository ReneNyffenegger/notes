Such an archive file is used for at least three purposes:
  • Distributing files
  • Backing up (archiving) files (hence the name)
  • Save disk space (for example → Linux/shell/commands/tar[tarred] files in combination with → Linux/shell/commands/gzip[`gzip`]).

sa:
   → Linux/shell/commands/zip[`zip`],
   → Linux/shell/commands/cpio[`cpio`]
