$ Monte-Carlo Methods

Monte-Carlo simulations use large amounts of random numbers (law of large numbers) to simulate an underlying problem. The simulation is
used to caluclate and obtain an (average) numerical results.
-
The development of *pseudorandom number generators* was thus spurred by Monte-Carlo Simulations.

Such simulations are often used to simulate financial systems that affect the value of instruments, portfolios or investements.

Steps
  • Definition domain of possible inputs
  • Generation of random inputs from a specific *probability distribution* over the domain.
  • Use deterministic formula to calculate output from random input.
  • Aggregation of resultDeterministic calculation of output from.
