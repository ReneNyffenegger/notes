{ Tail call

  If a function calls another function as the very last thing before it returns, that call is referred to as a *tail call*:
code {
func_A:
 # do stuff
   call func_B    # not a tail call
 # do more stuff
   call func_C    # tail call
   ret
code }

  { Tail call optimization (TCO)

    A tail call can be optimized by replacing the final `call ‥ ret` pair with a single `jmp`:
code {
func_A:
 # do stuff
   call func_B    # not a tail call
 # do more stuff
   jmp func_C
code}

    Not only does this optimzation need less instructions, but it also reduces the used stack size.

    helpful to me when I tried to understand TCO.
