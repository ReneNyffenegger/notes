A shape file actually consists of three files (compare → https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/28105/how-do-i-load-a-dbf-file-into-qgis[gis.stackexchange.com]:
  • `filename.shp`: the coordinates.
  • `filename.dbf`: a → development/databases/dBASE[dbase] file with information about a feature (for example road names).
  • `filename.shx`: links the .shp with the .dbf

The format was developped by → development/data-formats/ESRI.

Also seen were `filename.prj` files which indicate the data's projection.

{ QGIS

  In → tools/QGIS, a shape file is opened by usenig the *add vector layer* tool-button on the left side of the application.

}
{ R

  In → development/languages/R[R], the package → development/languages/R/packages/rgdal[rgdal's] function → development/languages/R/packages/rgdal#rgdal-readOGR[`readOGR()`] can be used to read shape files.

}
