CIM = *Common Information Model*.

CIM is an open standard that defines how managed elements in an IT environment (such as computers, network objects, …) are represented as a common set of objects and relationships between them.
-
The standard is maintained by → development/misc/DMTF[DMTF] (Distributed Management Task Force).

CIM uses an *object-oriented* approach: the managed elements are modelled using classes and instances.

→ Microsoft[Microsoft's] implementation of CIM is → Windows/Management-Instrumentation[WMI].

→ development/misc/WBEM[WBEM] is related to CIM.

A CIM class can be described in the *Managed Object Format* (MOF) language. Such a description is compiled with `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wbem/mofcomp_exe`.
