CIM = *Common Information Model*.

CIM is an open standard that defines how managed elements in an IT environment (such as computers, network objects, …) are represented as a common set of objects and relationships between them.

The standard is maintained by DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force).

CIM uses an *object-oriented* approach: the managed elements are modelled using classes and instances.
