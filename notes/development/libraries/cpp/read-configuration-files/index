$ Read configuration files with C++

*2020-09-24*: These classes were originally developed around 2004 and intended to be a lightweight → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus library to read ini-like config files. I seem to remember that at that time, I was able to use
them with Microsoft's → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[compiler (`cl`)]. I have never used them, though, productively. Recently, I received two mails that told me that these classes cannot be compiled. They are right: when trying
to compile them with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[GNU compiler], I get some errors like *error: ambiguous overload for 'operator=' (operand types are 'std::__cxx11::string {aka std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>}' and 'const Chameleon')* etc.

I have decided to nevertheless create a → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-read-configuration-files[github repository] for these classes. Maybe, someone still finds the idea useful or can improve the code so that it meets its
original expectation.

Unfortunately, I am unable to find one of the emails that were sent to me regarding this config file reader. In case you should read this, please forgive me, I would have liked to answer you.

This code was originally hosted on my «other» website → http://www.adp-gmbh.ch[adp-gmbh.ch]. On the original site, I had the following *thank you notes* for people than helped me improve the code at that time:

   A *chamaeleon* is a strange animal. Once it looks green, then it looks blue.
   Very strange indeed! Very much so with this class. It might look like a
   string, then again, it might look like a double.
