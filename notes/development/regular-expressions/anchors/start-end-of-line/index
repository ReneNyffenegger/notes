$ Regular expressions: start and end of line ($, ^)

`^` and `$` are *zero width* → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] anchor that match the beginning or end of the matched string.

With *multi line mode*, `^` also matches right after a → development/line-break[new line], `$` right before a new line.

{ PowerShell examples

  By default `$` matches at the end of a string, but not before a new line;
code {
PS C:\> "one`ntwo`nthree" → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/string-manipulation#ps-replace[-replace] '$', ' EOT'
one
two
three EOT
code }

  With multi line mode, `$` also matches before an end of line:
code {
PS C:\> "one`ntwo`nthree" -replace '(?m)$', ' EOL'
one EOL
two EOL
three EOL
code }

  It should be noted that the → Microsoft/dot-net regular expression engine only considers `\n` (0x0a) to be a new line, but not `\r\n` (`0x0d 0x0a0`).
code {
PS C:\> "foo`nbar" -match '(?m)o$'
True

PS C:\> "foo`r`nbar" -match '(?m)o$'
False
code }

}
