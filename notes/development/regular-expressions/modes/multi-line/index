$ Regular expressions: Multi line mode

When multi line mode is enabled in a → development/regular-expressions[regular expression], the two special characters
→ development/regular-expressions/anchors/start-end-of-line[`^` and `$`] not only match at the beginning or end of the input text, but also
right before or after a → development/line-break[new line].

Within a regular expression, multi line mode can be enabled with `→ development/regular-expressions#re-question-mark[(?]m)…` (Perl regexp flavor).

The following → Windows/PowerShell example tries to demonstrate the difference between default and multi-line mode:
-
By default, `$` does only match at the end of the input string;
code {
PS C:\> "one`ntwo`nthree" → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/string-manipulation#ps-replace[-replace] '$', ' EOL'
one
two
three EOL
code }

However, with mutli line mode, all «end of lines» are replaced;
code {
PS C:\> "one`ntwo`nthree" → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/string-manipulation#ps-replace[-replace] '(?m)$', ' EOL'
one EOL
two EOL
three EOL
code }

sa:

  With *single line mode* (which is not mutually exclusive to multi line mode), a dot `.` matches any character, including a new line.
