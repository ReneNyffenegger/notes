    Cluster: a set of *machines* aka *nodes*

    Nodes: a physical or virtual machine that runs containerized applications

    Pod: The atomic deployment unit of Kubernetes.
    -
    A Pod runs on *one* node, but a node can run mulitple Pods.

    One node is the *master node*.
    -
    The remaining nodes are called

    The master node is responsible for distributing work between the workers. *worker nodes*.

    The master node assigns Pods to nodes.

  { Logic

    Some notes taken from → https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf[Proposition as Types] by Philip Wadler.

    Origins of logic:
      • Aristotle and the stoics (classical Greece)
      • Ockham and the scholastics (middle ages)
      • Leibniz's vision of a *calculus ratiocinator* (dawn of the enlightenment)

    Contributors to formal logic
      • Boole
      • DeMorgan
      • Frege
      • Peirce
      • Peano

    Beginning of the 20th century: Whitehead and Russell publish → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica[Principia Mathematica] which demonstrates that formal logic could express a
    large part of mathematics.

    Inspired by this vision, Hilbert and his colleagues try to put ideas of *formal logic* on a firm foundation.

    Hilbert tries to develop an «effectively calculable» algorithm that is able to determine if a (any!) statement is true or false
   («Entscheidungsproblem»). Such an algorithm presuposes completeness.
    -
    1930, he says on the Mathematical Congress in Königsberg the words that are also engraved
    on his tombstompe: We must know, we will know.

    One day before Hilbert said these words, Gödel presented his proof
    that arithmetic is incomplete *at the same conference*!

    In order to demonstrate that the «Entscheidungsproblem» was undecidable,
    a formal definition of «effectively calculable» was needed.
    -
    Such a definition was provided by the work of
      • Alonzo Church (1936 - lambda calculus)
      • Gödel (1934 lectures in Princton, published 1936 by Stephen Kleen)
      • Alan Turing

    Gerhard Gentzen two new formulations of logic in 1935 which remain the two major systems for formulating a logic to this day:
      • Natural deduction
      • Sequent calculus
