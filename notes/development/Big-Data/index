{ Internet of Things (IoT) #iot

  A special subset of big data is the so called *Internet of Things*.

{ Lambda Architecture #big-data-lambda-architecture

 *Nathan Marz* proposes to deal with Big Data using a so-called *Lambda Architecture* that rests upon three layers:
  table { lll
    Batch layer ☰ redundant and distributed processing. It aims at its data being accurate. ☰ → development/Apache/Hadoop,  Snowflake, Redshift, Synapse and Big Query
    Speed layer ☰ procesing real time data faster than batch layer, but with less accuracy. As soon as batch layer is finsihed with its calculation, the results of the batch layer are merged into the speed layer. ☰ Apache Storm, → development/Apache/Spark, SQLstream, → Microsoft/Azure/products/Stream-Analytics, → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cosmos-DB
    Serving layer ☰ Stores results of speed and batch layer to be used for example for *ad-hoc queries*. ☰ Apache → development/Apache/Cassandra[Cassandra], → development/Apache/HBase[HBase], → development/Apache/Hive[Hive], Impala; Elasticsearch, → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cosmos-DB, MongoDB, VoltDB, Elephant DB, → development/databases/SAP-HANA[SAP HANA]
  table }

  The term *Lambda* is borrowed from the realm of → science/computer/Programming-paradigm/Functional-programming[functional programming]
  where a lambda function does not change data, but copy-modifies data for processing.
