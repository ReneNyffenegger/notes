$ Toad Editor
@ Editor

The Editor is the heart of → development/Software/TOAD.
-
Typically, a Toad user spends most time in either the Editor or the
→ development/Software/TOAD/Schema-Browser.

Anything (really anything?) that is possible with
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus can also done in the editor.

Statements that are executed with `F9` are recorded and can be «replayed»
with `F8`.
-
Alt+Arrow Up/Down allows to cycle through the statements in the recorded
buffer.

It's possible to name SQL statements. Named SQL statements are displayed
with `ctrl+n`.

~Code insight~ completes identifiers by pressing ctrl+period.
-
By default, the expansion of public
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms[synonym] names is disabled.
-
The time until expansion kicks in can be adjusted.

`F4` describes the object whose name is under the cursor.

{ Supported programming languages

  Toad supports six programming languages (for example C++, Delphi, Perl …).

  Using the *Make CODE Statement* from the Editor menu allows to convert the
  selected SQL statement into a code snippet of one of these languages and
  then paste it to the code file of that language.
