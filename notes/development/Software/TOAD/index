{ TOAD Options

  Enable ~Cancelling SQL Statements~: View -> TOAD Options -> SQL Editor -> check *Process statements in threads / allow queries to be cancelled*.

  Enable ~Timestamps~: View -> TOAD Options -> Data Types -> check *Include Timestamp/Interval Types (Orale 9i)*.

  ~nls_date_format~. Apparantly TOAD (or its developers) choose to disregard the value of `nls_date_format`. It must be changed by
  View -> TOAD Options -> Data Grids -> Data -> Display -> Dat format. (And even there, it's not possible to enter the format, it must
  be selected by drop down menues. WTF)
