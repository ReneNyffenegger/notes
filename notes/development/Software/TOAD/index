{ Editions

  TOAD is offered in five editions:
    • Base
    • Professional

{ TOAD Options

  Enable ~Cancelling SQL Statements~: View -> TOAD Options -> SQL Editor -> check *Process statements in threads / allow queries to be cancelled*.

  Enable ~Timestamps~: View -> TOAD Options -> Data Types -> check *Include Timestamp/Interval Types (Orale 9i)*.

  ~nls_date_format~. Apparently TOAD (or its developers) choose to disregard the value of `nls_date_format`. It must be changed by
  View -> TOAD Options -> Data Grids -> Data -> Display -> Date format. (And even there, it's not possible to enter the format, it must
  be selected by drop down menues. WTF)

}
{ TODO

  { Jump Search

?   Jump Search can be used to find Toad features and functionalites in all
    Toad Windows, menus and options by entering some keywords that describe
    the feature.

?   Jump Search is activated with `ctrl+j`


  }
  { Toad Data Point

    Toad Data Point allows to connect natively to other → development/databases[databases].

    Native connections can be established to the following databases:
      • IBM DB2 LUW or z/OS
      • → development/databases/SQL-Server
      • → development/databases/MySQL
      • Sybase ASE, SQL Anywhere or IQ

    → development/databases/ODBC connections can be established to any
    database that supports ODBC, for example:
      • → Companies-Products/Teradata
      • Informix
      • → development/databases/PostgreSQL

    It's also possible to connect to → development/databases/Access and → Microsoft/Office/Excel
    without ODBC.

?   Toad Data Poitn is available for free for Toad for Oracle users.

  }

}

sa:
  When using Toad, most time is
  typically spent in the → development/Software/TOAD/Editor (which is the heart of Toad) or
  the → development/Software/TOAD/Schema-Browser.
