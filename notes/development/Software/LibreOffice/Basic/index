$ Libre Office Basic

Like → development/languages/VBA, Libre Office Basic is not case sensitive.

{ Comments

  Comments can be introduced with `rem` or with a quote character:

code {
…
rem    This is a comment
 '     So is this
…
code }

}
{ Message boxes

code {
sub main

    dim answer as integer

    answer = msgBox("Should we go now?", mb_yesno)

    if     answer = idyes then
           msgBox "Let's go"
    elseif answer = idno  then
           msgBox "Let's stay here"
    else
           msgBox "This is rather unexpected"
    end if

end sub
code }

  { Print

   `Print` opens a message box, too. Is there nothing like VBA's `debug.print` in order to print messages to a console rather than a message box?
code {
sub main

    print "This opens a message box, too"

end sub
code }

  }

}
{ CreateUnoService

 `CreateUnoService` seems to be rather important function: it instantiates a *Uno service* (whatever this is) with the *ProcessServiceManager* (whatever this is).

  A list of services (that can be instantiated?) is → https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/namespacecom_1_1sun_1_1star.html[here].

  UNO stands for *Universal Network Objects*.

{ Calc

  { Resize column

code {
sub main

    dim sh       as object
    dim cols     as object
    dim col_2    as object

    sh   = thisComponent.getSheets().getByName("Sheet1")
    cols = sh.getColumns()
    
    col_2 = cols.getByName("B")

    print "current width is " & col_2.width
    col_2.width = 4000
  
end sub
code }

  }
  { Run VBA code #libre-office-basic-vba

    It possible to run → development/languages/VBA code in Libre Office:

code {
'      attribute VBA_ModuleType=VBAModule  
option VBASupport 1
 
sub main

    dim rng   as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range]

    set rng   =  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/index#excel-application-active-objects[activeSheet].range("B4")
    rng.value = "fourth row, second column"
 
end sub
code }

  }

}
