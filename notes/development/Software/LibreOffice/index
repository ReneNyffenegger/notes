LibreOffice (as also OpenOffice) consists of six programs: 
  • → development/Software/LibreOffice/Writer (Word Processor)
  • → development/Software/LibreOffice/Calc (Spreadsheets)
  • Impress (Presentations)
  • Draw (Diagrams and illustrations)
  • Base (→ development/databases[Database])
  • Math (Mathematical equations and formulas)


{ Turn off (so called) auto correction

  Tools -> AutoCorrect Options -> Options -> …

}
{ Don't show red curly underlines

  With *spell checking* turned on, Libre Office will mark misspelled words with a red curly underline.

  This can be toggled with *Tools -> Automated Spell Checking*, or possibly more easily with `Shift+F7`.

}
{ Macros

  { Add trusted location

    It seems that a document needs to be in a *trusted location* to run a macro.
    -
    If a document with macros is not at a trusted location, an error message is shown when the document is opened.

   *Tools -> Options -> Libre Office -> Security -> Macro Security -> Trusted Sources (tab)*.

    Requires a restart, apparently.

  } 
  { Recording macros

    Macros can be recorded if this feature is enabled using the menu
   *Tools -> Options -> Advanced*.

  }

}
{ User profile

   The → development/Software/LibreOffice/user-profile is the directory where user specific data is stored.

{ Exporting a document to PDF on the command line

{ History bits

  1985: StarWriter by Star Division.

  Between 1985 and 1999, StarWriter is renamed to StarOffice.

  1999: Sun Microsystems acquires Star Division and StarOffice with it.

  2000: Sun Microsystems releases source code of StarOffice as → development/open-source[Open-Source] and names it OpenOffice.org

  2010 (2011?): → development/databases/Oracle acquires Sun Microsystems and leads development of OpenOffice.org

  2010 (2011?): Because of Oracle's acquisition of OpenOffice.org, the source code base of OpenOffice.org is forked. Libre Office is born, hosted by Document Foundation.
