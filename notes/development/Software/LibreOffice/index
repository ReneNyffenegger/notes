{ Macros

  { Add trusted location

    It seems that a document needs to be in a *trusted location* to run a macro.
    -
    If a document with macros is not at a trusted location, an error message is shown when the document is opened.

    Tools -> Options -> Libre Office -> Security -> Macro Security -> Trusted Sources (tab).

    Requires restart, apparently.
