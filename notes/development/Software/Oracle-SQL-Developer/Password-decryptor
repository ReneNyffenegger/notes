$ Oracle SQL Developer password decryptor

Oracle SQL Developer allows a user to associate passwords with connections so that the user doesn't have to enter the password each time he opens a connection.

Of course, these passwords need to be stored somewhere. SQL developer stores them in an encrypted form, but it is possible to decrypt them.

In case of SQL developer version 4, two files are needed to find the information to encrypt these passwords. On Windows, these are
  • %APPDATA%\SQL Developer\system*\o.jdeveloper.db.connection*\connections.xml
  • %APPDATA%\SQL Developer\system*\o.sqldeveloper*\product-preferences.xml
(`%APPDATA%` typically has a value of `c:\user\username\AppData\Roaming`)

In `connections.xml`, one piece of the needed information is found in the `Contents` tag:
code {
<StringRefAddr addrType="password">
   <Contents>F35q3vdbVrI=</Contents>
</StringRefAddr>
code }

In `product-preferences.xml` the other pieced of the needed information is found in the following tag:
code {
<value n="db.system.id" v="3e8efb59-8a5a-4c13-b1d5-ff64f987787f"/>
code }

With these two values and the following → #decrypt-v4[Java program], you're now able to decrypt the password:
code {
java Decrypt_V4 F35q3vdbVrI= 3e8efb59-8a5a-4c13-b1d5-ff64f987787f
code }

{ Finding connections.xml and product-preferences.xml

  As the two required files are found under `%appdata%`, they are typically unaccessible for other users.

  However, there are at least two ways to access such files.

  { 1. Using a Linux live CD

     If you have physical access to the PC or laptop that has the `connections.xml` and `product-preferences.xml` *and* its harddisk
     is not encrypted, you can mount the PC harddisk with a Linux → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD[[live CD] (such as → http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html[Knoppix])  and copy the necessary information

  }
  { 2. Using dir /s /b on the company drive

    In many (big) companies, there is usually one or more »company drives« that all sorts of people and divisions or departments can store
    temporary files. Sometimes, database users backup their `conections.xml` and `product-preferences.xml` on such drives.

    Assuming this »company drive« is `X:`, then you can find these files in a `cmd.exe` window using
code {
cd /d X:
dir /s /b connections.xml product-preferences.xml
code }

  You might also be lucky searching *git* or *subversion* repositories etc.
