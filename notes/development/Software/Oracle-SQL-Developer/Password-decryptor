$ Oracle SQL Developer password decrtyptor

Oracle SQL Developer allows a user to associate passwords with connections so that the user doesn't have to enter the password each time he opens a connection.

Of course, these passwords need to be stored somewhere. SQL developer stores them in an encrypted form, but it is possible to decrypt them.

In case of SQL developer version 4, two files are needed to decrypt them. On Windows, these are
  • %APPDATA%\SQL Developer\system*\o.jdeveloper.db.connection*\connections.xml
  • %APPDATA%\SQL Developer\system*\o.sqldeveloper*\product-preferences.xml
(`%APPDATA%` typically has a value of `c:\user\username\AppData\Roaming`)

In `connections.xml`, find the tags
code {
<StringRefAddr addrType="password">
   <Contents>F35q3vdbVrI=</Contents>
</StringRefAddr>
code }

In `product-preferences.xml`, find the line reading
code {
<value n="db.system.id" v="3e8efb59-8a5a-4c13-b1d5-ff64f987787f"/>
code }

With these two values and the following Java programlet, you're now able to decrypt the password:
code {
java Decrypt_V4 F35q3vdbVrI= 3e8efb59-8a5a-4c13-b1d5-ff64f987787f
code }
