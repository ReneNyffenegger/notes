$ SQL Developer: User information directory

The SQL Develper user information directory is the location that stores the user preference settings for → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer].

Apparently, the location of this directory can be specified with the `SQLDEVELOPER_USER_DIR` → development/environment-variable[environment variable]. If this variable is not set,
the location defaults to → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/SQL-Developer[`$env:APPDATA\SQL Developer`] on → Windows.
