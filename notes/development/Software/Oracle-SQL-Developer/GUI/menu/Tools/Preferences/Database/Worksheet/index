{ New Worksheet to use unshared connection #sql-dev-new-worksheet-unshared-connection

  This option is required to allow multiple sessions for the same «connection specification» and thus to execute queries in parallel, each on in their separate tab.

  The value of this setting is stored in under the → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/directories/user-information[user information directory] in
  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/directories/user-information/systemV_W_X_Y_Z/o_sqldeveloper/product-preferences_xml[`SystemV.W.X.Y.Z/o.sqldeveloper/product-preferences.xml`]
