$ SQL Developer: Tools -> Preferences -> Code Editor -> Code Templates

Apparently, between version 19 and 21, the menu item *Code Templates* has moved from
→ development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/menu/Tools/Preferences/Database/SQL-Editor-Code-Templates[Tools -> Preferences -> Database -> SQL Editor Code Templates].

A *code template* is textual abbrevation for a predefined text snippet (the template). This abreviation is epxanded with `ctrl+space`.

The predefined code templates are stored in the file
→ development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/directories/user-information/CodeTemplate_xml[`CodeTemplate.xml`] under the
→ development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/directories/user-information[user information directory].
(In Windows the user information directory is → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/SQL-Developer[`%appdata%\SQL Developer`]).

The German name for this menu is *Extras -> Datenbank -> Codevorlagen für SQL-Editor*.

{ Code templates not triggered

  Sometimes, code templates are not triggered.

  I was unable to determine exactly when that's the case, but it seems that the current worksheet needs to be at least connected to
  a database.
  -
  Sometimes, the template was only triggered when I entered it directly at a lines beginning, i.e. no spaces before the abbreviation.
  -
  It also seemed that semicolons on the worksheet had an influence on the abbreviation being triggered.
  -
  At times, `ctrl+space` would open a *pop-up*, but then I'd still have to muse the cursor keys on the keyboard to select the text.

sa:

  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/menu/Tools/Preferences/Shortcut-Keys[Tools -> Preferences -> Shortcut Keys] and
  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/menu/View/Snippets[View -> Snippets]

  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/menu/Tools/Preferences/Code-Editor/Completion-Insight[Tools -> Preferences -> Code Editor -> Completion Insight]

  With the → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/SQL-Developer[PowerShell module SQL-Developer], its possible to add a code template with
 `add-SQLDeveloperCodeTemplate $abbr $expansion`.
