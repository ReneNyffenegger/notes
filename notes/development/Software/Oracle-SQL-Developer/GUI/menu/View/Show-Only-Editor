$ SQL Developer: View -> Show Only Editor

? Shows the editor (=→ development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/SQL-Worksheet?) only

The → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer

The → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer#sql-developer-keyboard-shortcuts[keyboard shortcut] to show the editor only is supposedly `ctrl+shift+enter`. However, it does not work on my installation.
