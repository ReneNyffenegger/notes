$ SQL Developer: File -> Open

{ Opening trace files

  Apparently, SQL Developer recognizes → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[trace files] when being opened.

  Alternatively, a *trace file* can also be dragged onto a → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/SQL-Worksheet[SQL Developer Worksheet] to have it formatted.

}

sa:
  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/menu/File/Reopen[File -> Reopen]
