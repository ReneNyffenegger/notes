$ Docker on Windows: Container Base Images

All *containers* are built on *container base images*.

Microsoft offers the following *container base images*
table { ll
 ~Container Base Image~ ☰ ~Description~
  → https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore[Windows Server Core] ☰ Traditional → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework applications
  → https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-nanoserver[Nano Server] ☰ → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Core applications
  → https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows[Windows] ☰ Traditional → Windows/development/WinAPI
  → https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-iotcore[Windows IoT Core] ☰ Internet of Things
table }

{ Installing a container base image

  Such a container base image can be *installed* on a command line.

  Note that the version number (`:1903`, `:1809`, …) needs to match
  the host OS version, but see below
  -
  Also, Docker needs to be configured to run Windows (as opposed to Linux) containers.
  -
  Otherwise, an error message similar to *no matching manifest for … in the manifest list entries* is thrown.

  First attempt: wrong version number:
code {
c:\>  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Docker/Docker/Resources/bin/docker_exe[docker] pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1903
1903: Pulling from windows/nanoserver
no matching manifest for windows/amd64 10.0.17763 in the manifest list entries
code }

  Second attempt: fixed version number:
code {
C:\> docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
1809: Pulling from windows/nanoserver
1951f408509b: Already exists
Digest: sha256:0711f47c5bbfbe16448287a2f1fdd6cfcfd6674f2044c1fe4e4a20ef79245dfe
Status: Downloaded newer image for mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
c:\>
code }

}
{ Host OS version needs to match container OS version

  The host OS version needs to match the container OS version because the  Windows kernel, unlike Linux's, does not
  have a stable API. Thus, the container images must have the same syscall-DLLs that the host OS also has.

  This is also the reason why Windows images are bigger than Linux images.
