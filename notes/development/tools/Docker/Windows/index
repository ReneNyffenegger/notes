$ Docker on Windows

The Docker Engine and client aren't included with Windows, they need to be installed and configured.

Apparently, the installation differs on → Windows/versions/Server and → Windows/versions/10.

→ development/tools/Docker on Windows consists of
  • Docker engine (→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Docker/Docker/Resources/dockerd_exe[`dockerd.exe`])
  • Docker client (→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Docker/Docker/Resources/bin/docker_exe[`docker.exe`])

{ Windows 10

  On Windows 10, → https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows[Docker Desktop] is needed. Unfortunately, it seems that a login (aka *Docker ID*) is needed to download the installer.

  System requirements are:
    • Windows 10, 64-bit, Pro, Enterprise or Education, Build 15063 or later
    • Enabled Windows features *Hyper-V* and *Containers*
    • Processor has *Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)*
    • 4GB Ram
    • → hardware/BIOS[BIOS] has *hardware virtualization support* enabled

  Docker Desktop includes
    • Docker Engine
    • Docker CLI client
    • Docker Compose
    • Docker Machine
    • Kitematic

  Docker Desktop allows to use *Windows Containers* and/or *Linux Containers*.

  Testing Docker after installation:
code {
C:\> docker run hello-world
code }

  A running *Docker Desktop* is shown in the *System Tray*:
