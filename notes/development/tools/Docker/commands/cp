$ docker cp

Copy a file or directory from a container to the local filesystem or vice versa:
code {
â†’ development/tools/Docker/commands[docker] cp $CONTAINERNAME:/home/rene/readme.txt ~/readme.txt
code }

The file/directory can be copied even if the container is stopped.

As far as I can tell, it's not possible to use the `*` for file globbing.
