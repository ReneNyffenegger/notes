$ docker cp

Copy a file or directory from a container to the local filesystem or vice versa:
code {
→ development/tools/Docker/commands[docker] cp $CONTAINERNAME:/home/rene/readme.txt ~/readme.txt
code }

The file/directory can be copied even if the container is stopped.

As far as I can tell, it's not possible to use the `*` for file globbing.

sa:
  The → development/tools/Docker/commands/run/volume[`-v`] option of `→ development/tools/Docker/commands/run` allows to bind («share») a volume between the host and the container.
