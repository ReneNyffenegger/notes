A Dockerfile contains instructions that specify how to build an → development/tools/Docker/image. The image is built with the → development/tools/Docker/commands/build[`docker build`] command.

{ Format of a Dockefile

  A dockerfile contains instructructions with arguments. Typically (but not necessarily), these arguements are written in uppercase letters.

code {
INSTRUCTION arguments
code }

  With the execption of `ARG`, a Dockefile must begin with a `FROM` instruction (which specifies the *parent image* from which a new image is built.

  Dockefiles allows *comments*: they look similar to those in shell script, → development/languages/Python or → Windows/PowerShell: they start with a `#` and continue to the end of the line. However, only white spaces are
  allowed to the left side of the `#` symbol.

 *Parser directives* look like a special form of comments:
code {
# directive=value
code }

}
{ Instructions

  { FROM #dockerfile-FROM

   `FROM` initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instruction.
code {
FROM → development/tools/Docker/image[<image>]
# or
FROM → development/tools/Docker/image[<image>] AS <name>
# or
FROM <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]
code }

    Using `ARG`:
code {
ARG env=prod
FROM im:${env}
code }

  }
  { RUN

    Executes a command in the current image and commits the result.

    The commited result is used as next «current image» in the next step.

code {
RUN <command> # shell form, executed using → Linux/fhs/bin/sh[/bin/sh -c command] (Linux) or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe /s /c command]
RUN ["executable", "argument-one", "argument-two", …]
code }

  }
  { CMD

   `CMD` provides defaults for for the resulting container.

    At most one `CMD` instruction is allowed in a Dockerfile.

  }
  { ENTRYPOINT #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT

   `ENTRYPOINT` configures a container that will run as an executable.

    Both, `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` define the commands that will be executed when running a container.

  }
  { LABEL #dockerfile-label

   `LABEL` adds metadata as a key/value pair to an image.

    Such added information can be viewed with → development/tools/Docker/commands/inspect[`docker inspect`].

code {
LABEL version=42.0
LABLE description=Hello world
code }

  }
  { MAINTAINER

   `MAINTAINER` sets the *Author* field of the generated image. This command is deprecated in favour of `LABEL`.

  }
  { EXPOSE #dockerfile-EXPOSE

   `EXPOSE` documents a → development/web/TCP-IP (default) or UDP port for a container.

    When running  the → development/tools/Docker/container, this or these ports are
    published with the `-p` or `-P` command line option in → development/tools/Docker/commands/run[`docker run`].

code {
EXPOSE 80  # TCP/IP 
code }

code {
EXPOSE 80/tcp
EXPOSE 67/udp
code }

  }
  { ENV #dockerfile-ENV

   `ENV` sets an → development/environment-variable[environment variable].

code {
ENV version=4.2
code }

  }
  { COPY / ADD #dockerfile-COPY-ADD

   `COPY` and `ADD` copy files and directories from outside a container into the container.

    Paths are interpreted as relative to the source of the context of the build.

   `ADD` allows the source to be an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url. Also, `ADD` handles → development/archive-files → https://stackoverflow.com/a/24958548/180275[differently]

code {
#    source      destination
#    ----------  -----------
COPY README.txt  /dev
COPY *.cs        /dev/src
code }

code {
#    source      destination
#    ----------  -----------
ADD  README.txt  /dev
ADD  *.cs        /dev/src
code }

    Docker on → Linux additionally has the `--chown` parameter to specify a owning → Linux/user[user] and a → Linux/group[group] for the copied file:
code {
ADD --chown=rene:dev *.cs /dev/src
code }

  }
  { VOLUME

   `VOLUME` creates a mount point.

  }
  { USER

   `USER` controls which user and group will be running the commands that were specified with `RUN`, `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.

  }
  { WORKDIR #dockerfile-WORKDIR

   `WORKDIR` sets the directory for subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY` and `ADD` commands.

code {
WORKDIR /dev/src
code }

  }
  { ARG #dockerfile-ARG

   `ARG` defines a variable whose value can be set when building the container with → development/tools/Docker/commands/build[`docker build`] (`--build-arg VAR=value`).
code {
ARG VAR
code }

    Predefined ARG variables are:`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `FTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`. These variables are also available in a lowercase version.
       • `

    Build time variables can be queried with → development/tools/Docker/commands/history[`docker history`].

  }
  { SCOPE

    …

  }
  { ONBUILD

   `ONBUILD` defines an instruction that is triggered when the built image is used as a base for another image.

  }
  { STOPSIGNAL

    …

  }
  { HEALTHCHECK

    …

  }
  { SHELL

   `SHELL` allows to override the default shell (`/bin/sh -c`, `cmd.exe /s /c`).

code {
SHELL ["powershell", "-command"]
RUN powershell-cmdLet
code }

  }

}
