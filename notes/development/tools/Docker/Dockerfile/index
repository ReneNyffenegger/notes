A Dockerfile contains instructions that specify how to build an → development/tools/Docker/image. The image is built with the → development/tools/Docker/commands/build[`docker build`] command.

{ Format of a Dockefile

  A dockerfile contains instructructions with arguments. Typically (but not necessarily), these arguements are written in uppercase letters.

code {
INSTRUCTION arguments
code }

  With the execption of → #dockerfile-arg[`ARG`], a Dockefile must begin with a `FROM` instruction (which specifies the *parent image* from which a new image is built).

  Dockerfiles allow *comments*: they look similar to those in shell script, → development/languages/Python or → Windows/PowerShell: they start with a `#` and continue to the end of the line. However, only white spaces are
  allowed to the left side of the `#` symbol.

 *Parser directives* look like a special form of comments:
code {
# directive=value
code }

}
{ Instructions

  table { ll
    `ADD` ☰ Add local or remote files and directories.
    `ARG` ☰ Use build-time variables.
    → #dockerfile-CMD[`CMD`] ☰ Specify the default command (or arguments executable defined with `ENTRYPOINT`) to be executed when the container is run. Compare with → #dockerfile-RUN[`RUN`]
    `COPY` ☰ Copy files and directories.
    `ENTRYPOINT` ☰ Specify default executable (default seems to be `["/bin/sh", "-c"]`)
    → #dockerfile-ENV[`ENV`] ☰ Set environment variables.
    → #dockerfile-EXPOSE[`EXPOSE`] ☰ Describe which ports your application is listening on. Used in conjunction with the `-P` option of `→ development/tools/Docker/commands/run`.
    → #dockerfile-FROM[`FROM`] ☰ Create a new build stage from a base image.
    `HEALTHCHECK` ☰ Check a container's health on startup.
    → #dockerfile-LABEL[`LABEL`] ☰ Add metadata to an image.
    `MAINTAINER` ☰ Specify the author of an image. *Deprecated* in favor of → #dockerfile-LABEL[`LABEL`].
    `ONBUILD` ☰ Specify instructions which are triggered then *this* image is used when building *another* image.
    → #dockerfile-RUN[`RUN`] ☰ Execute commands at *build time*. Compare with → #dockerfile-CMD[`CMD`]
    `SHELL` ☰ Set the default shell of an image.
    `STOPSIGNAL` ☰ Specify the system call signal for exiting a container.
    → #dockerfile-USER[`USER`] ☰ Set user and group ID.
    `VOLUME` ☰ Create volume mounts.
    → #dockerfile-WORKDIR[`WORKDIR`] ☰ Change working directory.
  table }

  { FROM #dockerfile-FROM

   `FROM` initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instruction.
code {
FROM → development/tools/Docker/image[<image>]
# or
FROM → development/tools/Docker/image[<image>] AS <name>
# or
FROM <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]
code }

    Using `ARG`:
code {
ARG env=prod
FROM im:${env}
code }

  }

  { ARG #dockerfile-ARG

   `ARG` defines a variable whose value can be set and used when building the image.
    -
    In contrast,  → #dockerfile-ENV[`ENV`] variables are used while a container of an image is running (see → development/tools/Docker/Dockerfile/instructions/vs/arg-env[`ARG` vs `ENV`]).

   with → development/tools/Docker/commands/build[`docker build`] (`--build-arg varname=value`).
code {
ARG varname
code }

    Predefined ARG variables are: `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `FTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`. These variables are also available in a lowercase version.

    Build time variables can be queried with `→ development/tools/Docker/commands/history`

  }
  { COPY / ADD #dockerfile-COPY-ADD

   `COPY` and `ADD` copy files and directories from outside a container into the container.

    Paths are interpreted as relative to the source of the context of the build.

   `ADD` allows the source to be an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL]. Also, `ADD` handles → development/archive-files → https://stackoverflow.com/a/24958548/180275[differently]

code {
#    source      destination
#    ----------  -----------
COPY README.txt  /dev
COPY *.cs        /dev/src
code }

code {
#    source      destination
#    ----------  -----------
ADD  README.txt  /dev
ADD  *.cs        /dev/src
code }

    Docker on → Linux additionally has the `--chown` parameter to specify a owning → Linux/user[user] and a → Linux/group[group] for the copied file:
code {
ADD --chown=rene:dev *.cs /dev/src
code }

  }
  { CMD #dockerfile-CMD

   `CMD` provides defaults for the resulting container.

    At most one `CMD` instruction is allowed in a Dockerfile.

    The specified command is executed as user and group specified with the → #dockerfile-USER[`USER`] directive.

    Compare with → #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT[`ENTRYPOINT`] and → #dockerfile-RUN[`RUN`]

    See also → development/tools/Docker/Dockerfile/instructions/vs/exec-vs-shell-form[shell form vs exec form]

  }
  { ENV #dockerfile-ENV

   `ENV` sets the value of → development/environment-variable[environment variable] when a container is running.
    -
    In contrast, the value of a variable being set with → #dockerfile-ARG[`ARG`] is available when a container is built (see → development/tools/Docker/Dockerfile/instructions/vs/arg-env[`ARG` vs `ENV`]).

code {
ENV version=4.2
code }


  }
  { ENTRYPOINT #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT

   `ENTRYPOINT` configures a container that will run as an executable.

    Both, → #dockerfile-CMD[`CMD`] and → #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT[`ENTRYPOINT`] define the commands that will be executed when running a container.

    The specified command is executed as user and group specified with the → #dockerfile-USER[`USER`] directive.

  }
  { EXPOSE #dockerfile-EXPOSE

   `EXPOSE` documents a → development/web/TCP-IP (default) or UDP port for a container.

    When running  the → development/tools/Docker/container, this or these ports are
    published with the `-P` command line option in `→ development/tools/Docker/commands/run`.

code {
EXPOSE 80  # TCP/IP 
code }

code {
EXPOSE 80/tcp
EXPOSE 67/udp
code }

  }
  { LABEL #dockerfile-label

   `LABEL` adds metadata as a key/value pair to an image.

    Such added information can be viewed with → development/tools/Docker/commands/inspect[`docker inspect`].

code {
LABEL version=42.0
LABLE description=Hello world
code }

  }
  { RUN #dockerfile-RUN

    Executes a command in the current image and commits the result.

    The committed result is used as next «current image» in the next step.

    Compare with → #dockerfile-CMD[`CMD`] and → #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT[`ENTRYPOINT`].

code {
# shell form: executed using → Linux/fhs/bin/sh[/bin/sh -c command] (Linux) or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe /s /c command]
RUN <command>

# «Other» form:
RUN ["executable", "argument-one", "argument-two", …]
code }

    The specified command is executed as user and group specified with the → #dockerfile-USER[`USER`] directive.

  }
  { SHELL

   `SHELL` allows to override the default shell (`/bin/sh -c`, `cmd.exe /s /c`).

code {
SHELL ["powershell", "-command"]
RUN powershell-cmdLet
code }

  }
  { USER #dockerfile-USER

   `USER` controls which user and group will be running the commands that were specified with → #dockerfile-RUN[`RUN`], → #dockerfile-CMD[`CMD`] and → #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT[`ENTRYPOINT`].

  }
  { WORKDIR #dockerfile-WORKDIR

   `WORKDIR` sets the directory for subsequent → #dockerfile-RUN[`RUN`], → #dockerfile-CMD[`CMD`], → #dockerfile-ENTRYPOINT[`ENTRYPOINT`], `COPY` and `ADD` commands.

code {
WORKDIR /dev/src
code }

  }
