$ Create a Docker image FROM SCRATCH

{ The C Program

  This is the source of the C program whose compiled executable we want to run in a docker container:
  gh|about-Docker|/image/create/from-scratch/prog.c||

}
{ Compiling the program

  We need to compile the program. I believe the `-static` flag is rather important because `SCRATCH` comes empty, i. e. without any C standard libraries. (But I should verify this assumption of mine):
  gh|about-Docker|/image/create/from-scratch/1-compile-prog||

}
{ Building the image from the executable and a dockerfile

  This is the → development/tools/Docker/Dockerfile we use to create the image …
  gh|about-Docker|/image/create/from-scratch/Dockerfile||

  … and the image is built with the following comand:
  gh|about-Docker|/image/create/from-scratch/2-build-image||

}
{ Run the image

  Now, we can run the image:
  gh|about-Docker|/image/create/from-scratch/3-run-image||

}

sa:
  → development/tools/Docker/image
