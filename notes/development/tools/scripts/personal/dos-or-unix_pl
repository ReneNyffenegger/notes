$ Script: dos-or-unix.pl

Quickly and easily determine if a file has DOS (`0x0d 0x0a`) or Unix (`0x0a`) line endings.

This → development/languages/Perl[perl] script only reads a file's first line (up to `0x0a`). If it ends in `0x0d 0x0a`, it will report the file as a »dos file«, otherwise
as a »unix file«.

code {
dos-or-unix *
code }
might print something like
code {
$dos-or-unix.pl *
admin.bat is unix
aqua.bat is unix
black.bat is dos
blue.bat is dos
cb.bat is dos
cdcb.bat is dos
find-equal-files.test is a directory
hex_dump.pl is unix
kill-procs.pl is unix
code }
