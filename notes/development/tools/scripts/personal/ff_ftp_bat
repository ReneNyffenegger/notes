$ Script: ff_ftp.bat

Opens a FireFox browser with a `ftp://` url and a username-password tuple.
The username, → development/security/password[password] and host need to be stored in the env variables tq84_XYZ_ftp_user, tq84_XYZ_ftp_pw and tq84_XYZ_ftp_host, respectively.
When the script is called, it expects a parameter that is expanded to a value (in example above: XYZ).
