$ paths.ps1

`paths.ps1` prints the individual components (directories, hopefully) of the → Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[`PATH`] or
the → Windows/development/environment-variables#win-envvar-PSModulePath[`PSModulePath`] environment variable on separate lines.

If a directory does not exist, it is prepended by an exclamation mark.
-
If a directory occurs multiple times, it is marked with an `x`.
-
If he user does not have certain privileges on the directory, it is marked with `A`. 

In order to print the components of `PSModulePath`, the `-PSModulePath` → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters/switch[switch] must be used.
