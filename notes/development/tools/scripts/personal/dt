$ Perl script: dt

`dt` can be used for simple date arithmetic in a shell.

Without arguments, it prints the current date:
code {
$dt 
2017-02-07 (Tu)
code }

If the argument is a number, it is interpreted as days. It will print the date in that many days:
code {
$dt 5
2017-02-12 (So)
code }

The argument can be suffixed with `w` in which case the argument is interpreted as weeks;
code {
$dt 1w
2017-02-21 (Tu)
code }

{ dt - the script
