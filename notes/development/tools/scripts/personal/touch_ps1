$ Script: touch.ps1
@ touch.ps1

`touch.ps1` is a very basic → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] which mimicks the (*IMHO*) two most important use cases of the Unix → Linux/shell/commands/touch[`touch`] command:
  • It creates a file if it does not exist, or
  • Updates an existing file's `lastAccessTime` and `lastWriteTime` with the current timestamp (`→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/date/get`).

The script accepts multiple files as string array (`[string[]]`), that is, their names must be separated by commas:
code {
PS → Windows/dirs/Users/username[C:\Users\Rene]> touch foo.txt, bar,txt, baz.txt
code }
