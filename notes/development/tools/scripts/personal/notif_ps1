$ notif.ps1

This is a → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] that opens a message box (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msg_exe[`msg.exe`]) at a specified date in the future

The scheduled time can be specified absolutely…
code {
notif 17:00 'time to go home'
code }

… or relatively. In the following example, the message box pops up in 7 minutes:
code {
notif +0:07 'do xyz'
code }

Using → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/date-time/arithmetic[date arithmetic] to run the notification *tomorrow at 10:58*.
code {
notif ([dateTime]::today + '1.10:58')  'release meeting'
code }

The `-g` option was originally used for rudimentary debugging. It now simpily shows the scheduled messages:
code {
notif -g
code }
