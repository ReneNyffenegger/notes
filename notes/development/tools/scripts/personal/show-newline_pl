$ Script: show-newline.pl

Show → development/line-break[line endings] (`0x0A` and/or `0x0D`).

This tool proved helpful to find strange bugs with files that had Unix and DOS line endings mixed.

The output of `show-newline.pl --nof-lines 10 $(which show-newline.pl)` is
code {
   1| #!/usr/bin 0A
   2| #          0A
   3| #   Show l 0A
   4| #          0A
   5| #   Won't  0A
   6| #          0A
   7| #   See al 0A
   8| #          0A
   9| use warnin 0A
  10| use strict 0A
code }

{ TODO

  If the file that is looked at with `show-newline.pl` does not end with a `0x0a` or `0x0a0x0d`, the last line is not printed or reported as having no new line.
  -
  This behaviour should be fixed.
