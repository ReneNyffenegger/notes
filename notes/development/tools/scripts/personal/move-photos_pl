$ Script: move-photos.pl

`move-photos.pl` is a → development/languages/Perl[perl] script that moves files from one directory to directories that contain the file's → Linux/filesystem/file-directory-metadata#fs-amt-time[ctime] in the path.

For example, if the file's mtime is August 28th, 2018, it places the file into a subdirectory named `08-28` which is underneath the directory `2018`.

Directories are created as they are needed.

Currently, only files that have a '.jpg' or 'mp4' suffix are moved. This is because I need the script to undump the many photos of a camera's memory card.
