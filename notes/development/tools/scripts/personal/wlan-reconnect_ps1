$ wlan-reconnect.ps1

`wlan-reconnect.ps` is a → Windows/PowerShell script that uses the cmdlet
`→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/connection/test` to regularly check the → development/networking/WLAN connection and tries to reconnect with
`→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe/wlan` if it is gone.

This script was somewhat useful when I had to work in a room with a shaky WLAN.

If executed without parameter, it tries to connect to the SID named *oooOOOooo*. If executed with a parameter, the parameter is expected to be the name
of the SID that the scripts should connect to:
code {
wlan-reconnect OfficeX
code }

The `-speak` flag can be specifed so that the script uses the → Windows/development/COM/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Speech to notify a change in the
connection status:
code {
wlan-reconnect OfficeX -speak
code }
