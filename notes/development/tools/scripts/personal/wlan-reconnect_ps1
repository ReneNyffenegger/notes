$ wlan-reconnect.ps1

`wlan-reconnect.ps` is a → Windows/PowerShell script that regularly checks the → development/networking/WLAN connection and tries to reconnect if it is gone.

This script was somewhat useful when I had to work in a room with a shaky WLAN.

If executed without parameter, it tries to connect to the SID named *oooOOOooo*. If executed with a paramter, the parameter is expected to be the name
of the SID that the scripts should connect to:
code {
wlan-reconnect OfficeX
code }

{ Script
