$ regat.bat

*regat* stands for *→ Windows/registry at*.

`regat.bat` is called with the name of a  → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key]. It then opens the
→ Windows/registry at the specified key using → Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`].

The script replaces `HKCU` with → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`], `HKLM` with → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`] and
`HKCR` with → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`].

If `regat` is called with the special parameter `env`, it opens the registry at → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`].
-
If called with `globenv`, it opens the global counterpart at → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session-Manager/Environment[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment`].

If `regat` is called with the special parameter `clsid` followed by a → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] (in curly braces), it opens this GUID under
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/GUID[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{…guid…}`].

If called with `svc` it opens the registry under
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`] (which stores the
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/services_exe[Service Control Manager (SCM)] database).

If the script is given the special option `-m`, it opens *another* regedit Windows. Thus, effectively, without `-m` it actually passes `/m` to
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`].

A potentially running → Windows/development/process[process] of → Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`] needs to be killed with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/taskkill_exe[`taskkill.exe`] in order for `regedit` to show the desired key.

{ Windows 10

  This script became a bit less important in Windows 10 because → Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`] now allows to paste a path to a
  → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] into a text box.

  This problem is now fixed.

sa:
  → development/tools/scripts/personal/regQuery_bat[`regQuery.bat`] can be used to query the → Windows/registry[registry] in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] for a specific value under a given key.

  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Applets/Regedit/LastKey[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit`: LastKey]

  → development/tools/scripts/personal/op-reg-at_pl[`op-reg-at.pl`]: a → development/languages/Perl[Perl] script that does almost the same thing.

  The → Windows/tools/Sysinternals[Sysinternals] tool → Windows/tools/Sysinternals/regjump is an
  → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executable] (rather than a batch file) that does pretty much the same thing like `regat.bat`.
