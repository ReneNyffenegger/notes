$ Script: yt2mp3.ps1

`yt2mp3.ps1` is a → Windows/PowerShell script that uses → tools/youtube-dl[`youtube-dl.exe`] to convert a youtube movie to mp3. I use this script to download talks, discussions and speeches to
listen to them during a car ride.

The script fetches the → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] that needs to be downloaded from the → Windows/clipboard.
