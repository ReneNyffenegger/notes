$ Script: yt2mp3.ps1

`yt2mp3.ps1` is a → Windows/PowerShell script that uses → tools/youtube-dl[`youtube-dl.exe`] to convert a youtube (and since 2020-09-14 also bitchute)
movies to mp3.

I use this script to download talks, discussions and speeches to listen to them during a car ride.

The script fetches the → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] that needs to be downloaded from the → Windows/clipboard.

By default, it process the download and conversion in a → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/job[job]. The default can be overwritten with the `-noJob` argument.
