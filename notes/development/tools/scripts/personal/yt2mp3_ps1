$ Script: yt2mp3.ps1

`yt2mp3.ps1` is a → Windows/PowerShell script that uses → tools/youtube-dl[`youtube-dl.exe`] to convert a youtube (and since 2020-09-14 also bitchute)
movies to mp3.

I use this script to download talks, discussions and speeches to listen to them during a car ride.

The script fetches the → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] that needs to be downloaded from the → Windows/clipboard and saves the downloaded file to
`→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Temp[$env:temp]/mp3`. (TODO: this directory should possibly be created if it does not exist)

By default, it processes the download and conversion in a → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/job[job]. The default can be overwritten with the `-noJob` argument.

If the script finds an mp3 whose filename contains the *id* of the downloaded movie, the movie won't be downloaded again.

code {
yt2mp3 -noJob
yt2mp3        interesting-talk
yt2mp3 -noJob interesting-talk
