$ grep-r.py

`grep-r.py` is a → development/languages/Python script that rudimentarily searches for → development/regular-expressions[regular expressions] in files (in the current version with an `.sql` → development/filename-extensions[suffix]).

Contrary to → Linux/shell/commands/grep[`grep`], it does not print the entire line that mached but only the portion of the regular expression.

It is also different from `grep` in that it prints the filename of the matched string after the matched portion. This behaviour is so chosen in order to be able to pipe the result of `grep-r.py` into
a program that sorts its input (such as → Linux/shell command → Linux/shell/commands/sort[`sort`] or Powershell's command → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/sort[`sort-object`]).

{ TODO


  Of course, it should be possible to state the desired suffix to search for patterns on the command line.

  How found matches are displayed should also be configurable from the command line.

  The encoding of the searched files is currently hardcoded to *latin1*. This is probably less than desirable.
