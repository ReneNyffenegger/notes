{ Some functions

  table { ll
    `update-profile` ☰ Update the profile script from github (Compare with → #profile-install)
    `prompt` ☰ Customizes the *prompt* to include the «next» history id (to be used with *tab completion* and `#…`) and to replace the backward slash with a forward slash. Print the value of → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/lastExitCode[`$lastExitCode`] in red if it differs from `0`.
    `admin` ☰ Starts a new Powershell session with administrator privileges
    `cd` ☰ A function that replaces the default → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias `cd` so that it sets the (new) → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variable] `$oldPWD` (see → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[`$pwd`]) and `cd -` changes to the directory I came from (as being used from a → Linux/shell[Unix shell]) (Idea adapted from → https://gist.github.com/naiduv/c975528f02aed8e20232dfb366b41e14[Venkut Naidu's Github gist])
    `fb` ☰ Find below: finds files that match a given wildcard below the current directory and prints their full path, without distracting headers for each directory
    `paths` ☰ A function that prints the individual components (directories, hopefully) of the → Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[`PATH` environment variable] on separate line. If a directory does not exist, it is prepended by an exclamation mark.
