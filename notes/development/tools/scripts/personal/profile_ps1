    `admin` ☰ Starts a new Powershell session with administrator privileges
    `cd` ☰ A function that replaces the default → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias `cd` so that it sets the (new) → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variable] `$oldPWD` (see → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[`$pwd`]) and `cd -` changes to the directory I came from (as being used from a → Linux/shell[Unix shell]) (Idea adapted from → https://gist.github.com/naiduv/c975528f02aed8e20232dfb366b41e14[Venkut Naidu's Github gist])
    `fb` ☰ find below: finds files that match a given wildcard below the current directory and prints their full path, without distracting headers for each directory
