$ Perl script: Spliting and merging huge files

`split-file.pl` splits a (huge) file into many smaller files, for example so that the can be more easily transported.
code {
$ split-file.pl huge-file
code }
This creates `huge-file.000`, `huge-file.001`, `huge-file.002` …

After transporting, the files can be merged again into the original file with
code {
$ merge-file.pl huge-file
code }

{ split-file.pl #split-file

gh|scripts-and-utilities|/split-file.pl||

}

{ merge-file.pl #merge-file

gh|scripts-and-utilities|/merge-file.pl||

}
