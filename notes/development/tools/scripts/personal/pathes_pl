$ Scripts: pathes.pl and paths

{ paths#paths

  `paths` shows each path in 
  → development/environment-variable#path[`$PATH`] on a seperate line in a → Linux/shell[Unix shell].

  gh|scripts-and-utilities|/paths||
}
{ pathes.pl#pathes_pl

  Since → Windows does not come with → Linux/shell/commands/tr[`tr`], this → development/languages/Perl script does the same in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`]
  (although it also works in → Linux).
  
  Additionally, the script can be passed the name of a file to be searched in `%PATH%`.
