$ Scripts: paths.pl and paths

{ paths#paths

  `paths` shows each path in 
  → development/environment-variable#path[`$PATH`] on a separate line in a → Linux/shell[Unix shell].

}
{ paths.pl#paths_pl

  Since → Windows does not come with → Linux/shell/commands/tr[`tr`], this → development/languages/Perl script does the same in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`]
  (although it also works in → Linux).
  
  Additionally, the script can be passed the name of a file to be searched in `%PATH%`.

{ TODO

  The file name for this page should not be *pathes*.

  The page should possibly be merged with → development/tools/scripts/personal/paths

}

sa:

  → development/tools/scripts/personal/paths[`paths.ps1`] is a similar script for → Windows/PowerShell.
