CMake is a cross-platform, open-source → development/make[Makefile] generator that is supposed to help managing build processes.

{ Invoking

Unlike `make`, `cmake` usually is not invoked in the same directory as the project (= *out of source build*).

code {
$ cmake path/to/project
code }
creates a `Makefile` in the *current* directory.

The instructions for the Makefile are found in `path/to/project/CMakeLists.txt`.

}
{ CMakeLists.txt

  A CMakeLists.txt can reference CMakeLists.txt in other sub-directories.

}
{ Forcing to print the building statements

  The `Makefile` generated by CMake can be forced to print the building commands with `make VERBOSE=1`.

}
