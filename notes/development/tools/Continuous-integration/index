The *goal* of continuous integration is to *eliminate integration hell* by catching bugs early.
-
For that end, a CI solution regularly merges, builds and tests source code. This allows to catch bugs
early in the development cycle when they're easier and faster to fix.

→ development/Software-design/methods/XP[XP]: use in combination with automated test scripts.

Artifacts that are produced by continues integration are deployed to test and production environments with
→ development/tools/Continuous/delivery[continuous delivery].

Distinguish from *frequent integration*.

A ~build server~ runs the unit tests automatically and periodically or after a commit. It returns the result to the developer.
