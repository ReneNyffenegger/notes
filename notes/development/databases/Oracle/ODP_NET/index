$ ODP.NET

ODP.NET is part of *Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC)*. ODAC can be downloaded from OTN.

? An ODP.NET driver has two components:
  • .NET functionality, which needs
  • native OCI

{ Locating OCI DLLs

  ODP.NET tries to locate the native OCI → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs] with the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/value[value] under the
  `→ Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ORACLE/ODP_NET[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\ODP.NET]\version` (version begin something like `2.122.18.1`, `4.122.18.1`).
  -
  This value is supposed to store a path, typically → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin[`%ORACLE_HOME%\bin`].

}
{ Driver Types

  ODP.NET comes with three types of drivers:
   • → development/databases/Oracle/ODP_NET/drivers/managed[ODP.NET, Managed Driver] (fully → Microsoft/dot-net → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code).
   • → development/databases/Oracle/ODP_NET/drivers/unmanaged[ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver] (Contains more features than the managed driver)
   • *ODP.NET Core* (allows to build multi-platform → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Core applications)

  *ODP.NET, Managed Driver* consists of fewer → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs] than *ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver*. Hence, the installation size of the Managed Driver is
  smaller than that of the Unmanaged Driver.
  
  *ODP.NET Core* is similar to the *ODP.NET, Managed Driver* yet with reduced set of provided APIs. Both use the same *namespaces*.

  *ODP.NET, Managed Driver* and *ODP.NET Core* are built with *AnyCPU*, thus they run on either 32-bit or 64-bit (x64) .NET Framework and on either 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.
   -
  *ODP.NET Core* also runs on Oracle Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  As of 18c, *ODP.NET Core* follows the → Microsoft/dot-net/Standard 2.0 specification.

  *ODP.NET Core* is compatible wtih ASP.NET Core 2.x and ASP.NET.

{ Misc

  *ODP.NET* and *Microsoft .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle* are not the same thing. The former is developed by Oracle, the latter by Microsft.

  ODP.NET requires an installed Oracle Client to be installed when used to establish connections to an Oracle server.
