$ SQL*Plus: connect
@ connect

`connect`
  • commits the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction, then
  • disconnects the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session, then
  • reconnects with the specified username/password to the indicated instance.

Starting with 10g, `connect` executes `glogin.sql` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/sqlpath/login`

When successfully connected, SQL*Plus responds with `Connected.` Unfortunately, this behavior cannot be turned of by setting
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/feedback[`feedback`] to `off` (even when running scripts).

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus
