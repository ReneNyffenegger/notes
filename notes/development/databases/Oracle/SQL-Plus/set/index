{ Saving the current values

  The currently active values (either the default values or the ones overwritten with a `set` comman) can be saved into a file with
code {
SQL> → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/store set set-values.sql
code }

  Later, this file can be sourced in order to have the same settings again:
code {
SQL> → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/start[@] set-values.sql
code }

}
