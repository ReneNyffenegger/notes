$ SQL*Plus: SET AUTOTRACE
@ set autotrace

When the corresponding setting of *autotrace* are enabled, → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus displays an
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL Statement's] → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan] and some execution statistitics after
executing the statement in SQL*Plus.

{ Settings

  The following settings can be enabled with autotrace.

table { ll
  `set autotrace off` ☰ The default: it nothing is reported
  `set autotrace on explain` ☰ Only display the → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer[optimizer] execution path.
  `set autotrace on statistics` ☰ Only → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement] execution statistics.
  `set autotrace on` ☰ Display both the optimizer execution path and the SQL statement execution statistics.
  `set autotrace traceonly` ☰ Like `set autotrace on` but do not print SQL statement results.
table }

  Compare with the `AUTOTRACE` system variable.

}
{ Reported statistics

  If autotrace is enabled with statistics, it reports the following ones
    • recursive calls
    • db block gets
    • consistent gets
    • physical reads
    • redo size
    • bytes sent via SQL*Net to client
    • bytes received via SQL*Net from client
    • SQL*Net roundtrips to/from client
    • sorts (memory)
    • sorts (disk)
    • rows processed (which is not found in `v$statname`).

}
{ Prerequisites

  In order to use the autotrace feature, a user must have
    • A → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[`PLAN_TABLE`] in his schema and
    • The `PLUSTRACE` → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles enabled.


  A plan table can be created with the `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catplan_sql` script.

  The `PLUSTRACE` role is created with the `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/sqlplus/admin/plustrce_sql` script. This role grants the
  necessary privileges to access the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views[dynamic performance views]
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sesstat`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/statname`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/mystat`

code {
$ sqlplus / as sysdba
SQL> @?/sqlplus/admin/plustrce.sql
SQL> grant plustrace to rene;
code }

}
{ No autotrace with enabled FIPS flagging

  With FIPS flagging (i.e. setting → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/flagger[`flagger`] to a value different from `off`), autotrace is not available and causes
    • SP2-0575: Use of Oracle SQL feature not in SQL92 Entry Level
    • SP2-0612: Error generating AUTOTRACE … report
