$ SQL*Plus: SET ARRAYSIZE
@ set arraysize

The value of `arraysize` specifies the number or records that SQL*Plus fetches from the database in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statements].

The maximum value for `arraysize` is 5000.

{ Setting ARRAYSIZE to 1

  Setting the `ARRAYSIZE` will fetch the first row and the next row in batches of two rows.

  As explained by MOS Note 1265916.1, this is because SQL*Plus uses OCI which has a default prefetch value of 1.
  -
  Thus, the first fetch call returns 1 row becaue of this prefetch value. The next fetch calls will return 1
  row for `arraysize=1` and an additional row which is prefetched.

  See also Bug 9103343.

sa:

  The default value of `arraysize` is changed to 100 when using SQL*Plus's → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/_command-line/options/fast[command line option `-fast`].

  SQL*Plus' `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set` commands such as `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/rowprefetch`

  The value of `arraysize` also specifies the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/copy#sqlplus-copy-arraysize[batch size] for the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/copy` command.
