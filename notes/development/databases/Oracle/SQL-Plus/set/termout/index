$ SQL*Plus: SET TERMOUT
@ set termout

`set termout off` prevents text (results of queries, `prompt` etc.) from being written (echo'ed) to the terminal *if* the text originates from a statement in an
SQL script started with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/start[`start`, `@` or `@@`].
-
Output whose origin is a statement that is typed interactively or redirected (STDOUT | STDIN) to SQL*Plus is not affected by the value of `termout`.

In order to display text again, `set termout on` must be used.

  `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/echo`

  `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/feedback`
