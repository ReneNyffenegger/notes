$ SQL*Plus: EXECUTE
@ execute

`execute` (or its abbreviation `exec`) embeds the given text into a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/[`begin … ; end;`] block (note the `;` after the repaced text) and executes it.

code {
exec → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[dbms_output].put_line('Today is ' || → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to/char(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate, 'yyyy-mm-dd'))
code }

`exec` can be used to assign a value to a bind variable:
code {
variable num number
exec :num := 42
select * from xyz where id = :num; 
code }


Using `execute` does not change SQL*Plus' buffer.

sa:

  The *slash* «command».
