$ SQL*Plus: COPY
@ copy

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus `copy` command copies the result of an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statement] to another → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database.

code {
COPY {FROM database | TO database | FROM database TO database} {APPEND|CREATE|INSERT|REPLACE} [destTableName] { (column) } USING select-statement
code }

The behavior on the destination database is optionally specified with one of the following verbs:
  • `append`: Append the selected rows to an existing table, or create a table and insert the rows if the table does not exist
  • `create`: Create the destination table and insert the selected rows - fails if table already exists
  • `insert`: Insert the selected rows into the destination table - fails if table does not exist
  • `replace`: deletes (truncates?) rows in destination table before inserting selected rows. If table does not exist, it is created.


{ Supported datatypes

  Only five → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] are supported:
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/char`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/long` (but be sure to set a reasonable value for the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/long[`long`] variable)
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/number`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2`

  Trying to copy another datatype (notably `clob` or `blob`!) results in the error message *CPY-0012: Datatype cannot be copied*.

}
{ ARRAYSIZE #sqlplus-copy-arraysize

  The SQL*Plus variable → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/arraysize[`arraysize`] specifies the number of rows that SQL*Plus fetches from the source data base and copies to the destination database.

}
{ Transaction handling

  When SQL*Plus has sucessfully copied the selected rows, it → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[commits] the transaction

  In addtion, the SQL*Plus variable `copycommit` can be set in which case each batch (of size `arraysize`) will be commited.

}
{ CPY-0007: Select list has fewer columns than destination table

  For `append` operations or `insert` operations with an already existing table, the number of selected columns must correspond to the number of columns in the select statement after the `using` clause, otherwise
  SQL*Plus throws a *CPY-0007* error.
