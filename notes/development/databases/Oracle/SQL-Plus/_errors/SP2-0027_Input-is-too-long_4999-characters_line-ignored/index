$ SP2-0027: Input is too long (> 4999 characters) - line ignored

This is the year 2023, Oracle has released → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c and Oracle's → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus does still not allow to read lines that are longer than 4999 characters.
-
After *variable substitution* (if any), a line must not be longer than 3000 characters, otherwise a
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/_errors/SP2-0341_line-overflow-during-variable-substitution error is thrown.

  { Creating SQL scripts

    Four SQL scripts are created: `/tmp/3001.sql`, `/tmp/3002.sql`, `/tmp/4999.sql` and `/tmp/5000.sql`.

    The number in the filename corresponds to the number of characters in the first line (including new line):
code {
printf "%-2999s;\nexit\n" "select '3001' len from dual" > /tmp/3001.sql
printf "%-3000s;\nexit\n" "select '3002' len from dual" > /tmp/3002.sql
printf "%-4997s;\nexit\n" "select '4999' len from dual" > /tmp/4999.sql
printf "%-4998s;\nexit\n" "select '5000' len from dual" > /tmp/5000.sql
code }

    Using `→ Linux/shell/commands/wc` to verify the length of the first lines:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/head -1 /tmp/3001.sql | → Linux/shell/commands/wc -c
→ Linux/shell/commands/head -1 /tmp/3002.sql | → Linux/shell/commands/wc -c
→ Linux/shell/commands/head -1 /tmp/4999.sql | → Linux/shell/commands/wc -c
→ Linux/shell/commands/head -1 /tmp/5000.sql | → Linux/shell/commands/wc -c
code }

  }  
  { Executing the scripts

    The scripts are now executed in SQL*Plus.

     SQL*Plus can execute files whose maximum line length is 3000 characters (without new line):
code {
$ sqlplus -S rene/rene@localhost/freepdb1 @/tmp/3001.sql

LEN
----
3001
code }

  However, adding *one* character does not permit to execute the script anymore:
code {
$ sqlplus -S rene/rene@localhost/freepdb1 @/tmp/3002.sql
SP2-0341:
line overflow during variable substitution (>3000 characters at line 1)
code }

  Still the same error with 4999 characters:
code {
$ sqlplus -S rene/rene@localhost/freepdb1 @/tmp/4999.sql
SP2-0341:
line overflow during variable substitution (>3000 characters at line 1)
code }

  As soon as the input length reaches 5000 characters, a different error is thrown:
code {
$ sqlplus -S rene/rene@localhost/freepdb1 @/tmp/5000.sql
SP2-0027: Input is too long (> 4999 characters) - line ignored
code }

  }
