`new_value` is used to select a value into a user variable: 

In the following example, two tables are created (`new_value_test_from` and `new_value_test_to`).

*One* record is inserted into `new_value_test_from`.

This record's only field is selected (and by means of `new_value`) assigned to the varlable `var`.

Then, the value of this variable is inserted into the other table, `new_value_test_to`.

If there are *more than one rows* in the record set, the variable is assigned with the value of the last record:
