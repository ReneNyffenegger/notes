$ SQL*Plus: TIMING
@ timing

With `timing`, it's possible to have → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus measure the time for multiple statements and then print the elapsed time. This is in contrast to
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/timing[`set timing on`] which prints the elapsed time for *each* encountered statement.

Multiple concurrent timers can be started and SQL*Plus automatically nests them.

code {
timing start "Installation"

timing start "Create schema"
@create-schema.sql
timing stop

timing start "Fill tables"
@fill-tables.sql
timing stop

timing start "Run analysis"
@run-analysis
timing stop

timing stop
code }

sa:

  After → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/timing[`set timing on`], → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus prints the elapsed time for each statement it submits to the database.
