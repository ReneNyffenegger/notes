$ SQL*Plus: start
@ start

`start script.sql` runs (executes) the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements] recorded in `script.sql`.

SQL*Plus searches for the indicated file in the current directory first and then in the directories that are pointed at by
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/sqlpath[`$SQLPATH`].

The `@` can also be used on the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/start/run-SQL-script-from-command-line[command line when SQL*Plus is invoked] to start a script file.

}
{ Question mark

  The question mark is replaced with the value of → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n[`ORACLE_HOME`] which makes installing scripts (notably those found under
  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdmbs/amdin`]) a bit easier:
code {
rene@ora19> @?/→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utlsampl_sql[rdbms/admin/utlsqmpl]
code }

}

sa:
