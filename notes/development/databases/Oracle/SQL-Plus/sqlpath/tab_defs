$ SQLPATH - tab_defs
@ tab_defs.sql

Extract `create table` statements for the tables in one's schema.

The script, when run, creates the file `table_defs_get_ddl.sql` which in turn needs to be run. This second script creates an sql file in a directory (than manually must be created) named `table_defs`.
