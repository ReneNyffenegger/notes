$ SQLPATH - login.sql
@ login.sql

This SQL script is the *user profile* script.

Before Oracle 12R2, this script was automatically executed when → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus was started if  the `$ORACLE_PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable] pointed to the
directory in which the script was located.

When this mechanism was still working, the script was executed after also executing the *site profile* (→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/sqlplus/admin/glogin_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql`])

Apparently, → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl finds the `login.sql` if it is pointed at with `SQLPATH` rather than `ORACLE_HOME`.

{ login.sql

  The following `login.sql` script sets a few → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus settings to make working easier (imho) and alters the
  prompt of SQL*Plus to show the connected user name and service name or database name (depending on what is commented out).
