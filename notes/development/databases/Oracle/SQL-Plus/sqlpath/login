$ SQLPATH - login.sql
@ login.sql

This SQL script is the *user profile* script.

{ login.sql not automatically executed


  Before Oracle 12R2, this script was automatically executed when → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus was started if  the `$SQLPATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable] pointed to the
  directory in which the script was located.

  When this mechanism was still working, the script was executed after also executing the *site profile* (→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/sqlplus/admin/glogin_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql`])

  In Linux/Unix environment, the file is executed if the environment variable `ORACLE_PATH` points to the directory where `login.sql` is located.

rem {
  Apparently, → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl finds the `login.sql` if it is pointed at with `SQLPATH` rather than `ORACLE_HOME`.
rem }

}
{ login.sql

  The following `login.sql` script sets a few → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus settings to make working easier (imho) and alters the
  prompt of SQL*Plus to show the connected user name and service name or database name (depending on what is commented out).
