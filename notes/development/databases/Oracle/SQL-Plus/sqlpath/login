$ SQLPATH - login.sql
@ login.sql

This SQL script is the *user profile* script. It is executed when → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus is started, after the *site profile* (→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/sqlplus/admin/glogin_sql)

Apparently, in order to be found, it must be pointed to by the `$ORACLE_PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable].
