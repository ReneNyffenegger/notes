$ SQLPATH - slash-error
@ slash-error.sql

`slash-error.sql` expects its only parameter to be the path of a script (file) to a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL object (package, package body, …) *without* a trailing slash. The
script the reads the content of the file (→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/start[`@…`]) and then adds a slash so that the object gets compiled and then also executes 
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/show/errors[`show errors`].

This script was once necessary because I worked in an environment where the rule was that slashes and/or `show errors` statements were prohibited in the source code repository, but I wanted to have a
*one liner* that installed a PL/SQL object *and* showed errors (if any).
