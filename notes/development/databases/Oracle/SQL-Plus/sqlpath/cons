$ SQLPATH - cons
@ cons.sql

`cons.sql` is an SQL script that displays information about a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints[constraint].

{ Example

  I try to run a script that inserts some data into a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table]. Unfortunately, the
  script violates a *check constraint*:
code {
tq84@thedb> @fill-sales-hist

insert into tq84.sales_hist
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-02290: check constraint (TQ84.SYS_C001013371) violated
code }

  The name of the violated constraint is quite undecipherable: `TQ84.SYS_C001013371`.
  -
  So, what does this contraint refer to? `cons.sql` might be helpful:

code {
dwh_dm_riskfinance@THEDB> @cons TQ84.SYS_C001013371

Owner:  TQ84
constraint name  SYS_C001013371
type: C
  Check constraint

     Condition: valid_from < valid_to

     Table:     SALES_HIST
     Columns:   VALID_TO
                VALID_FROM
code }

}
{ cons.sql
