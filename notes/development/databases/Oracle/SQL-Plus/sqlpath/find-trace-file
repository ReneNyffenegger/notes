$ SQLPATH - find-trace-file.sql
@ find-trace-file.sql

*Note*: the following SQL script is quite old. When I originially wrote it, possibly more than 15 years ago, it was supposed to find the location of a
«my» → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[trace file]. Yet, I just found out today,
that it does not correctly work. Better seems to be → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/sqlpath/tracefile[`tracefile.sql`].

gh|Oracle-SQLPATH|/find-trace-file.sql||

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/sqlpath

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[Trace files]
