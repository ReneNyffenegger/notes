$ Oracle Performance and tuning
@ performance and tuning

A → development/databases[database] has a *performance problem* if it is not able to complete and deliver the requested tasks or specified workload in timely fashion, that is, if the answer times put the stakes of an organization at risk.

{ Throughput

  Throughput is the amount of work that can be done in a specific amount of time.

}
{ Typical causes of performance problems

  Typical problems are
    • → hardware/CPU[CPU] bottlenecks
    • Too little memory (see → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/memory-management)
    • Too little I/O capacity
    • Inefficient → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements]
    • Too many sessions requesting to change the same object (Concurrency and contention)
    • Bad database configuration

}
{ Tuning

  Tuning aims at improving response time, usually by increasing throughput.

}
{ Automatic Workload Repository

  One essential and indispensable treasure of information that is needed to tune a database is found in the  → development/databases/Oracle/Automatic-Workload-Repository[Automatic Workload Repository].

}
sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/Active-Session-History

  Declaring a PL/SQL function with the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/pragma/udf[`pragma udf`] might improve the function's response time.
