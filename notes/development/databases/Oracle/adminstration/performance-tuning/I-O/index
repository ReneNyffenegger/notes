$ Oracle: I/O
@ I/O

The two main factors that control how I/O is performed are:
  • Asynchronous I/O
  • Direct I/O

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache

  A → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server does not directly write to data files. Rather, it writes to the buffer cache and lets background processes do the I/O.
