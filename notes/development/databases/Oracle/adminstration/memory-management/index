$ Oracle memory management
@ memory management

*Memory management* deals with determining the optimal size for the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instance] memory structures of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA and
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA.

Oracle offers *automatic* and *manual* memory management.

With automatic memory management, the memory of the SGA and PGA are adjusted and fine tuned by Oracle. Two → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameters] are needed for automatic memory management:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#memory_target[`memory_target`]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#memory_max_target[`memory_max_target`] (which is even optional)


{ Init parameters related to memory management

  Init parameters that are related to memory management are:
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#inmemory_size[`inmemory_size`]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#memory_target[`memory_target`]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#memory_max_target[`memory_max_target`]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#memoptimize_pool_size[`memoptimize_pool_size`]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#pga_aggregate_limit[`pga_aggregate_limit`]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#pga_aggregate_target[`pga_aggregate_target`]

}
sa:
  Too little memory or ill allocated memory might lead to peformance problems, see → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/performance-tuning.
