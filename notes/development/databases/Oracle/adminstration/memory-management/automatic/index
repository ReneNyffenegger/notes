$ Oracle: Automatic Memory Management
@ automatic memory management

When *automatic memory management* (AMM) is enabled, Oracle will → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/memory-management[manage memory] for 
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA and instance → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA.
-
Oracle recommends this method over *manual* memory management (but only for databases where where → https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-memory.html#GUID-04EFED7D-D1F1-43C3-B78F-0FF9AFAC02B0[SGA + PGA <= 4GB]).

AMM (which was introduced in 11g) extends ASMM (= Automatic Shared Memory Management, which was introduced in 10g and manages the SGA only).

In order to enable automatic memory management, two → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameters] are needed to be set:
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target/max` (which is even optional)

When using AMM, it's still possible to set SGA memory size related parameters.
-
If none of these is set, MMAN initially assigns 60 % of memory to `sga_target` and 40 % of memory to `pga_aggregate_target` but will then adjust the values as MMAN sees fit.

? Current settings can be views in `v$memory_dynamic_components` and `v$memory_resize_ops`.


{ Automatic Shared Memory Management

  { Pools not affected by Automatic Shared Memory Management

    The following pools are not affected by automatic shared memory management:
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/redo-log-buffer[Log buffer]
      • Other buffer caches, such as *keep*, *recycle* and *other block sizes*
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/fixed[Fixed SGA] (including other internal allocations)

  }

}
sa:

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/memory/dynamic_components` shows the current sizes of all dynamically tuned memory components, including the total size of the SGA and the instance PGA.
 -
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga/dynamic_componentes` shows the same information except SGA and instance PGA.

  The functionality for Automatic Memory Management is provided by the MMAN (Memory Manager) background process.

  When AMM is enabled, the amount of `memory_target` is created with `→ Linux/fhs/dev/shm` segments (MOS Note 1392549.1):
code {
ls -l → Linux/fhs/dev/shm | grep $ORACLE_SID
code }
