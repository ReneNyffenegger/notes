When *automatic memory management* is enabled, Oracle will → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/memory-management[manage memory] for 
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA and instance → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA.

Oracle recommends this method over *manual* memory management.

In order to enable automatic memory management, two → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameters] are needed to be set:
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target`
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target/max` (which is even optional)

{ Automatic Shared Memory Management

  { Pools not affected by Automatic Shared Memory Management

    The following pools are not affected by automatic shared memory management:
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/redo-log-buffer[Log buffer]
      • Other buffer caches, such as *keep*, *recycle* and *other block sizes*
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/fixed[Fixed SGA] (including other internal allocations)

  }
