$ Oracle: SQL patch

An *SQL patch* is a patch that contains SQL scripts which need to be installed after OPatch completes.


sa:

  SQL patches that are used in the context of → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/patching#ora-opatch[OPatch] should not be confused with
  the patches (that also go by the name → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/SQL-Patch[SQL patches]) that are used to modify an SQL execution plan by injecting → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[hints] into an SQL statement.
