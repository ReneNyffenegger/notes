$ Oracle: recovery
@ recovery

The three types of recovery are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance
  • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/crash
  • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/media

The data necessary for recovery is the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data: when a database is recovered, all
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data/record[redo records] are applied.

Crash and instance recovery don't need manual intevention (other than starting the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance up again). Media recovery is more complicated: they need
a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup to be restored.
