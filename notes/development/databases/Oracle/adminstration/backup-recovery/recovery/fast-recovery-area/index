{ Location

  The fast recover area is located at one of the following
    • a database managed directory (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/managed)
    • a → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[filesystem]
    • an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk-group

   Raw disks are not supported.

   The location is sest with the
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#db_recovery_file_dest[`db_recovery_file_dest` init parameter]

}
{ Transient and permanent files

  A file in the *fast recovery area* is either *permanent* or *transient*.

  Files that are used by the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance are *permanent*. Those that are not used are *transient*.

  Transient files will be removed after they have become obsolete as per the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup/retention-policy.

}
{ Files that are stored in the fast recovery area

  
The *fast recovery area* is a location on disk where files can be stored that are needed for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery such as

{ Size of the fast recovery area

  The fast recovery area should be generously sized: the larger, the more useful it becomse (as is the case with everything, anyway).

  The fast recovery area should have enough room to store a copy of all
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database as well as its
  incremental backups.

  If available space is an issue, then at least the most important → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived log files] that are not yet saved on tape should be stored in the FRA.
