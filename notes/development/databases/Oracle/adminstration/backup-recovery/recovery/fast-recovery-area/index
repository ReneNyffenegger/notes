$ Oracle: fast recovery area
@ fast recovery area

{ Location

  The fast recover area is located at one of the following
    • a database managed directory (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/managed)
    • a → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[filesystem]
    • an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk-group

   Raw disks are not supported.

   The location is set with the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#db_recovery_file_dest[`db_recovery_file_dest` init parameter].

}
{ Transient and permanent files

  A file in the *fast recovery area* is either *permanent* or *transient*.

  Files that are used by the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance are *permanent*. Those that are not used are *transient*.

  Transient files will be removed after they have become obsolete as per the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup/retention-policy.

}
{ Files that are stored in the fast recovery area

  
The *fast recovery area* is a location on disk where files can be stored that are needed for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery such as
  table { ll
      ☰ Permanent?
   Multiplexed copies of the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control files] ☰ ✓
   → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo log] copies ☰ ✓
   → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived redo log files] ☰ ✗

   → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy[Image copies] of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control files] ☰ ✗

table }

}
{ Size of the fast recovery area

  The fast recovery area should be generously sized: the larger, the more useful it becomes (as is the case with everything, anyway).

  The fast recovery area should have enough room to store a copy of all
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database as well as its
  incremental backups.

  If available space is an issue, then at least the most important → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived log files] that are not yet saved on tape should be stored in the FRA.
  

  { Checking the space limit and the used space #ora-recovery-area-check-size

    The upper limit of the size of the fast recovery area and how much space is already used can be checked with the following query:
code {
select
    round(space_used /1024/1024/1024, 2) space_used_gb,
    round(space_limit/1024/1024/1024, 2) space_limit_gb
from
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/recovery/file/dest[v$recovery_file_dest];
code }

    Use `v$recovery_area_usage` to see how much space each file type (control file, redo log etc) uses

  }
  { ORA-19809: limit exceeded for recovery files

    This error message proposes 5 actions (solutions) to get rid of it: 
      • Take frequent backup of recovery area using → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN.
      • Consider changing RMAN → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup/retention-policy[retention policy].
      • Consider changing RMAN archived log deletion policy.
      • Add disk space and increase → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/index#db_recovery_file_dest_size[`DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE`].
      • Delete files from recovery area using RMAN.

    Deleting *expired archived log files* with RMAN:
code {
$ rman target /
RMAN> crosscheck archivelog all;
RMAN> delete expired archivelog all;
code }

    A more brute force way is to just delete *all* archived log files:
code {
RMAN> delete archivelog all;
RMAN> crosscheck archivelog all;
code }

  }

{ Misc

  The fast recovery area was formerly referred to as *flash recovery area*.
