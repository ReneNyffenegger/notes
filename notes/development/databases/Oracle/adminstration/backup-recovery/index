$ Oracle backup and recovery
@ backup and recovery

A backup needs to include all crucial parts of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database]:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/server-parameter-file
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control

{ Whole and partial database backup

  A *whole database backup* is a backup of
    • every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data file]
    • the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control

  Partial database backup only backs up a limited subset of the data such as
    • a set of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces]
    • a set of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files]

}
{ Consistent and inconsistent backups


  A *whole database backup* is either consistent or inconsistent.
  
  { Consistent backup

    In a *consistent* backup, all (read/write) → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control files] have
    the same *checkpoint SCN*. This guarantees that the files contain all changes up to this SCN.

    A consistent backup can only be taken after a consistent shutdown.

    After *restoring* a consistent backup, *recovery* is not required.

    Databases running in *noarchivelog* mode can only be (securly) backed up in a consistent fashion because they need recovery after restoration and recovery is only possible with archived redo log files.


  }

}
{ Image copies and backup sets

  An image copy is an exact copy of data files, control files and archived redo log files.

  A backup set is a backup in a propriety format.

  Image copies can be created with either → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN or operating system utilities. Backup set can only be created with RMAN.

}
{ Data file recovery

  Data file recovery repairs a lost or damaged current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data file] or
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control file].
  -
  It can also recover lost data changes after a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace went offline without the `offline normal` option.

  In order to perform data file media recovery,
    • the data file must be offline, or
    • the database is not open


}
{ Instance recovery

  Instance recovery automatically applies changes to online files

}
{ Tools available for backup and recovery

  Some tools that are needed for backup and recovery are
    • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN
    • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/Enterprise-Manager/Cloud-Control
    • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/Recovery-Appliance

  It is also possible, but probably very cumbersome, to devise a solution that does backup and recovery with an array of
  shell scripts and development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/recover[SQL*Plus `recover`] commands.

  The preferred solution for backup and recovery is → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN.

}
{ Complete and incomplete recovery

  { Complete recovery

    Complete recovery applies *all* redo log changes of archived log files and the online redo logs to a backup.

    Compleate recovery is usually performed after a *media failure*.

    Complete recovery is possible on
      • databases
      • tablespaces
      • data files

  }
  { Incomplete recovery

    An incomplete recovery only applies a part of the available redo log.

    An imcomplete recovery is usually performed after a *human error*.

    In order to perform an incomplete recovery, a backup must be found that is older than the time to which the recovery is intended to be done. Then, the database needs to
    opened with the `resetlogs` option (to reset the logs which creates a new stream of log sequence numbers starting with 1).
    
    Incomplete recovery is also referred to as *database point in time recovery* (DBPITR). → development/databases/Oracle/Features_Options_Management-Packs/Flashback[Flashback Database] might be an alternative to DBPITR
    if current data files are available.

{ Data Recovery Advisor

  The *Data Recovery Advisor*
    • diagnoses data failures,
    • presents repair options and
    • carries out and verifies repairs

}
{ Alternatives to RMAN

  Some (limited) alternatives to RMAN are
    • → Linux/shell/commands/dd[`dd`]
    • The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus command → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/recover[`recover`]
