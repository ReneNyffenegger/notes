$ Oracle resource management
@ resource management

The more development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[users] and sessions are connected to a development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance, the more important the management of the resources offered by the instance becomes crucial.
*Resource management* deals with assigning the available resources to user accounts, applications and services. A session that consumes too much resources can be slowed down or trimmed back so that other sessions are less impacted by
a bottleneck of resources.

Oracle provides → development/databases/DBA[DBAs] with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/resource_manager[`dbms_resource_manager`] to administrate resource allocation. For example, it's possible to
assign more percent of the available CPU time to → development/Data/OLTP processes than to → development/Data/OLAP processes because OLTP is usually more time critical.
