$ Oracle Event 10397: suppress verbose parallel coordinator error reporting
@ 10397

The 10397 event prevents the → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-12801_error-signaled-in-parallel-query-server error to be put on top of the error stack which can be useful if a frontend only
shows the top Oracle error (which in case of ORA-12801 is quite meaningless).

code {
create table tq84_ora_12801 (n varchar2(50));
insert into tq84_ora_12801 select level from dual connect by level <= 1e6;
-- This is not a zero but the uppercase letter O!
insert into tq84_ora_12801 values ('O');
commit;
 
select /*+ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/parallel */ max(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to/number(n)) from tq84_ora_12801;
-- → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-12801_error-signaled-in-parallel-query-server[ORA-12801: error signaled in parallel query server P005]
-- → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01722_invalid-number

code }
