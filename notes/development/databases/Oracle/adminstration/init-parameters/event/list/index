$ List of possible(?) values for the Oracle parameter EVENT

Purposes of an events include
  • Get additional diagnostics
  • Change the behavior of the Oracle server (10235)
  • Eabling undocumented features or enabling workaround for known problems
  • Enable collection of trace or debug information (10046, 10053)
  • Enable additional error checking
  • Immediate dump events (→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/dump/systemstate[`systemstate`], → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/dump/pga_detail_get[`pga_detail_get`])
  • Dump «something» when a given error (`ORA-…`) occurs.

When setting events in the init.ora file, they should be grouped together on subsequent lines, otherwise, only the last event will found will have an effect.
code {
event="ddddd trace name context forever, level …"
event="eeeee trace name context forever, level …"
event="fffff trace name context forever, level …"
code }

{ Finding event names with ORADEBUG

  It's possible to find event names with → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug:
code {
SQL> oradebug → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/doc/event/name[doc event name]
code }

}
{ Useful events

  Some useful events include
    • 10013
    • 10015
    • 10032
    • 10046
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list/10051
    • 10053
    • 10079
    • 10132
    • 10231
    • 10235

{ Finding event descriptions with SQLERRM

→ http://www.juliandyke.com/Diagnostics/Events/Events.php[Julian Dyke] mentions that the possible values for the  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event[`event`] parameter
are related to → development/databases/Oracle/errors[SQL error messages](!) in the range of 10000 through 10999 (Compare with `select event from x$trace_events`).
-
For example, the error → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00600_internal-error-code[ORA-00600] triggers an errorstack trace.

Thus, a list of possible events can be generated with the following
anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block]:
code {
declare 
   msg varchar2(256);
begin
   for num in 10000..10999 loop

     msg := → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[sqlerrm](-num);

     if msg not like '%Message ' || num || ' not found%' then
        dbms_output.put_line (num || ': ' || substr(msg, 11));
     end if;

   end loop;
end;

code }
