$ List of possible(?) values for the Oracle parameter EVENT

{ Finding event names with ORADEBUG

  It's possible to find event names with → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug:
code {
SQL> oradebug → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/doc/event/name[doc event name]
code }

}
{ Finding event descriptions with SQLERRM


→ http://www.juliandyke.com/Diagnostics/Events/Events.php[Julian Dyke] mentions that the possible values for the  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event[`event`] parameter
are related to → development/databases/Oracle/errors[SQL error messages](!) in the range of 10000 through 10999 (Compare with `select event from x$trace_events`).
Thus, a list of possible events can be generated with the following
anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block]:
code {
declare 
   msg varchar2(256);
begin
   for num in 10000..10999 loop

     msg := → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[sqlerrm](-num);

     if msg not like '%Message ' || num || ' not found%' then
        dbms_output.put_line (num || ': ' || substr(msg, 11));
     end if;

   end loop;
end;
