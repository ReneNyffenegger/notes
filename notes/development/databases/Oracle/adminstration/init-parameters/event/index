$ Oracle: init parameter EVENT
-
@ event


{ Numeric events

Format:
code {
NNNNN trace name context forever, level L
code }
`NNNNN` and `L` are numbers.

Multiple events can be separated by a colon:
code {
alter system set event='10325 trace name context forever, level 10:10015 trace name context forever, level 1' scope=spfile;
code }

}
{ Named events

  Named events have a different format.

code {
alter session set events 'immediate trace name controlf level 2' ;
alter system  set events '942 trace name errorstack level 3';
code }

  Note the plural `events` vs the singular `event` and the missing `,` before the `level`.

}

{ Remove all events

code {
alter system reset event scope=spfile sid='*' ;
code }

  The asterisk (`*`) does not work for → development/databases/Oracle/Options/real-application-clusters[RACs], instead, the *instance name* is required.

}
{ TODO

  ? Oracle uses `ksdpec()` to check if aspecific event is turned on for tracing (*if* at least one event is set).

  ? `ss_wrtf()` seems to be related to writing trace files.
