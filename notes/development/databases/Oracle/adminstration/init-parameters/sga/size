$ Oracle: Init parameters SGA_MAX_SIZE and SGA_MIN_SIZE

The value of `sga_max_size` specifies the maximum size for the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA for the lifetime of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance.

? When Oracle starts up, it reserves («allocates») as much *virtual* (not physical) memory as specified with `sga_max_size` in order to make sure this amount of memory can be provided
to processes that need memory.
-
? If the size of `sga_max_size` is larger than the sum of configured size for SGA components, the remaining memory is found/seen in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA#ora-variable-sga[variable SGA].

The default value of `sga_max_size` depends on the values of `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target/max`.

`sga_max_size` should not be set if `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target` is set.

{ TODO

  Are the following two numbers not equal because `sum(value) from v$sga` is not rounded up to a granule size? (See MOS note 266702.1)
code {
select to_number(value) from v$parameter where name = 'sga_max_size' union all
select sum(value) from v$sga;
code }

}
