$ Oracle: Init parameter MEMORY_TARGET
@ memory_target

Setting `memory_target` lets → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/memory-management/automatic[Oracle manage memory automatically].

The value of `memory_target` specifies the maximum size of memory used by Oracle for *→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA and PGA*.
-
The *total* amount of memory used can exceed the specified value, for example for memory allocated for PL/SQL tables and varrays. Memory used for such purposes is allocated
as long as there is memory available from the operating system.

The value of `memory_target` controls, together with `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target/max`, the default value of `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/sga/size[`sga_max_size`].
-
If `memory_target` is set, `sga_max_size` should not be set (because that would fix the size of the SGA and conflicts with the intended use of `memory_target`).
