$ Oracle: Init parameter MEMORY_MAX_TARGET
@ memory_max_target

The value of `memory_max_target` is equal to `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target` if `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target` is set but `memory_max_target` is not.

When the instance starts up, MMAN locks (reserves) the amount of memory specified by `memory_max_target` so that `memory_target` can be increased up to the value of `memory_max_target`.

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters such as `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/memory/target`.
