$ Oracle: Init parameter PARALLEL_THREADS_PER_CPU
@ parallel_threads_per_cpu

? The value of `parallel_threads_per_cpu` should be incresed in systems where the I/O subystem is too slow and essentially leaves the CPUs in an idle state for most of the time.

The default value changed from 2 before Release 12.2 to 1 in Release 18.

The value of `parallel_threads_per_cpu` influences the default value of other → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parallel[parallel execution] parameters such as `parallel_max_servers`.
