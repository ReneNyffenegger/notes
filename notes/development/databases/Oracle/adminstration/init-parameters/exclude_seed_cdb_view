$ Oracle: Init parameter _EXCLUDE_SEED_CDB_VIEW
@ _exclude_seed_cdb_view

If `_exclude_seed_cdb_view` is set to `true` (which is the default), everything releated to `PDB$SEED` is hidden in queries related to multitenant containers.

{ Example

  When connected to a container root, the data files for `pdb$seed` are not shown in using the following query:
code {
select *
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/data_files[cdb_data_files];
code }

  However, when setting `_exclude_seed_cdb_view` to `false`, the `pdb$seed` data files are included in the previous query:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session/set/init-param[alter session set] "_exclude_seed_cdb_view" = true;
code }

  It's probably good practice to revert this change after having seen the relevant information:  
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session/set/init-param[alter session set] "_exclude_seed_cdb_view" = false;
code }

  It's also possible to view the data files of `pdb$seed` by setting the current container to `pdb$seed`.
code {
alter session set container = pdb$seed;
code }

However, *only* this container's data files are now shown in `cdb_data_files`.

  Going back to the original container:
code {
alter session set container = cdb$root;
code }

}
