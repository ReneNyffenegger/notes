$ Oracle: Init parameter PLSCOPE_SETTINGS
@ plscope_settings

`plscope_settings` controls → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/PL-Scope settings: compile time collection, cross reference, and storage of PL/SQL source code identifier and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement data.

{ Possible values

  table { ll
    `identifiers:all` ☰
    `identifiers:none` ☰
    `identifiers:public` ☰
    `identifiers:sql` ☰
    `identifiers:plsql` ☰
    `statements:all` ☰
    `statements:none` ☰
  table }

  The setting for `identifiers` and `statements` can be combined:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session/set/init-param[alter session set] plscope_settings = 'identifiers:all, statements:all';
code }

}
{ Show current plscope values for PL/SQL objects

  The value of `plscope_settings` with which a PL/SQL object was compiled can be queried from
  `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/plsql/object_settings[dba_plsql_object_settings]`.

code {
select
   owner,
   name,
   type,
   plscope_settings
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/plsql/object_settings[dba_plsql_object_settings]
where
   owner in (select username from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/users[dba_users] where oracle_maintained = 'N')
order by
   owner,
   name,
   type;
code }

}
{ Modify PLSCOPE settings for all PL/SQL objects of a given schema

code {
alter session set plscope_settings = 'identifiers:all, statements:all';

   for p in (
      select

      where
         owner = user and
         object_type in ('PACKAGE', 'PROCEDURE', 'FUNCTION', 'TYPE')
   ) loop

     begin
        execute immediate 'alter ' || p.object_type || ' ' || p.owner || '.' || p.object_name || ' compile';

     exception when others then

           dbms_output.put_line('Ok with error: ' || p.object_type || ' ' || p.object_name);
        end if;
     end;

   end loop;
