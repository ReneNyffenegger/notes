$ Oracle: Init parameter MAX_IDLE_BLOCKER_TIME
@ max_idle_blocker_time

The value of `max_idle_blocker_time` specifies the number of minutes that a blocking → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session can remain idle until it is → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session#ora-session-terminate[terminated].

After expiration of the specified time, the blocking session receives error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-03113_end-of-file-on-communication-channel.

Obviously, `max_idle_blocker_time` has no effect if its value is larger than that of `max_idle_time`.
