$ Oracle: Init parameter FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS
@ filesystemio_options

`filesystem_options` controls whether Oracle files are accessed with *asynchronous → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/performance-tuning/I-O* and/or *direct → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/performance-tuning/I-O*.

The value of `filesystem_options` can be set to
table { ll
  `none` ☰ Synchronous and buffered I/O
  `setall` ☰ Asynchronous and direct I/O
  `directIO` ☰ Synchronous and direct I/O
  `async` ☰ Asynchronous and buffered I/O
table }

Obviously, asynchronous I/O and/or direct I/O will only be used if it's available (regardless of the setting of this init parameter).
-
Asynchronous I/O can also be disabled by setting `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/disk/async_io`) to `false`.

Because ASM bypasses the filesystem layer, `filesystem_options` has no effect when ASM is used.
