$ Oracle: NLS_DATE_FORMAT
@ nls_date_format

The value of `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/nls/format/date` is used as default date format in
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to/char[`to_char`] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to_date[`to_date`].

If not explicitly defined, the value for `nls_date_format` is defined by `nls_territory`, not by `nls_date_language`.

The value can be set to a combination of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/format-models#ora-fmt-date[date format elements].

{ Influence of NLS_DATE_FORMAT to selecting records #nls_date_format-where

  The following example tries to demonstrate how the value of `nls_date_format` influences a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/where` condition.

  Save current value of `nls_date_format` so we can restore it later.
code {
select sys_context('userenv', 'nls_date_format') from dual;
code }

  Change value of `nls_date_format`:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session/set/init-param[alter session set] nls_date_format = 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss';
code }

  Alternatively, use `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/session/set_nls` (but this doesn't seem to work in
→ development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer]:
code {
begin
   dbms_session.set_nls('nls_date_format', '"yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss"');
end;
/
code }

  Verify value was changed:
code {
select value from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter where name = 'nls_date_format';
code }

  Select a few `created` values from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects`. They're returned in the specified format:
code {
select
   owner,
   object_name,
   object_type,
   created
from
   dba_objects;
code }

  Pick one of the selected values and select all objects that were created in the given second:
code {
select * from dba_objects where created = '2023-03-26 02:26:30';
code }

  Change date format:
code {
alter session set nls_date_format = 'yyyy-mm-dd';
code }

  Try the same query. It throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01830_date-format-ends-before-converting-entire-input-string.
code {
select * from dba_objects where created = '2023-03-26 02:26:30';
code }

  One might be tempted to change the `where` condition. But this query doesn't (very likely) find anything, as the string `2023-03-26` is exactly midnight:
code {
select * from dba_objects where created = '2023-03-26';
code }

  Using `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to_date` to make sure we're independent from the date format. This query will return some records:
code {
select * from dba_objects where created = to_date('2023-03-26 02:26:30', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss');
code }

  Possibly a more lightweight solution to select records using the `timestamp` literal:
code {
select * from dba_objects where created = timestamp '2023-03-26 02:26:30';
code }

}
