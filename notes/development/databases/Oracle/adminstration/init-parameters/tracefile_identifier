$ Oracle: init parameter TRACEFILE_IDENTIFIER
@ tracefile_identifier

If the value of `tracefile_identifier` was changed with an `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session#ora-alter-session-set[alter session set] tracefile_identifier = '…'` statement, the value is then
found in the column → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/process#vProcess-traceid[`traceid`] in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/process[`v$process`].

The value of `tracefile_identifier` also facilitates finding a particular process' → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[trace file]:

select value from v$diag_info where name = 'Default Trace File';

from

{ Bug when setting TRACEFILE_IDENTIFIER

  Cary Millsap describes a → https://github.com/CaryMillsap/tracing-oracle/blob/main/code/bugs/tracefile_identifier/bug.sql[bug related to setting `tracefile_identifier`]:
  "
   When you set TRACEFILE_IDENTIFIER, the Oracle kernel process closes the
   existing trace file and opens a new one. The new file doesn't contain all of
   the information that it should. Specifically, it will not contain
   some "PARSING IN CURSOR" sections that have been written to the first of the two
   trace files. Impact is that, when we look at the trace file whose name has
   the new tracefile identifier in it, we can't determine the SQL or PL/SQL
   associated with all the cursors reported on in the trace. The workaround is
   to simply never use TRACEFILE_IDENTIFIER. This has been a problem since at
   least Oracle 10g, and it's still reproducible in → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c FREE.
