$ Oracle: Init parameter DB_BLOCK_CHECKSUM
@ db_block_checksum


`db_block_checksum` controls whether → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/DBWn[DBWn] and the direct loader will calculate checksums for 
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data blocks] and store them in the data blocks' cache header when writing the blocks to disk.

The value of `db_block_checksum` also determines if checksums are calculated for → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log/block[redo log blocks].

If the value of the parameter is set to `FULL` and the checksum validation fails, Oracle tries to recover the block by reading it from disk or from another instance and then
applying redo.

Corruptions are signaled with → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00600_internal-error-code or ORA-01578.

The value of `db_block_checksum` is dependent on `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/ultra_safe`.
