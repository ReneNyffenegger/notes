$ Oracle: Init parameter DB_CACHE_ADVICE
@ db_cache_advice

The value of `db_cache_advice` can be set to either of
table { lll
  `on` ☰ ☰ This is the default if `statistics_level` is `typical` or `all`
  `ready` ☰ The advisory is turned off but the memory is allocated (so `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/db/cache_advice` can still be quried) ☰
  `off` ☰ ☰ This is the default if `statistics_level` is `basic`
table }

sa:

  Setting `db_cache_advice` to `on` is a prerequisite for `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga/target_advice` to be populated (the other one is to set `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/statistics_level` to at least `typical`).
