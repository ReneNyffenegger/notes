$ Oracle Scheduler
@ scheduler

The scheduler is used schedule jobs and tasks.

Scheduler objects are standard → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Oracle objects]. Thus, their usage can be granted and revoked.

{ Scheduler objects

  { Job

    A *job* stores the information needed to run the task that the job describes. This information includes
      • the action (what is to be executed)
      • when and periodicity of the execution of the action
      • where the action is executed (see *destination* below)
      • the credentials (see below) with which the job is executed

    A job has an owner: the schema in which it was created.

  }
  { Job Class

    A *job class* groups a set of jobs so that the can be administered simulataneously.

  }
  { Program

    A *program* describes what is to be run by the scheduler. Information that pertains to a program include
      • action
      • type
      • number of arguments.

    A program is run by a job

  }
  { Schedule

    A *schedule* specifies when and how many times a job is run.

  }
  { Window

    A *window* defines a period of time during which jobs can automatically be started.

  }
  { Window group
  
    …

  }
  { Chains

    A *chain* is a scheduler object with which *dependent scheduling* is possible:
    Jobs are started depending on the outcomes of one or more other jobs, according to *dependency rules*.

    These dependency rules define the conditions (such as success, failure or completion-code)
    that can be used to start or stop a step or the chain itself.

  }
  { Credential

    A *credential* is a scheduler object that stores a user name and associated → development/security/password[password].

    A credential is needed by a job to authenticate itself with the Oracle database or the operating system.

  }
  { Destination

    A *destination* corresponds to a location where a job is run.

    There are two types of destinations:
      • Database destinations, and
      • External destinations

  }
  { Destination Group

    A *destination group* is a scheduler object that contains a list of *scheduler destination objects*.

  }
  { File Watcher

    A *file watcher* is a scheduler object that triggers the Scheduler to start a job when a file with a given name and location «arrives».
