Predefined automated maintenance tasks
  • Statisics collection
  • Optimizer statistics advisor
  • Segment advisor
  • SQL tuning advisor
  • SQL Plan management (SPM) evolve advisor

Maintanance tasks can be enabled or disabled with `dbms_auto_task_admin`

Automated maintenance task job names begin with `ORA$AT` (this constant is used as `where` condition in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/autotask/job_history`)
-
See also `select * from dba_scheduler_window_groups where window_group_name like 'ORA$AT%'` and `select * from dba_scheduler_groups where group_name like 'ORA$AT%'`.

The default job class for autotasks is `ora$autotask_job_class`.

{ Predefined maintenance windows

  By default, there are seven predefined maintance windows, one for each day of the week.
  -
  The duration of `SATURDAY_WINDOW` and `SUNDAY_WINDOW` is longer than that of the other windows.

  The predefined maintainance windows can be adjusted with `dbms_scheduler.set_attribute`.

  By default, all predefined maintenance windows use the resource plan
 `DEFAULT_MAINTENANCE_PLAN`, but any resource plan can be assigned to any maintanance window by
  including the subplan `ORA$AUTOTASK` in the new plan.

  Automated maintenance tasks run under its subplan
 `ORA$AUTOTASK`. This subplan divides its portion of total resource allocation equally among the maintenance tasks.
