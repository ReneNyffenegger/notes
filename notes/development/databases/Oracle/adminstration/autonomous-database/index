{ Claims

  Oracle claims to be the world's first vendor to deliver an autonomous → development/databases[database].

{ Some features

 ~Replay production workload~ on a test database to make sure that an upgrade does not have unexpected side effects on the production DB.

 ~Load and go~ architecture: database tunes itself and creates or drops indexes.

 ~Security patches~ are automatically applied every quarter. Patches for *zero day exploits* are applied off-cycle.

 ~Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing~ allows to run mission-critical enterprise applications, including mixed workloads and real-time analytics.
