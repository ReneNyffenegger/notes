$ Oracle Hybrid Columnar Compression
@ HCC

{ Required platforms

  HCC needs a supported Oracle platform such as → development/databases/Oracle/Exadata, SuperCluster, ZFS Storage Appliance or FS Flash Storage System.

}
{ Best use of HCC

  HCC is useful if data is *bulk loaded* and then queried (with little or no → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML after bulk loading the data).
  -
  Bulk loads are often found in dataware houses: inserts with `/*+ append */` hint, parallel dml,
  direct path → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader[SQL*LDR], `create table as select` statements.
  
  HCC should also be used for relational data, not for unstructred LOBs.

}
{ Compression Units (CU)

  In HCC, table data is split into *compression units* that are larger than database blocks.

  Within a CU, data is laid out in columns rather than by rows.

}
{ SQL - Create table

code {
create table ... ( columns) COMPRESS FOR QUERY   LOW ;
create table ... ( columns) COMPRESS FOR QUERY   HIGH;
create table ... ( columns) COMPRESS FOR ARCHIVE LOW ;
create table ... ( columns) COMPRESS FOR ARCHIVE HIGH;
code }

}

{ LONG data type

  The LONG data type is not suppored for HCC.
