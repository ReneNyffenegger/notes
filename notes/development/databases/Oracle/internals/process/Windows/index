$ Oracle internals: process (Windows)

On Windows, an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[Oracle process] is implemented as a → Windows/development/process/thread.
With Microsoft's → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/Debuggers/arch/cdb_exe[Symbolic Debugger for Windows (`cdb.exe`)], it's possible to show the
relationship between the «processes» as exposed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/process[`v$process`] and the actual Windows threads.

First, the available processes must be selected from `v$process`. Then `cdb.exe` must be started and attached to Oracle:
code {
C:\> cdb -pn oracle.exe
code }

After starting the debugger, all threads of the debuggee can be displayed with the → Windows/development/Debugging/tools/commands/tilde[tilde (`~`)].

It turns out that the thread IDs are related to the value `sosid` in `v$process`:
