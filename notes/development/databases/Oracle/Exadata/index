  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter] `_exadata_feature_on` seems to allow to test some Exadata features on non-productive environments. Setting
  this parameter on a productive environment breaks the license agreement.

code {
alter system set "_exadata_feature_on"=true scope=spfile;
shutdown immediate;
startup;
code }

}
