SQLcl is a new Java-based command-line interface for Oracle Database. It supports everything that already → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus[SQL*Plus] had, but comes also with
  • SQL history
  • Code assistance (pressing `tab` completes table, view and column names)
  • New commands such as `cd`,`ctas`, `ddl`, `repeat`
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl/script[Scripting] with → development/languages/JavaScript.

{ Only JRE required

  SQLcl only needs a JRE.

  Apparently, it can be very picky if it doesn't find the version it expects.

{ Download

? The download file is less than 20 MB.

  → http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/downloads/index.html[Download].

}
{ Scripting

  SQLcl (as well as → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer]) comes with → development/languages/JavaScript based → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl/script[scripting].
  
  A script is started with the keyword `script` and ended (like also an anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL block) with a slash (`/`)

  { Write some text

   `ctx.write` prints text. The new line `"\n"` is necessary for the text to be flushed:
code {
script
ctx.write("hello world\n");
/
code }

    Text can also be written with `print(…)` in which case the new line is not required.
code {
script
print('The number is 42');
/
code }

  `print()` writes to a different output stream than `ctx.write()`. It seems that when using such scripts in → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer], the stream that `print()` writes to
   cannot be captured (that is: if it is possible, I don't know how).

  } 
  { Executing stored scripts

`script` can also execute the content of a  script file. The file's suffix `.js` can be ommited:
code {
script some_file_with_javascript
code }

  }
  { Run dynamic SQL statements

    It is possible to create a dynamic → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement] and then have it executed with `sqlcl.setStmt(…)` and `sqlcl.run()`:
code {
script
var tabName = 'all_users';
sqlcl.setStmt('select count(*) from ' + tabName);
sqlcl.run();
/
code }

  }

}
{ SQLcl not showing error messages

  SQLcl does not automatically show error messages. (As per → https://ogobrecht.github.io/posts/2020-01-02-why-i-like-sqlplus-for-deployment-scripts[Ottmar Gobrecht's Blog], this problem only occurs in
  versions prior to 19.4 or on Windows).

code {
rene@SYS$USERS> create or replace procedure drop_me as
  2  begin
  3     no_such_procedure;
  4  end;
  5  /
code }

  No error message shown, although `no_such_procedure` does not exist.

code {
rene@SYS$USERS> show errors

Errors for PROCEDURE RENE.DROP_ME:

LINE/COL ERROR
-------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
3/4      PL/SQL: Statement ignored
3/4      → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/errors-warnings/PLS-00201_identifier_must-be-declared[PLS-00201: identifier 'NO_SUCH_PROCEDURE' must be declared]
code }

  Ottmar Gobrecht proposes to use the following setings until a fix is released
code {
set define off verify off feedback on
code }

  With these settings, the errors are now displayed.

{ Starting sqlcl / Command line options

  sqlcl is started by using its name `sql`.

  sqlcl has the following command line options:
  { -H

    Display SQLcl version (as `-V` does) and usage help.

  }
  { -V

    Display SQLcl version

  }
  { -R level

    Set restricted level. Level = 1, 2, 3 or 4, 4 being the most restrictve.

    The restriction level determines how much a use can mess up the file system.

  }
  { -S
  
     Silent mode: no output of SQLcl banner, prompts and commands.

  }
  { -verbose

    Show logging messages inline.

  }
  { -nohistory

    No history logging.

  }
  { -noupdates

     No check if update is availab.e
  
  }
  { -oci

    By default, SQLcl uses Oracle's JDBC driver to connect to the database.
    -
    With `-oci`, it is instructed to use the Oracle client.
  }
  { -L
  
    Don't reprompt for username/password if entered wrongly.

  }

}
{ Misc

  { alias

    sqlcl can create aliases:
code {
rene@ORA19> alias usr=select username, account_status, default_tablespace from dba_users;
code }

   The command that such aliases is set to are then executed by simply entering the name of the alias:
code {
rene@ORA19> usr
code }

    When running sqlcl under → Windows, the aliases are stored in `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming[%APPDATA]\sqlcl\aliases.xml` and thus can be reused when quitting and starting an
    sqlcl session.

  }
  { ddl / ctas

    Use `dbms_metadata` to get a table's create statement or to produce a `create table as select…` statement.

  }
  { info / info+

    `info` and `info+` describe tables and views

  { SQL Select hints #sqlcl-sqldev-select-hints

  SQLcl and → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer] allow to specify *SQL select hints* which cause a result set to be returned in a specific format:
code {
select /*ansiconsole*/ * from …; -- Best appearance for ANSI terminal display
select /*csv*/         * from …; -- → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV[Comma-separated values]
select /*delimited*/   * from …; -- same as csv
select /*fixed*/       * from …; -- Fixed-width fields with trailing blanks
select /*html*/        * from …; -- Marked-up → development/web/HTML table
select /*insert*/      * from …; -- Return INSERT statements
select /*json*/        * from …; -- Returns → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON object format
select /*loader*/      * from …; -- Pipe-delimited format suitable for → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader[SQL*Loader]
select /*text*/        * from …; -- Plain text
select /*xml*/         * from …; -- Tagged → development/XML
code }

  Note: these hints are not to be confused with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[Oracle Optimizer hints].

  In → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer], such a select statement needs to be executed with `F5` for the «hint» to have an effect.

   TODO: Compare with → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/SQL-extensions.

  { Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform


    Apparently, `ocijdbc19.dll` is 64-bit while SQLcl (`sql.exe`) is 32-bit. This causes the error message
   *→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin/ocijdbcvv_dll[C:\Oracle\19\bin\ocijdbc19.dll]: Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform*
    
   *Why* on Earth does SQLcl sometimes try to use OCI? And *why* is the executable a 32-bit executable?

   *Ok*…, it seems that I *can* connect with the thin driver if I use the corresponding connection string:
code {
.\sql.exe rene/rene@jdbc:oracle:thin:@192.168.0.227:1521:ORA19
code }

   If this is how this is supposed to be? Who knows?
