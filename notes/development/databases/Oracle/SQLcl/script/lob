$ SQLcl: put a BLOB into an Oracle table and get it again

This example tries to demonstrate how
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[BLOBs] can be written and read into/from an
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[oracle table] with → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl/script[SQLcl scripting].

The example was inspired by → http://krisrice.io[Kris Rice's] example on → http://krisrice.io/2015-10-15-sqlcl-blob-loading-all-files/[SQLCL - Blob loading ALL the files].

In order to understand the mechanisms behind the code a bit better, I slightly rewrote the code.

{ create-table.js

  First, we need a table into which the BLOB is going to be written. If the table already exists, it will be deleted so as to start cleanly.

  gh|about-SQLcl|/script/lob/create-table.js||

  With → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl, the script is started like so:
code {
rene@ORA19> script create-jab.js
code }

}
{ put-image.js

 `put-image.js` loads the content of an file with an image (png) from the local file system and inserts it as → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[BLOB] into a new record in the table we have created:
  gh|about-SQLcl|/script/lob/put-image.js||

}
{ get-image.js

  With the image now in the database, we can get it again and save it locally:
  gh|about-SQLcl|/script/lob/get-image.js||

}
