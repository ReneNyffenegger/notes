$ Oracle: Flashback Database
@ Flashback Database

The effects of *Flashback Database* are somewhat similar to that of a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/point-in-time, however, it is usually faster because it does not need
  • to restore → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] from a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup
  • requires less redo than → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/media

*Flashback Database* needs → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area/flashback-logs to be able to go back in time.
