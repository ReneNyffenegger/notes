$ Oracle Flashback Technology

*Oracle Flashback Technology* allows to view past states of → development/Data and winding data back and forth in time, without the need to → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery[restore backups]
or → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/point-in-time

Flashback is *extremely* helpful if someone accidentally dropped a table.

With Oracle Flashback Technology, the following two functionalities are possible:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Features_Options_Management-Packs/Flashback/Logical-Features
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Features_Options_Management-Packs/Flashback/Database

There are 4 (5?) flashback related features (or options? or management packs?):
  • Flashback Table
  • Flashback Database
  • Flashback Transaction
  • Flashback Transaction Query
  • ? Optimization for Flashback Data Archive

{ Flashback Database

  An entire → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database can be rewound to a previous point in time. This might be helpful to correct user errors.

  Flashback Database might also be used to complement
    • → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Data-Guard
    • Data Recovery Advisor
    • Synchronizing cloned databases
