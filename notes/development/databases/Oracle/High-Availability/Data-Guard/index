Used for
  • High availability
  • Data protection
  • Disaster recovery
  • Primary database workload reduction

{ Database roles
  
  In a data guard environment, *one* database is a primary database, the others are standby databases. These roles are mutually exclusive.

  The role of a database can be queried in the column `database_role` in
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database.

  See also → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Data-Guard#dg-change-db-role[changing roles].

}
{ Primary database #dg-primary-db

  The primary db is the »real« production database.

  The primary db must run in *archivelog mode* and with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/alter/database#force-logging[forced logging].

}
{ Standby databases #dg-standby-db

  Standby databases are (transactionally consistent) copies of the primary database.

  Up to 30 standby databases are supported.


  { Physical and logical standby databases

    A standby DB is either *physical* or *logical* standby database. (A standby database can also become a *snapshot standby database*).

    A physical database is an exact byte-wise copy of the primary database.

    A logical database has the same data as the primary database, but is not necessarily stored in the same db blocks.

    The physical database is kept synchronized with *→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/redo-log-files[redo] apply*, the logical database with *SQL apply*.

  }
  { Cascading standby database

    A physical standby database might be configured to receive redo from a primary database and relay it to a another standby database.

    In this case, the relaying database is (also) called a *cascading standby database*. The receiveing standby databases is also known as a *terminal destination*.

    With such a configuration, the load on the primary database can be reduced.

  }
  { SQL*Plus

    Some → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus statements come with the `standby` keyword which indicates that the statement should be applied on the standby databases.

  }

}
{ Role of redo

  Data Guard basically works as follows:
    • Archived redo log files from the production DB are copied to the standby DB.
    • They are then registered with the standby DB.
    • Finally, using *media recovery*, the redo is used to roll forward the standby database.

}
{ Preventing physical errors

  A standby database validates the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/redo-log-files[redo] it receives from the primary DB.
  -
  Thus, physical errors (such as data corruption) on the primary DB are not propagated to standby databases.

}
{ Changing roles of databases #dg-change-db-role

  The role (primary vs standby) of a database can be changed by either a
    • switchover or
    • a failover

  A ~switchover~ is a planned → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Data-Guard/role-transition[role transition]. In a switchover, the primary database becomes a standby database while (one of) the standby databases becomes the primary database.
  -
  A switchover is performed in two steps: 1) the primary DB becomes a standby DB 2) a standby DB becomes a primary DB.

  A ~failover~ occurs when the primary database becomes unavailable. In this case, one of the standby databases becomes the new primary database.

}
{ RAC

  The primary db and the standby databases can be run as single instance or *real application clusters* (RAC).

}
{ Active Data Guard

  *Active data guard* offers the same features as *data guard* ~plus~ that it standby databases are opened read only *while* the copying of data takes place
  -
  Thus, it allows to query the standby databases without impacting the performance of the production database (for example to create resource-intensive reports).

  The standbase database is called *phsyical standby database*.
  -
  The buzzword is *real time query*.

  Active data guard must be licenced seperatly.

}
{ Data protection modes

  Data Guard runs in one of three data protection modes. This allows to balance data availability against system performance requirements.

  These protection modes are:
   • Maximum performance (default)
   • Maximum availability
   • Maximum performance

{ Configuration

  Each primary and standby database needs its own → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/control-file.
