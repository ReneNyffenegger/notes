$ Oracle Application Express
@ APEX

APEX  is a declarative, rapid web application development tool for the Oracle database.

APEx is a no cost → development/databases/Oracle/Options[option].

Requirements
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA at least 300 MB.
  • Oracle database release 11.2.0.4 or higher
  • → development/languages/JavaScript enabled → development/web/browser[browsers]
  • Access to a web listener (preferably *Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)* because both *Embedded PL/SQL Gateway* and *Oracle HTTP Server and mod_plsql* are deprecated.
  • Oracle XML DB must be installed for *full development environment* (not for runtime only installations)

The four primary user roles are
table { ll
  Instance adminstrators ☰ the Superusers
  Worskspace adminsitrators ☰ perform task that are specific to a workspace
  Developers ☰ create applications
  Users ☰ consume the applications
table }

{ Web server

  APEX offers its functionality over a web server, for example over → development/databases/Oracle/REST-Data-Services.

}
{ Oracle REST Data Services

  The default *context root* for accessing Oracle Application Express through Oracle REST Data Services is `/ords`.

}
{ Installation

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/apex[`$ORACLE_HOME/apex`], especially the scripts
    • → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/apex/apexins_sql[`apexins.sql`]
    • → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/apex/apxrtins_sql[`apxrtins.sql`]


}
{ User Accounts

  
  The APEX related accounts are created when → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/apex/apexins_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/apex/apexins.sql`] is executed.
  These accounts are:
  table { ll
    `APEX_vvvxxx` ☰
    `FLOW_FILES` ☰
    `APEX_PUBLIC_USER` ☰
    `APEX_INSTANCE_ADMIN_USER` ☰
  table }

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/apex/apex_rest_config_sql[`C:/Oracle/19/apex/apex_rest_config.sql`] also configures RESTful web services and creates two additional user accounts:
  table { ll
    `APEX_REST_PUBLIC_USER` ☰ is used for the execution of resource templates or APEX sessions.
    `APEX_LISTENER` ☰ is used by Oracle REST Data Services to access the schema objects in the `APEX_XXXXXX` schema containing resource templates and OAuth data. This uses is *not* used for execution of resource templates or APEX sessions.
  table }

  { APEX_PUBLIC_USER

   `apexins.sql` creates `APEX_PUBLIC_USER` user with a random → development/security/password. So, this password needs to be changed.
code {
alter user APEX_PUBLIC_USER identified by apexSecret;
code }

  }

}
{ Release numbers

  Starting in 2018, APEX release numbers correspond to the year in which a version was released.

}
