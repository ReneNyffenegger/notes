$ Oracle: INFORMATION_SCHEMA

Oracle does not come with an INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

However, *Lewis R. Cunningham* has started to create some views that emulate an INFORMATION_SCHEMA in Oracle, originally hosted on → https://sourceforge.net/projects/ora-info-schema/files/ora-info-schema/[source forge].
Since source forge is so last centuryish and his sources are released under the MIT licences, I allowed myself to copy them to a → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA[github repository] and
reformat them a bit.

{ Create the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema

  In order to install INFORMATION_SCHEMA, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema itself must be created and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[granted] the necessary privileges:
  gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/create_information_schema.sql||

}
{ Installing the views

  The views that go into the INFORMATION_SCHEMA are then installed with the `install_views.sql` script:
  gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/install_views.sql||

}
{ The views

  { catalog_name

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/catalog_name.sql||

  }
  { domains

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/domains.sql||

  }
  { routines

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/routines.sql||

    The view `routines` depends on `get_proc_text`:

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/get_proc_text.fnc||

  }
  { schemata

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/schemata.sql||

  }
  { tables

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/tables.sql||

  }
  { views

    gh|Oracle-INFORMATION_SCHEMA|/views.sql||

  }

}
