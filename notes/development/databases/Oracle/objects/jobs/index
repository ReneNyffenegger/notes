$ Oracle: Jobs
@ job

A *job* is the fundamental → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler/objects[scheduler object].

A *job* stores the information needed to run the task that the job describes. This information includes
  • the action (what is to be executed)
  • when and periodicity of the execution of the action
  • where the action is executed (see *destination* below)
  • the credentials (see below) with which the job is executed

A job has an owner: the schema in which it was created.

All jobs of a database can be viewed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/jobs[`dba_jobs`], the running ones in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/jobs/running[`dba_jobs_running`].

A job is created with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/scheduler/api/job/create[`dbms_scheduler.create_job`], multiple jobs can be created with
`dbms_scheduler.create_jobs`.

{ Types

  There are different job types:
  table { ll
    ~Type~ ☰ ~Notes~
    PL/SQL Block ☰ An anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block]. No arguments.
    Stored procedure ☰ A → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] or Java stored procedure, or a C «subprogram»
    → development/databases/Oracle/objects/jobs/types/executable[Executable] ☰ Any program that can be run on a command line (i.e. outside of an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[Oracle process]).
    Chain ☰ The job executes a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/chains[chain]. No arguments supported.
    → development/databases/Oracle/objects/jobs/types/external-script[External script] ☰ A script that is executed in a → Linux/shell (Unix/Linux) or in `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe` (Windows).

  table }

}
{ Attribute AUTO_DROP

  Each job has the boolean attribute `AUTO_DROP` which specifies if Oracle drops the job object when the object has completed.

  By default, this value is `true`.

}

sa:

  A job might use a username-password pairs to authenticate itself. Such pairs are stored in → development/databases/Oracle/objects/credentials objects.

  The value of the init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/job/queue/processes` defines the maximum number of processes that can be created for the execution of jobs.

  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs[Programs] and → development/databases/Oracle/objects/job-classes[job classes].

  A job is sometimes related to a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs.
