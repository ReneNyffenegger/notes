$ Oracle: Directories
@ directory

A directory object is an → development/databases/Oracle/objects that refers to a directory in the file system on the server (computer) where the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is running. The referred to directory does not have necessarily to exist (but if it doesn't, such a directory object is probably useless).
-
Directory objects allow to access data stored outside of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[database files] that are managed by Oracle, such as
  • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/external[external tables],
  • BFILEs or
  • datapump import/export files.
  • files access via `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/file`

Directory objects do not belong to a specific → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users.

{ ORA-00990 #ora-00990-directory

  There is no `create directory` → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privilege], the following command causes an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00990_missing-or-invalid-privilege error:
code {
SQL> grant create directory to rene;
code }

  Instead, `create any directory` (and possibly `drop any directory`) must be granted:
code {
SQL> grant create any directory to rene;
code }

  The reason there is no `create directory` privilege is because a directory is not owned by the user who created it (similarly to the `create any context` privilege).

}
{ ORA-00942 #ora-00942-directory

  In order to grant a permission on a directory, the `grant` statement needs to be told that the name is a directory. The following `grant` statement throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00942_table-or-view-does-not-exist (if `ext_files` is not a table or view):
code {
create directory ext_files as '/opt/oracle/ext_files';
grant read on ext_files to rene;
code }

  This statement is better:
code {
grant read on directory ext_files to rene;
code }

}

 `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utldirsymlink_sql` is a script that checks if any of the directories listed in
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/directories[`all_directories`] contains a symbolic link.
