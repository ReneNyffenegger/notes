$ Oracle: Directories
@ directory

A directory object is an → development/databases/Oracle/objects that refers to a directory in the file system on the server (computer) where the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is running.
-
Directory objects allow to access data stored outside of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[database files] that are managed by Oracle, such as
  • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/external[external tables],
  • BFILEs or
  • datapump import/export files.
  • files access via `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/file`

Directory objects do not belong to a specific → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users.

{ ORA-00990 #ora-00990-directory

  There is not `create directory` privilege, the following command causes an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00990_missing-or-invalid-privilege error:
code {
SQL> grant create directory to rene;
code }

  Instead, `create any directory` (and possibly `drop any directory`) must be granted:
code {
SQL> grant create any directory to rene;
code }

  The reason that there is no `create directory` privilege is because a directory is not owned by the user who created it.
