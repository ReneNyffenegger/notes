{ Hierarchy of Index type

  An index is either
    • non partitioned or
    • partitioned.

  A partitioned index is either a
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/partitioned/global[Global partitioned index], or a
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/partitioned/local[local partitioned index]

  A *local partitioned index* is either a
    • local *nonprefixed* index or a
    • local *prefixed* index

}

sa:

  A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/partitioned/global[global index] is similar to a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions[partitioned table]: depending on
  a criteria, multiple index-partititions are created.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary lists available indexes in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/indexes[`dba_indexes`].

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/space[dbms_space].create_index_cost` determines the cost of creating an index (on an existing → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables).
