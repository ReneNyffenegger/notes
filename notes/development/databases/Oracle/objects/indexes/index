{ Maximum key length #ora-index-max-key-len

  As per MOS Note, 136158.1, an index → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block is required to store at least two index values/entries and index values may not span multiple blocks.
  -
  Therefore, the maximum key length of an index depends on the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block#ora-db-block-size[block size].

  table { ll
     ~Block Size~ ☰ ~Max length~ (bytes)
      2K ☰ 1478 (758)
      4K ☰ 3118 (1578)
      8K ☰ 6398 (3218)
     16K ☰ 12958 (6498)
     32K ☰ 26510 (?)
  table }

{ Hierarchy of Index type

  An index is either
    • non partitioned or
    • partitioned.

  A partitioned index is either a
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/partitioned/global[Global partitioned index], or a
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/partitioned/local[local partitioned index]

  A *local partitioned index* is either a
    • local *nonprefixed* index or a
    • local *prefixed* index

sa:

  A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/partitioned/global[global index] is similar to a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions[partitioned table]: depending on
  a criteria, multiple index-partititions are created.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary lists available indexes in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/indexes` and
  their columns in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ind/columns`.
  -
 `dba_ind_columns` allows to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ind/columns/columns-of-index[query the columns in an index].

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/space[dbms_space].create_index_cost` determines the cost of creating an index (on an existing → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables).

  An index can be created or made → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/invisible[invisible] in which case the index is not considered by the → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer.
