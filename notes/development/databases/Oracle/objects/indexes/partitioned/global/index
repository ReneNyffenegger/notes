$ Oracle: global indexes

A *global index* is similar to a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions[partitioned table]: depending on
a criteria, multiple index-partititions are created each of which is its own → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes.

The following example creates a global index on a non-partitioned → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables.
