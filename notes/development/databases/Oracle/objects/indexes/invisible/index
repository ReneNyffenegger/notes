$ Oracle: Invisible indexes

An → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes can be created or made *invisible* in which case the index is not considered by the → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer (unless
the initialization parameter `optimizer_use_invisible_indexes` is set to `true`).

The purpose of making indexes invisible is
  • to test if dropping an index would be adversial to overall performance
  • using temporary indexes for a limited set of database tasks without affecting other tasks
  • creating an index with a subset of columns from an existing (invisible) index.
