$ Oracle: Bitmap Indexes
@ bitmap index

? A *bitmap index* stores → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/rowid/index[rowids] associated key values as a bitmap. A bitmap is maintained for each
distinct key.

Unlike with other indexes, bitmap indexes also create index entries for rows where all indexed column values are → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`].

When adding compressed data to a table with bitmap indexes, these indexes must be marked *unusable*.

Bitmap indexes that are marked *invalid* cannot be rebuilt. Such indexes must be dropeed and recreated instead.

A bitmap index cannot be created as «reversed» index.
