$ Drop Oracle objects

The following → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement returns a set of `drop …` statements. I use this script sometimes to quickly drop a list of «temporary»
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects that have accumulated
during the development of a feature or in a testing phase.
