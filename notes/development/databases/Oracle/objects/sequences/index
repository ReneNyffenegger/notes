$ Oracle sequences
@ sequence

A *sequence* creates an ever increasing number that is guaranteed to be unique (if they are not reset), even across different
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions]. This property makes them an ideal
candiate for a surrogate → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/primary-key.

A session can acquire a number from a sequence without blocking another session or waiting for another session that is *concurrently* acquiring a number from the
same sequence.
