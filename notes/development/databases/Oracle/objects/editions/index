$ Oracle: Editions
@ edition

A database has at least one edition. The first edition is named `ORA$BASE`.

The edition names are unique in their own → development/databases/Oracle/objects/_namespace.

An edition is an object without an owner.

An adition can have at most one child.

{ Simple example

code {
--
--  Kind of important:
--
alter user rene enable editions;

create edition tq84_ed_01;

select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects  where object_name  = 'TQ84_ED_01';
select * from dba_editions where edition_name = 'TQ84_ED_01';

alter session set edition = tq84_ed_01;

create editionable function tq84_f return varchar2 authid definer is begin
   return 'This function was created in edition 01';
end tq84_f;
/

select tq84_f from dual;

create edition tq84_ed_02;
alter session set edition = tq84_ed_02;
select tq84_f from dual;

create or replace  editionable function tq84_f return varchar2 authid definer is begin
   return 'This function was altered in edition 02';
end tq84_f;
/

select tq84_f from dual;

alter session set edition = tq84_ed_01;
select tq84_f from dual;
drop function tq84_f;

alter session set edition = ora$base;

--
--  Show current edition of object
--
select * from user_objects    where object_name = 'TQ84_F';
--
--  Unlike user_object, → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects/ae[user_objects_AE] lists all editions of an object
--
select * from user_objects_ae where object_name = 'TQ84_F';

drop edition tq84_ed_02;
--
-- ORA-38811: need CASCADE option to drop edition that has actual objects
--
drop edition tq84_ed_02 cascade;
drop edition tq84_ed_01 cascade;
