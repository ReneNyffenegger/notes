$ Oracle: clusters

Oracle allows to *cluster* data that belongs together (for example → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary]-→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign key]
relations in the same → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block. This is achieved by creating a *cluster* for the corresponding
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables].

Note: Such a cluster is different from → development/databases/Oracle/Options/real-application-clusters[Real Application Cluster].

{ Create the cluster

  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/create-cluster.sql||

}
{ Index

  A cluster requires an → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[index] (before → development/Data is inserted into the clustered tables).

  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/create-index.sql||

}
{ Clustered tables

  Create the tables «in» the cluster:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/create-tables.sql||

}
{ Inserts

  Inserting a few records into the tables

  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/insert.sql||

}
{ Data dictionary

  Two views in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary that are related to clusters are `dba_clu_columns` and `dba_clusters`:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/data-dictionary.sql||

}
{ Same block for related rows

  Using → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/rowid[`dbms_rowid`], it can be shown that records with the same cluster-id (cluster index) are stored in
  the same → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[database block]

  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/db-blocks.sql||

}
{ SQL execution plan
  
  When joining two clustered tables, the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan] does not seem to show that
  they're clustered:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Clusters/intro/plan.sql||

}


sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects
