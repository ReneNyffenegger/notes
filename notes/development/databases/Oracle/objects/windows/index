$ Oracle object: Window
@ window

A *window* is a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler/objects[scheduler object].

A window defines a period of time during which jobs can automatically be started.

A *window* associates a *resource plan* with a *recurring time window*.

At most one window is open at a given point in time:
code {
select
   value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/scheduler/global_attribute
where
   attribute_name = 'CURRENT_OPEN_WINDOW'
;
code }

Because windows' time spans might overlap, a window can be given a priority.

sa:

code {
select
   value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/scheduler/global_attribute
where
   attribute_name = 'FILE_WATCHER_COUNT'
;
code }

  → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Database objects]
