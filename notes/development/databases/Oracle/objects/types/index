$ Oracle PL/SQL Types

{ Persistable/non-persistable types #ora-plsql-type-persistable

  There are persistable and non persistable types.

  In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary, persistable and non-persistable types can be identified by the column `persistable` in
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/types`:
code {
select * from dba_types where persistable = 'YES';
code }

 I *assume* that non-persistable types can only be used in PL/SQL, not in SQL, see the error messages
   • *ORA-22384: cannot create a column or table of a non-persistable type*,
   • → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-40573_invalid-use-of-PL_SQL-JSON-object-type and
   • → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-40834_invalid-input-to-JSON-parse-load-function
    
}
