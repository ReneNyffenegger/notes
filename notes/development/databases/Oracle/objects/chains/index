$ Oracle: Chains
@ chain

A *chain* is a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler/objects[scheduler object] with which *dependent scheduling* is possible:
Jobs are then started depending on the outcomes of one or more other jobs, according to *dependency rules*.

These dependency rules define the conditions (such as success, failure or completion-code)
that can be used to start or stop a step or the chain itself.

Such a chain is a (named) series of → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs[programs] that are linked together for a combined object. A chain is created with `dbms_scheduler.create_chain`.

Rules can be added to a chain with `dbms_scheduler.define_chain_rule`.

Attributes of a chain include
  • pause
  • paused_before
  • skip
  • restart_on_failure
  • restart_on_recovery
  • destination_name (See `all_scheduler_external_dests` and `all_scheduler_db_dests`)
  • credential_name
