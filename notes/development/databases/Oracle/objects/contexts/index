$ Oracle: contexts
@ context

A context allows to set values within → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions]. These values can then be queried
with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/sys_context[`sys_context`].

A context's owner is → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users/oracle-maintained/sys[`sys`]. Thus, dropping the user who created a context does not automatically also drop the context.
Another implication is also that there is no `context` privilege, rather, it is `any context`.
