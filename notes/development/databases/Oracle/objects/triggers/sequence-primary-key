$ Oracle: Using a trigger and a sequence to provide the values for a primary key

A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables for the example:
code {
create table tq84_trigger_test (
    id   integer primary key,
    val  number(6,2)
);
code }

The following → development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences provides the values for the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key:
code {
create sequence tq84_trigger_seq;
code }

The followng → development/databases/Oracle/objects/triggers is executed when an `insert` statement is executed on the table. It uses
the sequence to assign a value to the id *if* the insert statement does not explicitely
provide one:
code {
create or replace trigger tq84_trigger_test
   before insert on tq84_trigger_test
   for each row
begin
   if :new.id is null then
      :new.id := tq84_trigger_seq.nextval;
   end if;
end;
/
code }

Trigger in action:
code {
insert into tq84_trigger_test (    val) values (      7.81);
insert into tq84_trigger_test (id, val) values (9999, 4.18);

select * from tq84_trigger_test;
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop table    tq84_trigger_test;
drop sequence tq84_trigger_seq;
code }
