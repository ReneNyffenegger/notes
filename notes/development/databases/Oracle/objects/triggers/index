$ Oracle Triggers
@ trigger

There are four types of triggers:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/triggers/types/DML/simple[DML triggers] (aka *simple DML triggers*)
  • Instead of DML triggers
  • Compound DML trigger
  • System triggers


A trigger is not permitted to commit or roll back a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction[transaction] *unless* the block is
declared with → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/pragma/autonomous_transaction[`pragma autonomous_transaction`] (see → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-04092_cannot-COMMIT-in-a-trigger).

Triggers have their own → development/databases/Oracle/objects/_namespace and can therefore have the same name as other → development/databases/Oracle/objects in the same schema.

The SQL statements of a trigger are not shown in the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan] of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[statement] that fires the trigger.

{ Logon trigger #ora-logon-triggers

  The following code is a *simple* example that tries to demonstrate how a logon trigger might be formulated. In real life, to record user logons, `aud$` would be used.
code {
create table logon_trigger_test (usr varchar2(128), ts date);

create or replace trigger someone_logged_on
   after logon on database
declare
   pragma autonomous_transaction;
begin

   insert into logon_trigger_test values (user, sysdate);
   commit;

end someone_logged_on;
/
code }

code {
drop trigger someone_logged_on;
drop table   logon_trigger_test;
code }

  { Logon triggers on a schema

    It's possible to create a trigger that just tracks the logons of a specific user (`after logon on schema` for the user creating the trigger,
    or `after logon on rene.schema` for the user `rene`):
code {
create table my_logons (d date);

create or replace trigger logon_trg after logon on schema
begin
   insert into my_logons values (sysdate);
   commit;
end logon_trg;
/
code }

    A failing logon trigger on schema does not prevent the user from logging in!

  }
  { Disabling logon triggers

    Logon triggers (as well as other system triggers) can be disabled by setting `_system_trigger_enabled` to `false`. This could be necessary if a logon trigger was written badly and prevents users from
    logging in.
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter set "_system_trig_enabled" = false scope=both;
code }

  }
  { Finding logon triggers in DBA_TRIGGERS

    Logon triggers are recorded in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/triggers` with a
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/triggers#dba_triggers_logon[trailing space in `triggering_event`].

  }

}
{ Catching erroneous SQL statements #ora-trigger-erroneous-sql

  The following example demonstrates how a `servererror` trigger can be used to catch erroneous
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements].

  First, we need a table to record the timestamp, the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[SQL error-code] and
  the failing SQL statement to:
code {
create table tq84_error (
    ts               timestamp,
    ora_server_error varchar2(4000),
    sql_stmt         clob
);
code }

  Then we create the trigger that gets fired when an SQL error is encountered:
code {
create or replace trigger tq84_error -- Triggers can have same name as other objects in schema - let's take advantage of this feature!
       after servererror on schema
declare
   stmt_pieces ora_name_list_t;
   nof_pieces  number;
   stmt        clob;
begin

   nof_pieces := ora_sql_txt(stmt_pieces);

   for piece in 1 .. nof_pieces loop
       stmt := stmt || stmt_pieces(piece);
   end loop;

   insert into tq84_error values (
       systimestamp,
       ora_server_error(1),
       stmt
   );

   commit;

exception when others then
--
-- Do not permit recursive errors.
--
   null;
end;
/
code }

  Provoke an error on purpose to test the trigger:
code {
create table tq84_foo(a number, b varchar2(20));
insert /* stmt 1 */ into tq84_foo values (1, 'one');
insert /* stmt 2 */ into tq84_foo values ('a', 'two');
--  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01722_invalid-number
select * from tq84_error order by ts desc;
code }
