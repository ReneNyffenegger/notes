{ Logon trigger

  The following code is a *simple* example that tries to demonstrate how a logon trigger might be formulated. In real life, to record user logons, `aud$` would be used.
code {
create table logon_trigger_test (usr varchar2(128), ts date);

create or replace trigger someone_logged_on
   after logon on database
declare
   pragma autonomous_transaction;
begin

   insert into logon_trigger_test values (user, sysdate);
   commit;

end someone_logged_on;
/
code }

code {
drop trigger someone_logged_on;
drop table   logon_trigger_test;
code }

  { Disabling logon triggers

    Logon triggers (as well as other system triggers) can be disabled by setting `_system_trigger_enabled` to `false`. This could be necessary if a logon trigger was written badly and prevents users from
    loggin in.
code {
alter system set "_system_trig_enabled" = false scope=both;
code }

  }

}
