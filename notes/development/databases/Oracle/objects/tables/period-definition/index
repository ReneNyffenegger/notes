$ Oracle: Tables with PERIOD DEFINITIONS

A *period definition clause* in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables definition adds *temporal validity* to that table.

This clause requires two → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[`date`] or
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/timestamp[`timestamp`] → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] to specify each row's
period during which the row is considered valid.
-
If these columns are not named during the creation of the period defintion, Oracle will supply these columns and name then `valid_time_col_START` and
`valid_time_col_END` and make them invisible.
