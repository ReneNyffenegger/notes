$ Oracle: Foreign key constraint
@ foreign key

A *foreign key* constraint is also (and possibly more correctly) referred to as «referential integrity constraint», and consequently shows up in the column
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints/constraint_type[`constraint_type`]
(→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] view → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints[`all_constraint`]) as `R`.

{ Extracting foreign key creation statements with DBMS_METADATA #ora-fk-metadata

  The following statements use → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata/api/get/ddl[`dbms_metadata.get_ddl`] to extract statements that create
  foreign keys:
code {
begin
   dbms_metadata.set_transform_param (dbms_metadata.session_transform, 'SQLTERMINATOR', true);
   dbms_metadata.set_transform_param (dbms_metadata.session_transform, 'PRETTY'       , true);
end;
/

select
   dbms_metadata.get_ddl ('REF_CONSTRAINT', cfk.constraint_name, cfk.owner)
from
   all_constraints cfk  join
   all_constraints cpk  on cfk.r_owner           = cpk.owner             and
                           cfk.r_constraint_name = cpk.constraint_name
where
   cfk.owner           = 'TABLE_OWNER'   and
   cpk.table_name      = 'SOME_TABLE'    and
   cpk.constraint_type IN ('P','U')      and
   cfk.constraint_type = 'R'
;
code }

}
