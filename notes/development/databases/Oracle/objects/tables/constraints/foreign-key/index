$ Oracle: Foreign key constraint
@ foreign key

A *foreign key* constraint is also (and possibly more correctly) referred to as «referential integrity constraint*, and consequently shows up in the column
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints/constraint_type[`constraint_type`]
(→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] view → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints[`all_constraint`]) as `R`.
