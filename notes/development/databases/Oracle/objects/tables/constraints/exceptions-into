$ Oracle SQL: EXCEPTIONS INTO clause (validation of primary keys)
@ exceptions into

The following example uses Oracle's SQL clause `exceptions into` to write the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/rowid[rowids] of records, that violate the uniqueness
of a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary key], into a table so that the → development/Data/quality[data quality] problem can then
be fixed.

sa:

  An `exception` table can be created with `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utlexcpt_sql`.
