$ Oracle: Primary key constraint
@ primary key

{ Naming the index of the primary key

code {
create table tq84_tab (
   id   number /*not null*/,
   val  varchar2(10)
);

create unique index tq84_tab_ix on tq84_tab(id);

alter table tq84_tab add primary key (id);
code }

  Or, alternatively…
code {
drop  table tq84_tab;

create table tq84_tab (
   id   number
           constraint tq84_tab_pk primary key
           using index (
             create unique index tq84_tab_ix on tq84_tab(id)
           ),
   val  varchar2(10)
);
code }


}
{ Dropping the primary key, but keeping the index

code {
alter table tq84_tab drop constraint tq84_tab_pk keep index;
select * from user_indexes where table_name = 'TQ84_TAB';
code }

}

{ Dropping tables referenced by other tables

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/drop/cascade-constraints[`cascade constraints`] clause of the `drop table` statement allows to drop a table that are referenced
  by → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys] of other tables.

  Thus, this clause is useful to prevent → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-02449_unique-primary-keys-in-table-referenced-by-foreign-keys error messages.

}
{ RELY

  By specifying `rely` with the primary key, Oracle will trust that the applications modifying the data in the table will only make changes that maintain the unique identifyability of
  the record.

code {
alter table tq84_table
  add primary key (
    col_one,
    col_two
  )
  rely
  disable;
code }
