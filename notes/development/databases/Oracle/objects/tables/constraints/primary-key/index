$ Oracle: Primary key constraint
@ primary key

{ rely

  By specifiying `rely` with the primary key, Oracle will trust that the applications modifying the data in the table will only make changes that maintain the unique identifyablity of
  the record.

code {
alter table tq84_table
  add primary key (
    col_one,
    col_two
  )
  rely
  disable;
code }
