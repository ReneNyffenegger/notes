$ Oracle: Recycle bin
@ recycle bin

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects[Objects] that were moved to the recyclebin typically have names starting with 'BIN$'.

{ Simple example

  Empty the recycle bin for this example:
code {
purge recyclebin;  
code }

  Make sure the recycle bin functionality is enabled for this session:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session/set/init-param[alter session set] recyclebin = on;
code }
 
   Create a table with an index (primary key) …
code {
create table tq84_recyclebin_test (
   id  integer generated always as identity primary key,
   val number(6,2)
);
code }
 
  … and fill a few values:
code {
insert into tq84_recyclebin_test (val) values (7.01);
insert into tq84_recyclebin_test (val) values (5.83);
insert into tq84_recyclebin_test (val) values (5.26);
 
commit;
code }

  Drop table:
code {
drop table tq84_recyclebin_test;
code }

  Table is not actually dropped, but moved to the recycle bin:
code {
select
   object_name,
   original_name,
   type,
   can_undrop,
   operation
from
   user_recyclebin;
code }
  
  Undrop the table:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/flashback tq84_recyclebin_test to before drop;
code }
 
   The recycle bin is empty again …
code {
select count(*) from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/recyclebin[user_recyclebin];
code }
 
  … and the original table is restored:
code {
select * from tq84_recyclebin_test;
code }
 
   Drop the table again, this time, use the `purge` clause so that the table does not go to the recycle bin again:
code {
drop table tq84_recyclebin_test purge;
code }

}
{ TODO

  Show the content of the recycle bin in SQL, using the data dictionary:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Tables/RecycleBin/show_recycle_bin_sql.sql||

→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/show[Show] the content of the recycle bin in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Tables/RecycleBin/show_recycle_bin_sqlplus.sql||

Purge the recycle bin:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Tables/RecycleBin/purge.sql||

}

sa:

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/recyclebin`
