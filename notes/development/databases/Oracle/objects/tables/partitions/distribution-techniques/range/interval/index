$ Oracle: Interval partioned tables

*Interval partitioning* is a variant of → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/range[range partitioning]: Oracle will create new partiations automatically when
then inserted value requires it.

Interval partitioned tables only support a subset of the capabilites of range partitioned tables.
  • 
  • *serializable transactions* to not work
  • VARRAY and nested-columns cannot be created

When an interval partitioned table is created, at least one range partition must be specified.

Interval partitions cannot be created as sub-partitions.
