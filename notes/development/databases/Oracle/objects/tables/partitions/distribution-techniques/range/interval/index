$ Oracle: Interval partitioned tables

*Interval partitioning* is a variant of → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/range[range partitioning]: Oracle will create new partiations automatically when
then inserted value requires it.

Interval partitioned tables only support a subset of the capabilites of range partitioned tables.
  • *serializable transactions* do not work
  • VARRAY and nested-columns cannot be created

Only one column can be used for the partitioning criteria. The column's data type must be `number`, `date`, `float` or `timestamp`.

When an interval partitioned table is created, at least one range partition must be specified.

Interval partitions cannot be created as sub-partitions.

  The day that is used in the partitioning clause must not be greater than 28, otherwise, Oracle throws an
