$ Oracle: interval partioned tables

*Interval partitioning* is a variant of â†’ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/range[range partitioning]: Oracle will create new partiations automatically when
then inserted value requires it. However, interval partitioned tables only support a subset of the capabilites of range partitioned tables.

When an interval partitioned table is created, at least one range partition must be spefified.
