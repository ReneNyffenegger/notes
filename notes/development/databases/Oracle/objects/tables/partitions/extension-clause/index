$ Oracle: Partition extension clause
@ partition extension clause

In an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement, the *partition  extension clause* allows to treat a single partition of a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions[partitioned] table as an entire table.

A simple case of the partition extension clause is demonstrated with the following statements.

First, we need a partitioned table …
code {
create table tq84_tab_part (
   num   integer           check (num between 0 and 1e5 -1) not null,
   txt  varchar2(10)
)
partition by range (num) (
   partition  rng_1  values less than (0.25e5  ),
   partition  rng_2  values less than (0.50e5  ),
   partition  rng_3  values less than (0.75e5  ),  
   partition  rng_4  values less than (maxvalue)
);
code }
 
… with some data:
code {
insert into tq84_tab_part
select
   level -1,
   dbms_random.string('a', 10)
from
   dual
connect by level <= 1e5;
code }
 
Then, we select from all four partitions and combine results with `union all`. The partition extension clause is `table_name(partition_name)`:
code {
select count(*), min(num), max(num), max(txt) from  tq84_tab_part partition(rng_1)  union all
select count(*), min(num), max(num), max(txt) from  tq84_tab_part partition(rng_2)  union all
select count(*), min(num), max(num), max(txt) from  tq84_tab_part partition(rng_3)  union all
select count(*), min(num), max(num), max(txt) from  tq84_tab_part partition(rng_4);
--
--   COUNT(*)   MIN(NUM)   MAX(NUM) MAX(TXT)  
-- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
--      25000          0      24999 zzzQJukyhS
--      25000      25000      49999 zzuPZmEXOR
--      25000      50000      74999 zzyPpfPIjf
--      25000      75000      99999 zzyqbzXzpW
code }
 

It's also possible to select from the partition in which a given value of the partition key resides (here, the partition into which the record with `num` equal to 55555 is located):
code {
select count(*), min(num), max(num), max(txt) from tq84_tab_part partition for (55555);
-- 
--   COUNT(*)   MIN(NUM)   MAX(NUM) MAX(TXT)  
-- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
--      25000      50000      74999 zzyPpfPIjf
code }

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/rowid#dbms_rowid-record-partition[`dbms_rowid.rowid_object`] can be used to determine the name of a partition where a record is located
  based on the record's rowid.

  When misstakingly formulating the partition extension clause with `for partition (…)` instead of the correct `partition for (…)`, Oracle throws an
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01786_FOR-UPDATE-of-this-query-expression-is-not-allowed error.
