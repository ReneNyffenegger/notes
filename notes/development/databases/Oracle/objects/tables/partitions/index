$ Oracle: Partitioned tables

{ Partition techniques

  Each record in a partitioned → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables is assigned to an unambiguous partition.

  There are three distribution techniques to determine the partition into which a record falls:
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/range[Range]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/hash[Hash]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/list[List]

  A variant of the *range partioning* is → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/range/interval[interval partitioning]: Oracle will automatically create the new partitions when an inserted (or updated?) value requires it.

  { Composite partitioned

    With *composite partioning*, two partition techniques are combined so that there are two levels: partition and sub-partition.

    The top level allows all four paritioning types. The second level does not allow interval partitioning. Thus, the total combinations
    of composite partitions is 12 (=4*3), for example:
      • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/composite#ora-comp-part-range-list[range - list],
      • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/composite#ora-comp-part-range-range[range - range] or
      • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/composite#ora-comp-part-list-hash[list - hash].
      • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions/distribution-techniques/composite#ora-comp-part-interval-list[interval - list]

{ Data dictionary

  Available characteristics and other data pertaining to partitions tables can be queried in the
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/partitions` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/subpartitions`.
  -
  The views pertaining to partioned → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] are
 `all_ind_partitions` and `all_ind_subpartitions`.

  A partitioned table is marked with `YES` in the column `partitioned` of `dba_tables`:
code {
select
   partitioned,   -- 'YES'
   num_rows,
   blocks
from
   dba_tables
where
   owner      = 'RENE' and
   table_name = 'HIST_ABC';
code }

   The individual partitions that belong to a partitioned table are found in `dba_tab_partitions`:
code {
select
   composite,
   partition_position,
   partition_name,
   subpartition_count,
   high_value,
   num_rows,
   blocks
   high_value_length
from
   all_tab_partitions
where
   table_owner  = 'RENE'                and
   table_name   = 'HIST_ABC';
code }

   If the table is also sub-partitioned, the sub-partitions can be queried from `dba_tab_subpartitions`:
code {
select
   subpar.partition_name,
   subpar.subpartition_name,
   tabpar.high_value             tabpar_high_value,
   subpar.high_value             subpar_high_value,
   subpar.num_rows               subpar_num_rows,
   subpar.blocks                 subpar_blocks,
   tabpar.high_value_length      tabpar_high_value_length,
   subpar.high_value_length      subpar_high_value_length,
   subpar.partition_position,
   subpar.subpartition_position
from
   all_tab_partitions    tabpar   join
   all_tab_subpartitions subpar on
       tabpar.table_owner    = subpar.table_owner and
       tabpar.partition_name = subpar.partition_name
where
   subpar.table_owner = 'RENE' and
   subpar.table_name  = 'HIST_ABC'
order by
   subpar.partition_position,
   subpar.subpartition_position;
code }


  The → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] on whose values a table is partitioned:
code {
select
   column_name
from
   all_part_key_columns
where
   owner  = 'RENE'                 and
   name   = 'HIST_ABC'
order by
   column_position;
code }

  The → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] on whose values a sub-partitioned table is partitioned:
code {
select
   column_name
from
   all_subpart_key_columns
where
   owner = 'RENE' and
   name  = 'HIST_ABC';
code }

}
