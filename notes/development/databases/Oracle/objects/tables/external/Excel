$ Oracle: Reading Excel sheets with external tables

 This example tries to demonstrate how → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[Excel sheets] can be read with → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/external[external tables]

First, in the filesystem where Oracle is running, we create a directory into which the Excel workbooks will be stored from which an Excel sheet will be loaded.
code {
# su - oracle
$ mkdir /opt/oracle/ext
code }

Then, we make sure that only `oracle` can see its contents.
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/chmod 700 /opt/oracle/ext
code }

We also need a directory where the Python script `xlsx2csv.py` will be stored:
code {
$ mkdir  /opt/oracle/xlsx2csv
$ → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone[git clone] → https://github.com/dilshod/xlsx2csv /opt/oracle/xlsx2csv
code }

Fix the script's → Linux/shell/script/shebang because Oracle sets the `PATH` environment variable very restrictivly when calling the script:
code {
$ → development/languages/sed → development/languages/sed/in-place-editing[-i] '1s|.*|#!/usr/bin/python3|' /opt/oracle/xlsx2csv/xlsx2csv.py
code }

We also need a directory object for the directory where the script is located:
code {
create directory        XLSX2CSV as '/opt/oracle/xlsx2csv';
grant read on directory XLSX2CSV to rene;
code }

We're now able to create the external table
code {
create table ext_table_xlsx (
   i   number,
   n   varchar2(20),
   m   varchar2(20)
)
organization external (
   type              oracle_loader
   default directory ext_dir
   access parameters (
      records delimited  by newline
      preprocessor xlsx2csv:'xlsx2csv.py'
      nologfile
      nobadfile      
      fields  terminated by ','
      missing field values are null
   )
   location ('a.xlsx')
)
-- reject limit 0 /* 0 is the default anyway */
;
code }

Finally:
code {
select * from ext_table_xlsx;
code }

sa:

  Reading → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/external/CSV[CSV files] with → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/external[external tables].
