$ Oracle: External Tables

{ Types of external tables

  There are four types of external tables. Depending on the type, Oracle uses a different driver to access the data in the external table:
  table { ll
   ~Driver~ ☰
    Oracle loader ☰ The default driver. External data is read only and resides in a text file (for example a → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV file).
    Oracle datapump ☰ The external data is stored in binary dump files. Exporting data to the external location is possible, but the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML `update` and `delete` cannot be used to modify the external data.
    Oracle HDFS ☰ Data is stored in a → development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS[Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)]
    Oracle HIVE ☰ Data is stored in → development/Apache/Hive[Apache HIVE].
