$ Oracle: Reading CSV files with external tables

This example tries to demonstrate how → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV files can be read with → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/external[external tables]

First, we need a CSV-file whose data we want to import into the database. I put this file into the directory
`→ Linux/fhs/home/username[home/rene]/ext` (or when on Windows into `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username[C:\Users\Rene]/ext/`) and named it `file.csv`:
code {
1,one,first
2,two,second
3,three,third
4,four,fourth
code }

Create a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/directories[directory object] and grant read (at least) and write to the user that wants the external table:
code {
connect / as sysdba

create    directory ext_dir as '/home/rene/ext';
-- create directory ext_dir as 'C:\Users\Rene\ext';

grant read write to rene
code }

Create the external table:
code {
connect rene/rene

create table ext_table_csv (
   i   number,
   n   varchar2(20),
   m   varchar2(20)
)
organization external (
   type              oracle_loader
   default directory ext_dir
   access parameters (
      records delimited  by newline
      fields  terminated by ','
      missing field values are null
   )
   location ('file.csv')
)
reject limit unlimited;
code }

code {
select * from ext_table_csv;
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop directory ext_dir;
code }

{ Error messages in Windows

  In Windows, I have received the following error:
code {
ORA-29913: error in executing ODCIEXTTABLEOPEN callout
ORA-29400: data cartridge error
KUP-04040: file file.csv in EXT_DIR not found
code }

  I fixed this by giving the Oracle Service (process) the required privileges on the file (See → development/databases/Oracle/errors/KUP/04040_file_in_-not-found/Windows[KUP-04040]).
  -
  After fixing this error, I had a *KUP-04027: file name check failed* error which I was able to fix by granting the necessary privileges on `$home/ext` (See
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/KUP/04027_file-name-check-failed/Windows[KUP-04027])

}
