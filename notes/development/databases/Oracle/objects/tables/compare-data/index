$ Oracle: Compare the data of two tables

With a combination of the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators[set operators] `union` and `minus`, it is possible to execute
an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement that compares the data of two tables returns their difference.

code {
create table tq84_A (num  number, txt varchar2(10));
create table tq84_B (num  number, txt varchar2(10));
 
insert into tq84_A values(1, 'one'  );
insert into tq84_A values(2, 'two'  );
insert into tq84_A values(3, 'three');
insert into tq84_A values(4, 'four' );
 
insert into tq84_B values(1, 'one'  );
insert into tq84_B values(3, 'THREE');
insert into tq84_B values(4, 'four' );
insert into tq84_B values(5, 'five' );
 
select 'only A' where_, only_a.* from (select num, txt from tq84_A minus select num, txt from tq84_B) only_a union all
select 'only B' where_, only_b.* from (select num, txt from tq84_B minus select num, txt from tq84_A) only_b;
 
drop table tq84_A;
drop table tq84_B;
code }

Of course, wrting such an SQL statement is tedious. We should let Oracle create the SQL statement for us.
An example of such a statement is here: → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/compare-data/create-diff-statement[Create an SQL Statement that compares two tables].

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/comparison[`dbms_comparison`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/diff-structure[Determine difference between the structure of two tables]
