$ Oracle: Temporary Tables

There are three types of *temporary tables*:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/global-temporary[Global temporary tables]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/temporary/private[Private temporary tables]
  • Cursor-duration temporary tables

Unlike other → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statements], the creation of temporary tables does not implicitely commit the current
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction[transaction].
