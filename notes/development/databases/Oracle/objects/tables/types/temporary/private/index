$ Oracle: Private Temporary Tables

Private temporary tables are stored in memory. Private temporary tables exist no longer than the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session in which they were created.

The prefix of the name of a *private temporary table* must be the same as the value of the init parameter
`→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/private_temp_table_prefix` (which defaults to `ORA$PTT_`).

Although the data of a private temporary is only visible in the session where the table was created, the table name
can be queried from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/private_temp_tables`.

{ Creating a private temporary table

  Note the prefix of the table name:
code {
create private temporary table ora$ptt_renes_temp_table (
   num   number,
   txt   varchar2(20)
);
code }

When created, → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML] and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select`] statements can be performed on the table as being used from ordinary heap tables:
code {
insert into   ora$ptt_renes_temp_table values (1, 'x');
insert into   ora$ptt_renes_temp_table values (2, 'y');
update        ora$ptt_renes_temp_table set num = 3 where txt = 'y';
delete   from ora$ptt_renes_temp_table where num = 1;
select * from ora$ptt_renes_temp_table;
code }

However, when the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction ends (and the table was not created with `on commit preserve definition`), the table automatically gets deleted:
code  {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[commit];

select * from ora$ptt_renes_temp_table;
--
-- ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
code }

}
{ ON COMMIT PRESERVE DEFINITION

  The `on commit preserve defnition` clause allows a temporary private table to be outlive a transaction:

code {
create private temporary table ora$ptt_xyz (
   num   number,
   txt   varchar2(20)
)
on commit preserve definition;

insert into ora$ptt_xyz values (1, 'one');
commit;
select * from ora$ptt_xyz;
code }

}
{ Creation of a private temporary table does not commit the current transaction #ora-ptt-no-commit

  Unlike other → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DD[DDL statements], the `create temporary table` statement does not
  commit the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction.

code {
create table tq84_trx (id number);

insert into tq84_trx values(1);
commit;

insert into tq84_trx values(2);

--
-- Following statement does not commit (or rollback)
-- the current transaction
--
create private temporary table ora$ptt_trx (
   num   number,
   txt   varchar2(20)
)
on commit preserve definition;

--
-- Removes uncommited number 2 from tq84_trx
--
rollback;

--
-- Selects one record with num = 1
--
select * from tq84_trx;
code }

}
