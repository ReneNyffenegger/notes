$ Oracle table columns

{ Default values

  A column can be assigned a default value with which the column is filled in an `insert` statement if no explicit value is stated. This default value can
  be a non-constant value such as → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate[`sysdate`], `systimestamp` or come from a
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences[sequence].

  In an existing table, a column can be altered to have a default value like so:
code {
alter table log_entry modify time_entered  default systimestamp;
code }

  As of → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/19c, the maximum number of columns in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table] or
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[view] is 1000.

  However, a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statement] can return up to 8160 columns after which the error message *ORA-00913: too many columns* is thrown.

  The maximum number of columns that can be stored in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block is 255.
