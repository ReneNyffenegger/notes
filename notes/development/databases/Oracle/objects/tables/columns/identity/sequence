$ Oracle: Using an identity column silently creates a sequence

Behind the scenes, Oracle creates a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences for → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/identity[identity columns].

code {
create table tq84_ident_test (
   id   integer generated always as identity primary key,
   val  number(6,2)
);

select
   object_name,
   (sysdate - created) * 24*60*60 created_secs_ago,
   user_objects.*
from
   user_objects
where
   object_type = 'SEQUENCE'
order by
   created desc;
   
drop table tq84_ident_test;
code }

In Oracle's free edition of → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c, → https://twitter.com/renenyffenegger/status/1653675439980724224[the sequence is not dropped] when the table is dropped.
