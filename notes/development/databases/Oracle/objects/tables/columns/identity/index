$ Oracle: identity columns

A column can be declared as *identity column*. Each identity column is associated with a *sequence generator*. This generator supplies an increasing or decreasing integer value to the column if necessary.

If the sequence generator generates a value depends on the characteristics of the identity column. There are three main characteristics 
table { ll
  `generated always` ☰ Value is always supplied and cannot be overridden with `value(…)` clause.
  `generated by default` ☰ Value is supplied if not explicitly overridden.
  `generated by default on null` ☰ Value only supplied if inserted value is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`] or omitted.
table }

Note that the sequence generator does not guarantee that the values in the destination columns are unique. These values can be updated or sometimes overridden in the `insert` statement.

It should also be kept in mind that an identity column does not automatically create a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary key].

{ ORA-01031: insufficient privileges

  In order to create tables with identity columns, the `create sequence` → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privilege] is required. Without that privilege, the error message
