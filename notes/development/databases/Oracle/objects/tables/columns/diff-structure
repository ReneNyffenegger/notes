$ Oracle: Simple way to determine the structural difference between two table structures

The following example demonstrates how the structure (i.e. → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns names and their → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types]) of two
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] can be compared.
-
(An example that compares the data of two tables is → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/compare-data[here]).

{ Create two tables

  Two tables are created to test the SQL statement below that find structural differences in them:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Tables/columns/diff-structure/create-tables.sql||

}
{ Select the difference between their structures

  The following statement finds column that are either missing in one of the two tables being compared or have
  different → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] or characteristics.

  Because the statement uses a *full outer join*, the compared columns appear on *one* record in the result set:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/DatabaseObjects/Tables/columns/diff-structure/diff.sql||

}

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/compare-data[Compare the data of two tables]

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/columns[`all_tab_columns`]
