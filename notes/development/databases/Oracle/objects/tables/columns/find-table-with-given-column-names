$ Oracle: Find tables with given set of column names

The following queries finds all → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] that have the
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[column] names listed in the `column_name in (…)` condition.
-
If the number of column names is changed in the condition, the value of the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate/having[`having` clause]
needs to be changed as well.
code {
select
   owner,
   table_name
from
   dba_tab_cols
where
   column_name in ('ID', 'TXT', 'DT', 'FLT', 'DBL')
group by
   owner,
   table_name
having
   count(*) = 5   -- <== Change number 
;
code }

Sometimes, we can only guess the name of the columns and need to search with `like` (or even → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/regular_expressions/regexp_like[`regexp_like`]) as
demonstrated in the following query. In order to improve the query's performance, I have also added `where … owner = user`. This condition needs to lifted or modified depending on
table names and/or schema names that are looked for.
code {
select
   owner,
   table_name
from
   dba_tab_cols
where
(  
   column_name like 'I%'    or
   column_name like '_X_'   or
   column_name like '%T'    or
   column_name like 'F_T'   or
   column_name like 'DB%'
)
and
   owner = user
group by
   owner,
   table_name
having
   count(*) = 5
;
code }
