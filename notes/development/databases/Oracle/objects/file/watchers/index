$ Oracle: File Watchers
@ file watcher

A *file watcher* is a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler/objects[scheduler object] that triggers the
→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler to start a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/jobs when a file with a given name and location «arrives». 

By default, a file watcher checks for new file arrivales every 10 minutes.

A file watcher object is crated with `dbms_scheduler.create_file_watcher`.

In order to use file watchers, the database Java Virtual Machine (JVM) component must be installed.
