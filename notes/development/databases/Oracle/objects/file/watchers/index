$ Oracle: File Watchers
@ file watcher

A *file watcher* is a → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler/objects[scheduler object] that triggers the
→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/scheduler to start a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/jobs when a file with a given name and location «arrives». 

By default, a file watcher checks for new file arrivals every 10 minutes.

A file watcher object is created with `dbms_scheduler.create_file_watcher`.

In order to use file watchers, the database Java Virtual Machine (JVM) component must be installed.

{ Change the default exection interval

  Change the default execution interval to one minute:
code {
begin
 
   dbms_scheduler.set_attribute(
      'file_watcher_schedule',
      'repeat_interval',
      'freq=minutely; interval=1'
   );
 
end;
/
code }

}
