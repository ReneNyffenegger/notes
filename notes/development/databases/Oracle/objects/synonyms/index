{ Foreign key constraints #ora-syn-fk

  A synonym name can be used when creating a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key constraint:
code {
create table   tq84_p ( id integer primary key );
create synonym tq84_s for tq84_p;
create table   tq84_c ( x references tq84_s );
 
select
   pk.table_name
from
   user_constraints pk       join
   user_constraints fk on fk.r_constraint_name = pk.constraint_name
where
   fk.table_name = 'TQ84_C';
  
drop   synonym tq84_s;  
   
drop table tq84_c;
drop table tq84_p;
code }

}
