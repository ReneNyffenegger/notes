{ Object types #ora-obj-types

  There is quite a list of available *object types*. The list of object types can be queried by first expanding the SQL statement text of
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects` …
code {
declare
   c clob;
begin
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility/api/expand_sql_text[dbms_utility.expand_sql_text]('select*from"DBA_OBJECTS"', c);
   dbms_output.put_line(c);
end;
code }
  … and then finding the relevant `decode` statement:
code {
decode("A14"."TYPE#",
  0, 'NEXT OBJECT',
  1, 'INDEX'      ,
  2, 'TABLE'
  …
)
code }

  This gives me the list of possible object types (19c).

  I thought a  *Database Link* is an object type as well, but apparently is not so.
  -
  A Database Link allows to access objects that are stored in other databases. If the other database is not an Oracle database system, they must be accessed with *Oracle Heterogeneous Services*.

  The set of types that are *editionable* depends on the value of the
  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/compatible[the init parameter `compatible`] and can be queried from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/editionable_types`.

  TODO: Are these objects defined in `kgl.h`?

}
{ Data dictionary

  Oracle stores information about database objects in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary.

  A list of all objects is found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects[`dba_objects`].
  -
  Invalid objects are listed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/invalid_objects[`dba_invalid_objects`]

  { OBJ$
  
    Internally, «under the hood», Oracle stores basic object information in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/obj[`sys.obj$`].
  
  }

}
{ Ownership #ora-obj-owner

  Objects (with the exemption of certain types?) have an owner, which is a → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users. The objects are found in the user's schema.

}
{ Privileges

  In order for users to be able to access an Object, they must be → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[granted] the respective privileges.

  The matrix of grants and objects can be queried through the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] views
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[`dba_tab_privs`, `all_tab_privs` and `user_tab_privs`].

}
{ Object names #ora-obj-name

  Every object has a name.

  All names must be unique within an → development/databases/Oracle/objects/_namespace[object namespace].

  The maximum length of the name is 128 bytes if `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/compatible` is set to at least `12.2.0` and 30 bytes otherwise.

  If names are unquoted, they are silently converted to uppercase. Thus, the following two statements are considered equal:
code {
SELECT col_a, col_b from TAB;
SELECT COL_A, COL_B from TAB;
code }

  Names can be quoted with double-apostrophes. Quoted names are case sensitive and allow for funny characters:
code {
create table "The bad & the ugly!" ("x/y" number, "20% rule" varchar2(10));
code }

  Object names should not start with either `SYS_` or `ORA_` because `SYS_*` is used objects implicitely created by Oracle and `ORA_` is used for Oracle supplied objects.

  An object (except a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/temporary/private[private temporary table]) whose name starts with the prefix which is specified for
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/temporary/private[private temporary tables] (i. e. the value of the init
  parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/private_temp_table_prefix`) results in the error message
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-32463_cannot-create-an-object-with-a-name-matching-private-temporary-table-prefix.

}

sa:

  Definitions of an object can be extracted as → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statements] or → development/XML/DOM/nodes/document[XML documents] using the
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata[`dbms_metadata`] package.
  -
  Metadata of Oracle objects can be described in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata_diff#dbms_metadata_diff-SXML[SXML].

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utldtree_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utldtree.sql`] creates tables and views that show dependencies between objects.

  Renaming objects (tables, views, sequences and private → development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms[synonyms]) with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/rename[SQL verb `rename`].

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statement] to (re-)create an object can be obtained with
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata/api/get/ddl[`dbms_metadata.get_ddl`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility/name_resolve[`dbms_utility.name_resolve`]

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ind/columns/columns-of-index[Show columns of an index]

  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand/ExecuteNonQuery#odac-OracleCommand-ExecuteNonQuery-install-db-obj[Installing database objects] with
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand/ExecuteNonQuery[`ExecuteNonQuery()`] of
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand[`Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleCommand`].
  
  Manipulation of Objects can be tracked with
  SQL execution can be tracked with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[auditing].
