@ objects

A *Database Link* allows to access objects that are stored in other databases. If the other database is not an Oracle database system, they must be accessed
with *Oracle Heterogeneous Services*.

A *Directory* is an abstraction for a directory/folder on the file system where the Oracle Instance is running.
-
Such directories can be used for example in conjunction with the *BFILE* → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data type].

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[Indexes]

A *Materialized View* stores the result of an SQL query.
-
Associated with a Materialized View is the *Materialized View Log*.

A *Queue* enqueues and dequeues messages and is managed by Oracle Streams Advanced Queueing (AQ).
-
These messages are stored in *Queue Tables*.

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences[Sequences]

AN *SQL Translator* converts a non-Oracle SQL dialect to SQL Statements that are understood by Oracle.

  A list of all objects is found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects[`dba_objects`]

}
{ Privileges

  In order for users to be able to access an Object, they must be → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[granted] the respective privileges.

  The matrix of grants and objects can be queried through the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] views
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[`dba_tab_privs`, `all_tab_privs` and `user_tab_privs`].

sa:
  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utldtree_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utldtree.sql`] creates tables and views that show dependencies between objects.
