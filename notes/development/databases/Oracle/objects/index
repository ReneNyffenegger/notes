$ Oracle Objects
@ objects

A *Database Link* allows to access objects that are stored in other databases. If the other database is not an Oracle database system, they must be accessed
with *Oracle Heterogeneous Services*.

A *Directory* is an abstraction for a directory/folder on the file system where the Oracle Instance is running.
-
Such directories can be used for example in conjunction with the *BFILE* → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data type].

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[Indexes]

A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized[Materialized View] stores the result of an SQL query.
-
Associated with a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized[Materialized View] is the *Materialized View Log*.

A *Queue* enqueues and dequeues messages and is managed by Oracle Streams Advanced Queueing (AQ).
-
These messages are stored in *Queue Tables*.

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences[Sequences]

AN *SQL Translator* converts a non-Oracle SQL dialect to SQL Statements that are understood by Oracle.

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/partitions[Table partitions]

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/triggers[Triggers]

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[Views]

A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/clusters[cluster] is an object that stores data from one or more → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables]

→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/contexts[Context]

{ Data dictionary

  Oracle stores information about database objects in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary.

  A list of all objects is found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects[`dba_objects`].
  -
  Invalid objects are listed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/invalid_objects[`dba_invalid_objects`]


}
{ Privileges

  In order for users to be able to access an Object, they must be → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[granted] the respective privileges.

  The matrix of grants and objects can be queried through the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] views
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[`dba_tab_privs`, `all_tab_privs` and `user_tab_privs`].

}
sa:

  Definitions of an object can be extracted as → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statements] or → development/XML/DOM/nodes/document[XML documents] using the
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata[`dbms_metadata`] package.
  -
  Metadata of Oracle objects can be described in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata_diff#dbms_metadata_diff-SXML[SXML].

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utldtree_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utldtree.sql`] creates tables and views that show dependencies between objects.

  Renaming objects (tables, views, sequences and private synonyms) with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/rename[SQL verb `rename`].

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statement] to (re-)create an object can be obtained with
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata/api/get/ddl[`dbms_metadata.get_ddl`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility/name_resolve[`dbms_utility.name_resolve`]

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ind/columns/columns-of-index[Show columns of an index]

  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand/ExecuteNonQuery#odac-OracleCommand-ExecuteNonQuery-install-db-obj[Installing database objects] with
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand/ExecuteNonQuery[`ExecuteNonQuery()`] of
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand[`Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleCommand`].
  
  Manipulation of Objects can be tracked with
  SQL execution can be tracked with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[auditing].
