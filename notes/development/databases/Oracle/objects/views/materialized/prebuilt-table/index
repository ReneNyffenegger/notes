$ Oracle: materialized views / prebuilt tables

There are two situations where creating → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized[materialized views] on *prebuilt tables* might be useful:
  • A table was created with a select statement that was very resource intensive. So, the developer might then choose to create a materialized view with the same query *and* the created table in order to forego the expensive operation again
  • A developer might choose to suspend using a materialized view and drop it with `drop materialized view … preserve table` and then later use that preserved table as a prebuilt table for a «new» materialized view.
