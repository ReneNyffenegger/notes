{ Updatable views #ora-updatable-view

  An *updatable view* allows *DML statements*.

  If the view's `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` must not have one of the following SQL operators or constructs to be updatable:
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators[Set operators] (`→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union`, `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/minus` etc.)
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/distinct`
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate functions] (such as `count` etc.) / `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` clause
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/analytic[Analytic functions]
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by`
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model[Model clause]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/hierarchical-queries/start-with_connect-by[`start with`, `connect by`] clauses
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery[Subqueries] in the select list

  In addition, some types of joins also make a view unupdatable.

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery#ora-sq-inline-view[Inline views]

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/views[`dba_views`]

  An SQL statement that references views can be transformed into a statement with the identical meaning, but without referencing any views
  (or → development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms[synonyms] for that matter) with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility/api/expand_sql_text[`dbms_utility.expand_sql_text`].

  A view cannot select from itself, trying to create such a view results in → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01731_circular-view-definition-encountered.

  → development/databases/Oracle/objects

  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-04063_view-xyz-has-errors
