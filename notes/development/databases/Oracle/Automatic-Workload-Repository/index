The *Automatic Workload Repository* (AWR) is a repository of historical performance data that includes cumulative statistics for
  • the system,
  • sessions,
  • individual → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements],
  • segments and
  • services.

These statistics are collected and evaluated in order to detect problems and self-tune the database.

{ Collected performance statistics

  The collected statistics include:
    • Access and usage statistics of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[segments]
    • Activity usages («time model statistics»), as found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sys_time_model[`v$sys_time_model`] and → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sess/time_model[`v$sess_time_model`].
    • System and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session related statistics as found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sysstat[`v$sysstat`] and → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sesstat[`v$sesstat`]
    • The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] that use lots of system resource or take long to finish
    • → development/databases/Oracle/Active-Session-History

}

{ AWR Snapshot

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance stores performance data in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/MMON[`MMON`] background process regularly (by default: hourly) processes the collected data and creates an *AWR Snapshot*.
  Thus, an AWR snapshot contains the performance metrics for a time period.

  These snapshots are then written into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX[`SYSAUX` tablespace].

  { Find snasphots #ora-awr-find-snasphots

   `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist/snapshot` allows to find snapshots (taken in a given period)
    gh|oracle_scriptlets|/ash-awr/awr/find_snap_ids.sql||

  }

}
{ AWR baseline

  An AWR baseline is a set of performance metric values. Usually, these are determined when a system performs without problems. They can then be used to compare the metrics in times when a System does not seem to perform very well.

}
{ Automatic Database Monitor (ADDM)

  The *Automatic Database Monitor* uses the captured statistics to automatically and proactively find possible performance problems.

  ADDM can be run manually, if needed.
