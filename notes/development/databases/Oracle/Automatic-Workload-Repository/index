The *Automatic Workload Repository* (AWR) is a repository of historical performance data that includes cumulative statistics for
  • the system,
  • sessions,
  • individual SQL statements,
  • segments and
  • services.

The AWR can be used for problem detection and self-tuning purposes.

ADDM can use this data to analyze performance problems.
