The *Automatic Workload Repository* (AWR) is a repository of historical performance data that includes cumulative statistics for
  • the system,
  • sessions,
  • individual SQL statements,
  • segments and
  • services.

The AWR can be used for problem detection and self-tuning purposes.


{ AWR Snapshot

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance stores performance data in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/MMON[`MMON`] background process regularly (by default: hourly) processes the collected data and creates an *AWR Snapshot*.
  Thus, an AWR snapshot contains the performance metrics for a time period.

  These snapshots are then written into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX[`SYSAUX tablespace].


}
{ AWR baseline

  An AWR baseline is a set of performance metric values. Usually, these are determined when a system performs without problems. They can then be used to compare the metrics in times when a System does not seem to perform very well.

}
{ Automatic Database Monitor (ADDM)

  The *Automatic Database Monitor* uses the captured statistics to automatically and proactively find possible performance problems.

  ADDM can be run manually, if needed.

  Don't confuse the AWR with the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository[ADR]

  AWR data is essential and for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/performance-tuning[performance tuning] of a database.
