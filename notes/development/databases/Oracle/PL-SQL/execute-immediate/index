$ Oracle PL/SQL: execute immediate
@ execute immediate

`execute immediate` can be used to dynamically execute an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement] that is stored in a variable or a string.

{ into

  The `into` clause → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[selects] values *into* variables:

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/into.plsql||

}
{ using out

  `using out` transfers data that is evaluated in an execute immediate statement out to variables:

  Example 1:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/using_out.plsql||

  Example 2:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/using_out_2.plsql||

}
{ into rowtype

  Instead of listing each individual variable separatly, the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/record#ora-record-rowtype[`%rowtype`] idiom can be used to select all values of a row:

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/into_rowtype.plsql||

}
{ using in out

  With `using in out`, it is possible to transfer values into and out from an `execute immediate` statement. Thus, it combines `into` and `using out`.

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/using_in_out.plsql||

}
{ using in out nested type extend

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/using_in_out_nested_type_extend.plsql||

}
{ using out (nesteed type)

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/PL-SQL/execute_immediate/using_out_nested_type.plsql||

}
{ select statements

  In order for a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select`] statement to be executed with `execute immediate`, at least on of the *into clause* or *bulk collect into clause* must be specifed.
  -
  Thus, the following statement does not increase the sequence `tq84_seq` because the select statement is not exectued:
code {
begin
   execute immediate 'select → development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences[tq84_seq].nextval from dual';
end;
/
code }

}

sa:

  In a stored procedure that is defined with `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/authid definer`, exectuting an 
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/session-system-control/alter-session/current_schema[`alter session set current_schema = …`] with `execute immediate`
  does not affect the scope in which `execute immediate` is executed, but it does if the procedure is defined with `authid current_schema`,
  see → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/authid#authod-exec-immediate[this example] and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session/alter/set/current_schema/execute-immediate[this research]).

  The → development/databases/SQL-Server[SQL Server] equivalent of `execute immediate` is → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_executesql[`sp_executesql`].
