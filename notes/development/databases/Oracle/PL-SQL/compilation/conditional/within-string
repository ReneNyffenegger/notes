$ PL/SQL preprocessor directives within strings

The â†’ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/compilation/conditional[PL/SQL preprocessor] does not parse preprocessor directives if they're located in a string, which can be demonstrated with the
following simple procedure:
code {
create or replace procedure tq84_cond_text authid definer as
begin
   dbms_output.put_line(q'[
   $if true $then
      1
   $else
      0
   $end
   ]');
end;
/
code }

When executed, the procedure prints:
code {
SQL> exec tq84_cond_text;
 
   $if true $then
      1
   $else
      0
   $end
code }
