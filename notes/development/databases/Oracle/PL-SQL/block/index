$ PL/SQL: block

A *block* is a fundamental construct in → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL: among others, they're used to
   • declare variables
   • embed statements
   • exception handling


A block consists of:
table { lll
  label ☰ optional ☰
  declare section ☰ optional ☰ Used to declare variables, constants, types etc. that are used in this block und embeded sub blocks. These declared items are not available in enclosing blocks.
  body ☰ required ☰ the executable part of the block contains a series of PL/SQL statements.
  exception handler ☰ optional ☰ technically part of the body: where execution is transferred to when an error occurs.
table }

Blocks can be nested: a block's *body* (and exception handler because they're part of the body) can contain any number of nested sub-blocks.


code {
<<tq84>>                             -- This block has the label TQ84
                                     --
declare                              -- The declare section. Here, it
   v1 number;                        --     declares the variable v1
                                     --
begin                                -- Start of the body.
   v1 := 7/3;                        --    The body contains the statements to
   dbms_output.put_line(v1);         --    be executed.
                                     --
exception                            -- Exception hander: used to
   when others then                  --    manage errors.
     dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm);  --    The exception handler consists of
     raise;                          --    statements as well.
end;                                 -- End of the block.  
code }

{ Exception handler

  After the exception handler is finished with execution, the next statment that is executed is the statement that follows the
  exception handler in its enclosing block.
  -
  If there is no enclosing block, execution is transferred to the invoker or the host environment.

  { sqlerrm and sqlcode

    Two noteworthy functions to be used in the exception handler are
      • → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[`sqlerrm`] and
      • → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[`sqlcode`]

    Outside of an exception handler, these function return `0` and `ORA-0000`, respectively. In → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements], `sqlerrm` and `sqlcode`
    are not recognized.
