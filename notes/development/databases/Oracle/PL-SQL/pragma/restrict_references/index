$ Oracle PL/SQL: PRAGMA RESTRICT_REFERENCES

The pragma → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/pragma/restrict_references[`restrict_references`] allows to make sure that a function or procedure
does not read or write from/to → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] or modify package variables.

Typically, this pragma is used for functions, although it can be applied to procedures as well.

This pragma is deprecated in favor of using → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic[deterministic] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure/parallel[parallel enabled] functions.
