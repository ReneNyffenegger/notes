$ Oracle: PL/SQL package JSN to assist in creation of JSON data

This package depends on → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/libs/personal/tim[`TIM`].

I have written this package before I familiarized myself with functions like
`json_scalar`,
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/array[`json_array`] or
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/object[`json_object`]. In hindsight, it seems that I should have
used functions like these rather than writing a package to manage JSON data.

  table { ll

     V0.2 ☰ make sur that `val(number)` returns a leading zero if in the range -1 … 1 (→ development/languages/JavaScript/JSON does not allow leading decimal points for numbers, but Oracle's `to_char()` returns a leading decimal point for number between -1 and 1).

  table }

}

  Other → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/libs/personal[simple PL/SQL packages] I've written over time.
