$ Oracle: PL/SQL package BLOB_WRAPPER

The PL/SQL package `blob_wrapper` is basically a wrapper around `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob`.
-
I *believe* I wrote this package around 2005 when I found it too tedious to write blobs to a file or read blobs from a file.

{ Functions and procedures

  table { ll
    `to_file` ☰ Write a blob to a file
    `from_file` ☰ Read a blob from a file (function and procedure)
    `substr` ☰
  table }

}

{ Write a BLOB into a file

  This is an example on how `blob_wrapper` can be used to write a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`blob`] into a file.

  This example creates an (ASCII) blob that contains a circle (made of 'X'es) whose radius is specified through the parameter radius. The circle is printed into a rectangle (made of spaceses)
  whose width and heigth are controlled through the parameter `out_width`. The blob is then written into a file whose name is specifed through the parameter file:

 *Note*: the resulting width and height can differ by 1 from the size passed. In the following case, I specify 400 for the width, but the resulting file will have 401 lines with 402 characters each (401 'X'es or ' 'es plus chr(10) as line terminator).

rem {
  First, a `blob` is created that consists of 400 lines with 400 characters each (`out_width`). The characters in the blob are either x'es or spaces, so that the x'es create a circle.
rem }

  Finally, the blob is written into a file (`blob_wrapper.to_file(…)`)

}
{ Read content from a file into a blob

  This is an example on how `blob_wrapper` can be used to read the content of a file into a blob. (`blob_wrapper.from_file`).

  The file that was created with the first example (`circle.txt`) is read into a blob. If the size (i.e. length) of the blob is different from the epxected size, a warning is printed.

  Finally, the blob is written to a new file: `circle_new.txt`.

}
{ Read content from a file into a table

  This is an example to demonstrate how `blob_wrapper` can be used to read the content of a file into a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables.

rem {
  The file that is read into the table was created with this script
rem }

{ Write content of a table to a file

  This is an example on how `blob_wrapper` can be used to write the content of a blob in a table into a file.

  `blob_wrapper` is used in the example that demonstrates the → http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/blog/2005/november/22.html[creation of bitmaps (BMPs) with PL/SQL].
