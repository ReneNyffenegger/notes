$ Predefined collection types for Oracle PL/SQL

Two predefined → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types[collection types] for Oracle PL/SQL are
  • `sys.dbms_debug_vc2coll` and
  • `sys.ku$_vcnt`


{ Turning lists into tables

  Such collection types are useful to transpose a list of values into a table:
code {
select
   column_value as val
from
   sys.ku$_vcnt('one', 'two', 'three');
code }

}
{ DBMS_DEBUG_VC2COLL #dbms_debug_vc2coll

  The intended purpose of `dbms_debug_vc2coll` is to pass data back to the caller of `dbms_debug.execute` (See source of `dbmspb.sql`).

  The column name is `column_value`:

code {
select
   t.column_value
from
   sys.dbms_debug_vc2coll('foo', 'bar', 'baz') t;
code }

}
{ KU$_VCNT

  `vcnt` stands for *varchar2 nested table* and is a `table of varchar2(4000)`.

  `ku$_vcnt` also has a *public → development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms[synonym]* so that it is not required to prefix with `sys`:
code {
select
   column_value as val
from
   ku$_vcnt('one', 'two', 'three');
code }

  Apparently, there is supposed to be a type named `ku$_vcntbig` which stores `varchar2(32000)`, but I was unable to locate it.
