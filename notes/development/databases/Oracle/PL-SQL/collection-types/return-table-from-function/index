$ Oracle: return a »table« from a function

With → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types[collections] and the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/table function, a function can return a table that can be queried in an
SQL statement. This is demonstrated in the following example.

{ Record type

  First, we need to create a *record type*. In this example, the records consist of two attributes: `i`, a number and `n`, a varchar2.

  The record type is created with `create type`:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/CollectionTypes/return-table-from-function/create-record-type.sql||

}
{ Table type

  Based on the record type, we can now create a table type.

  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/CollectionTypes/return-table-from-function/create-table-type.sql||

}
{ Function

  With the table type, we're ready to create a function.

  Note: the function returns a `t_table`.

  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/CollectionTypes/return-table-from-function/create-function.sql||

}
{ Using the function

  In order to use the function's returned value as a table in a SQL statement, we have to enclose
  the function within the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/table statement. From the SQL's perspective, the `table(…)` construct
  behaves as though it were an actual table.

}
{ Using bulk collect

  The previous function is rather boring in that it returns the same result set each time it is
  called.

  The following function makes that a bit more dynamic. It takes a paramter that specifies
  the maximum count of records to be returned.

  Then, it uses `rownum` and `bulk collect` to select a result set into a variable of type `t_table`
  and returns it.

}
{ Using the function

  Again, this function is used with the `table(…)` construct:

  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/CollectionTypes/return-table-from-function/select-from-function-2.sql||

}
{ Cleaning up

  Dropping the functions and record types to clean up:
