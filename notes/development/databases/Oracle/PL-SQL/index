@ PL/SQL

PL/SQL is → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle's] implementation of the → misc/ISO/9075/features[SQL standard feature] B128 (Routine language SQL).

→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types

→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate[`execute immediate 'sql text'`] allows to execute *dynamic* → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] from PL/SQL.

→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utlrp_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql`] recompiles all existing PL/SQL modules that were previously in an INVALID state, such as packages, procedures, and types.

sa:
  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/dplsql_bsq[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/dplsql.bsq`] creates PL/SQL related dynamic performance tables such as
 `procedure$`, `source$`, `idl_char$`, `idl_ub2$`, …

  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/statements/loop[Loop statements]

  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/inline

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/describe[`dbms_describe`] provides information about a PL/SQL object.

  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/compilation/conditional[Conditional compilation]

  The source code of PL/SQL objects can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/source[`all_source`]. Errors
  from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/errors[`all_errors`]. See also → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/errors-warnings[errors and warnings] in PL/SQL.

  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/PL-Scope collects information about *identifiers* and SQL statements in PL/SQL source code.

  It's possible to declare PL/SQL procedures and functions for the scope of an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement with the
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with.

  PL/SQL code can be obfuscated with → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin/wrap[`$ORACLE_HOME/bin/wrap`].
