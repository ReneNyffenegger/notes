$ Oracle PL/SQL: RECORD

A record is a tuble with a predefined number of named *fields* each of which has a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data type] that is
independant from that of other fields.
-
Thus, a record is fundamentally different from → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types[collection types] that stores zero, one or more elements of the
*same data type*.

When a record variable is initialized, the initial value of each field is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`] unless a different initial value was declared for it when
the record type was defined.

{ Creating records

  There are three ways to create a `record` type:
    • `record` type
    • `%rowtype`
    • `%type`

  It is not possible to create a record type at schema level.

  { Default values

code {
declare
   type rec is record (
      fld_one varchar2(10) default 'foo',
      fld_two varchar2(10) default 'bar
      …',
    );
    …
code }

  }
  { %rowtype #ora-record-rowtype

    `%rowtype` can be used to create a record type that represents a row in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table].
code {
declare
   tab_rec tab%rowtype;
   …
code }

   `%rowtype` can also be used to create a record that matches the fields in a *cursor*:
code {
declare
   cursor cur_xyz is select … from tab;

   rec_cur cur_xyz%rowtype
   …
code }

  }

}
{ Assigning null to a record variable

  Assigning `null` to a record variable sets all its fields to `null`.

}
{ Collections

? It is possible for a record-field to contain a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types[collection type].
