$ Oracle: Pipelined PL/SQL functions

Pipelined → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure[functions] are useful to query «virtual» tables or to return data that can not be formulated easily with SQL (Pivot queries come to mind…)

{ Simple demonstration

  The first step is to create a type that defines the names and data types (attributes) of the returned
  columns:
code {
create or replace type tq84_pipeline_columns as object (
   num  number,
   txt  varchar2(10),
   dat  date
)
/
code }

  This type is used to create a table-table:
code {
create or replace type tq84_pipeline_table as table of tq84_pipeline_columns
/
code }

  The function returns the table type and is declared `PIPELINED`:
code {
create or replace function tq84_pipeline_func(nofRecords in integer)
   return      tq84_pipeline_table
   PIPELINED
as begin
  for r in 1..nofRecords loop
       pipe row (
            tq84_pipeline_columns(
                 r,
                 to_char(r, 'fmRN'), -- Roman numerals (use fm to trim leading white space)
                 sysdate - r
            ));
   end loop;
end tq84_pipeline_func;
/
code }

  With this function, we can query an arbitrary number of records whose data is
  created by the PL/SQL function in memory.
  -
  Before Oracle 12c, the name of the function needed to be enclosed in a `table(…)` clause. Since 12c, this is optional.
code {
select * from table(tq84_pipeline_func(9));
code }

  Finally, we clean up the → development/databases/Oracle/objects[objects] we created:
code {
drop type     tq84_pipeline_table;
drop type     tq84_pipeline_columns;
drop function tq84_pipeline_func;
code }

}

  The so called → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types/return-table-from-function[table functions].

  Pipelined functions are unrelated to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/pipe/[`dbms_pipe`].
