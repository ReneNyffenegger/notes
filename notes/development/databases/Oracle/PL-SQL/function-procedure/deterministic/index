$ Oracle PL/SQL: Deterministic functions

code {
CREATE FUNCTION func_name … RETURN number DETERMINISTIC
AS
  ….
code }

A function that is declared deterministic asserts that a given combination of input-parameter values always returns the same value. However, Oracle does not verify this assertion.

A function is required to be deterministic if it used for a
  • function-based index
  • → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/virtual[virtual column] definition
  • from a query of a materialized view that is marked `refresh fast` or `eanble query rewrite`

Deterministic functions are especially useful when used in
  • `where` clauses
  • `order by` clauses
  • `group by` clauses
  • `map` or `order` methods of an SQL type
  • selection/criteria functions
  

{ Impact when used in WHERE clause

  The following example tries to demonstrate the impact of a deterministic function when used in a `where` clause of a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select statement].

  The → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL package contains two functions of which one is deterministic and the other is not. These functions produce the same result: they multiply the
  passed number by two.
  -
  A special feature of these functions is that they call → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lock/sleep[`dbms_lock.sleep`] to artificially prolongate the time spent in these functions.
  This will allow to roughly estimate how many times the function was called.

  This is the table on which we're going to query a record:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic/where-clause/tab.sql||

  Finally the select statements.
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic/where-clause/select.sql||

  The first select statement takes approximately three seconds because the table is queried in a full table scan and the non-deterministic function is called for each record during the scan.
  -
  However, the second select statement takes approximately one second because the function, by virtue of its determinacy, is called only once.

}
{ Caching of result

  The result of deterministic functions for a given combination of parameter values is cached within one *fetch* in a select statement. In each individual fetch, the result for a paramter-value
  combination is cached again and thus entails another function call.
  -
  This behaviour is demonstrated here.

  We need a log table to record each call of the deterministic function.

  After executing the previous select statement in SQL*Plus, the log table contains 187 (=11 Fetches with 17 calls to the function) records. (For a reason that I don't understand, when doing the same
  test in SQL Developer, I get 186 records only).
