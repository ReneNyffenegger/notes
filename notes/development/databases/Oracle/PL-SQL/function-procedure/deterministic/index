$ Oracle PL/SQL: Deterministic functions

{ Impact when used in WHERE clause

  The following example tries to demonstrate the impact of a deterministic function when used in a `where` clause of a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select statement].

  the following → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL package contains two functions of which one is deterministic and the other is not. These functions produce the same result: they multiply the
  passed number by two.
  -
  A special feature of these functions is that it calls → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lock/sleep[`dbms_lock.sleep`] to artificially prolongate the time spent in this function.
  This will allow to roughly estimate how many times the function was called.

  This is the table on which we're going to query a record:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic/where-clause/tab.sql||

  Finally the select statements.
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic/where-clause/select.sql||

  The first select statement takes approximately three seconds because the table is queried in a full table scan and the non-deterministic function is called for each record during the scan.
  -
  However, the second select statement takes approximately one second because the function, by virtue of its determinacy, is called only once.
