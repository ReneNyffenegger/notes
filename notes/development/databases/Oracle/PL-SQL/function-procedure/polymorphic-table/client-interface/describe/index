$ Oracle TPF Client Interface: describe function

The `describe` function is called by the Oracle's SQL engine to query the *row shape* (that is basically number of columns, their names and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types]) that
the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure/polymorphic-table[PTF] will return.

The arguments of the PTF and the `describe` function must be the same, but the `table` data type of the PTF replaced by the
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/tf/table_t[`dbms_tf.table_t`] descriptor type and the `columns` data type by the `dbms_tf.column_t` descriptor type.

The `describe` function can mark (input-) columns as *pass through* to indicate that they will be kept when producing the output.
-
Columns marked as *read* columns are used to compute values that are dependend on these read columns.

The columns that the PTF intends to return is returned by the `describe` function using a `dbms_tf.describe_t` descriptor.
-
If the PTF intends to pass on the same columns as the input table, `describe` can just return → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`].
