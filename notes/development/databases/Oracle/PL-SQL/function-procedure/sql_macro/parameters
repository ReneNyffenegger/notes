$ Oracle SQL macros: using function parameters

These examples try to outline some pecularities when using function parameters with → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro[Oracle's SQL macro functions].

{ Demonstration tables

  First, we need three tables, named `T`, `T0` and `T1`. Each table contains a text that identifies the table name:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro/parameters/create-table.sql||

}
{ Function randomTable

  The function `randomTable` returns a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select statement] that depending on the (alleged) current time selects from `T0` or `T1`.
  The statement also adds `compile_time` and `exec_time`:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro/parameters/random-table.sql||

}
{ Select from randomTable()

  If the SQL macro function `randomTable` is executed mutliple times, it turns out, that `compile_time` does not change and returns the time of when `randomTable()` was first called, however `exec_time`
  returns the time of the execution of the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement].

  The consequence of this behavior is also that the select statement does not change the table from which it selects, as naively expected.
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro/parameters/random-table-select.sql||

}
{ Function tabN

  Because `randomTable()` cannot be forced to change the select statement once it is defined, another approach is tried. The SQL macro function `tabN` has a parameter that is supposed to specify which table
  is selected from:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro/parameters/tabN.sql||

}
{ Select from tabN

  The behavior of the following `select` statement depends on the value of the initialization parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/cursor_sharing`.
  -
  If this value is `exact` (which it should ideally be), the value of the parameter *does* determine the table from which the function selects.
  -
  However, if the parameter's value is `force`, the passed value is silently disregared (i.e. becomes `null` in the function), and the function selects from `T`.

  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro/parameters/tabN-select-1.sql||

  The `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[dbms_output].put_line()` in the function can be used to show that the parameter `n` is always
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null`, irrespective of the actual value passed to the function (if the init parameter is `force`).

code {
tabN being called, n = 
code }

}
{ Using tabN in PL/SQL context

  The whole story with the parameters of macro functions gets even more interesting when using such macro functions in a
  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] context, as for example shown below:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/PL-SQL/function-procedure/sql_macro/parameters/tabN-anonymous-block.sql||

  In this case. the `for r in (select … from tabN(1)` selects from from `T1` and the `for r in (select … from tabN(2)` selects from `T0`.
  -
  But when passing the parameter via a function (`iterateWithVariable`), the function `tabN` selects from `T` again. This is because in this case, the parameter is passed as a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/bind-variables and the function
  cannot know which value it has - so the value of the parameter `n` is passed as `null`, as already seen earlier.

}
