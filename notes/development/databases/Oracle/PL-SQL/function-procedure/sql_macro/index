$ Oracle: SQL macros

{ Two types of SQL macros

  There are two types of SQL macros:
    • Table macros (available with 19c)
    • Scalar macros (available with 20c)
    
  Their main difference is that
    • table macros can *only* be used in the `from` clause while
    • scalar macros can *only* be applied in the `select` list or `where` clause of an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL] statement.
