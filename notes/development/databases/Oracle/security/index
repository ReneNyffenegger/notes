$ Oracle security

Oracle provides quite a few possibilities to enhance security:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[User accounts]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/security/authentication[Authentication]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/security/encryption[Encryption]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Options/advanced-security/Data-Redaction[Data Redaction]
  • Orientation (?)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Options/database-vault
  • → development/databases/Oracle/security/VPD[Virtual Private Database] (VPD). Oracle restricts returned records from a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statement] by adding a `where` condition. (See also `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/rls`)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Options/label-security[Label Security]
  • Data access monitoring (→ development/databases/Oracle/security/audit[auditing] and audit policies)
  • Real Application Security (which, unlike VPD, allows to declaratively formulate security policies so that no PL/SQL objects need to be maintained)

{ Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT)

  DBSAT is a command-line tool that helps identify and assess security risks. The tool is able to recommend changes in order to mitigate these risks.

  DBAT has three components:
  table { ll
    Collector ☰ Collects the raw data by executing SQL statements and OS commands
    Reporter ☰ Analyzes the collected data and produces the report with the findings.
    Disoverer ☰
  table }

  DBSAT consists of SQL and → development/languages/Python scripts and can by downloaded from MOS note 2138254.1.

}
{ Data Safe

 *Data Safe* is a cloud service which builds on DBSAT and provides
   • Security assessments (can be scheduled to run periodically)
   • Sensitive data discovery
   • Data masking
}
