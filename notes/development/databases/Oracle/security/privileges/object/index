$ Oracle: Object privileges

{ Show list of grantable object privileges #ora-obj-privs

  The list of grantable object privileges can be queried from the table `table_privilege_map` (which is created and populated by the
  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/dsec_bsq[`dsec.bsq`] script).

  Each privilege is associated with a numerical id (auditing number) which is also stored in this table.
code {
select
   privilege,  -- The numerical id of the privilege
   name
from
   sys.table_privilege_map
order by
   name;
code }

   A comment in `dsec.bsq` asks, if the `UPSERT` privilege is missing.

   Compare this result with the table → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system#ora-sys-privs[`system_privilege_map`] which lists
   the available → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[system privileges].

   See also the four records in `user_privilege_map` which stores the privileges
     • INHERIT PRIVILEGES
     • TRANSLATE SQL
     • INHERIT REMOTE PRIVILEGES
     • DEBUG CONNECT
