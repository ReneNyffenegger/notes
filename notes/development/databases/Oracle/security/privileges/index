$ Oracle privileges

A *privilege* gives a → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[user] or a → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles[role] the right to access an
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] or perform an activity. Thus, privileges play an important role
for → development/databases/Oracle/security[security].

There are two kinds of privileges:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[System privileges] (needed, for example, to execute `create user`, `create session` etc.)
  • Object privileges

Privileges can be given and taken away with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL[DCL] statements
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[`grant`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/revoke[`revoke`].

The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary views] that start with `ALL_` show
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects[objects] on which the querying user has privileges.

In addition, the data dictionary also features the following views which list privileges that a user has
table { ll
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/privs[`dba_role_privs`] ☰ Shows granted roles to other roles and users
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[`dba_tab_privs`] ☰ Lists which *object privileges* (such as `select` etc on tables or `execute` on packages) are granted to users and roles.
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/sys_privs[`dba_sys_privs`] ☰ Lists which *system privileges* (such as `create table`) are granted to users and roles.
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/role_privs[`role_role_privs`] ☰ Lists the roles that are granted to other roles (only roles to which the user has access are listed).
