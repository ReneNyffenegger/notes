$ Oracle privileges

A *privilege* gives a → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[user] or a → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles[role] the right to access an
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] or perform an activity. Thus, privileges play an important role
for → development/databases/Oracle/security[security].

There are two kinds of privileges:
  • → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[System privileges] (needed, for example, to execute `create user`, `create session` etc.)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/object[Object privileges] (needed, for example, to select data from tables, execute → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] etc.)

Privileges can be given and taken away with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL[DCL] statements
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[`grant`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/revoke[`revoke`].

{ Enabled privileges

  When a new → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session is started, the initial privileges to the connecting user are the combination of
    • those that are directly granted to the user and
    • those that are in the user's → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles/default[default roles]

  When connected, the user can change the enabled roles (and thus the enabled privileges) with the `set role` statement.

}
{ Data dictionary views

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary views] that start with `ALL_` show
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects[objects] on which the querying user has privileges.

  In addition, the data dictionary also features the following views which list privileges that a user has
  table { ll
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/privs[`dba_role_privs`] ☰ Shows granted roles to other roles and users
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[`dba_tab_privs`] ☰ Lists which *object privileges* (such as `select` etc on tables or `execute` on packages) are granted to users and roles.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/col/privs[`dba_col_privs`] ☰ Lists privileges on → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns].
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/sys_privs[`dba_sys_privs`] ☰ Lists which *system privileges* (such as `create table`) are granted to users and roles.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/role_privs[`role_role_privs`] ☰ Lists the roles that are granted to other roles (only roles to which the user has access are listed).
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/sys_privs[`role_sys_privs`] ☰ Lists which system privileges are assigned to the roles to which the current user has access.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/tab_privs[`role_tab_privs`] ☰ Lists which object privileges are assigned to the roles to which the current user has access.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/session/roles[`session_roles`] ☰ Lists all → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles[roles] that are enabled in the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/session/privs[`session_privs`] ☰ Lists all → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[system privileges]  that are enabled in the current session.

  { Selecting «granted role path»

    The following query selects all «granted-role-paths» from tables via roles to a user. Each path is selected in one record.

    The interesting tables are specified in `tabs`, the users in `usrs`.

  If a user tries to execute an SQL statement for which the necessary privileges are missing, the error
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01031_insufficient-privileges is thrown.

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/connect_role_grantees`

  → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges

  The package `dbms_privilege_capture` allows to analyse the usage of privileges granted to users. Such an analysis allows to revoke privileges that were not exercised.
