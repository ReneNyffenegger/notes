$ Oracle: Roles
@ roles

A role is a set of → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privileges] that has been given a name.

A role (unlike a → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users) is not an → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Oracle object].


{ Available roles

code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/roles;
code }

  Because roles have no owner, there is no `all_roles` or `user_roles` view.

  Roles that are enabled in the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session are listed in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/session/roles`.

}
{ Whom is a specific role granted to?

code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/role/privs[dba_role_privs] where granted_role = 'SPECIFIC_ROLE';
code }

}
{ Which table does a role have access to?

code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[dba_tab_privs] where grantee = 'SPECIFIC_ROLE';
code }

}
{ SYS_CONTEXT('sys_session_roles', …) #ora-role-sys_context-sys_session_roles

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/sys_context[sys_context]('sys_session_roles', role_name)` returns either `TRUE` or `FALSE` to indiciate if a given role (`role_name`) is enabled
  in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session.

code {
select
   role,
   sys_context('sys_session_roles', role) has_role,
   → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles/oracle-maintained[oracle_maintained]
from
   dba_roles
order by
   has_role desc,
   role;
