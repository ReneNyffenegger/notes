$ Oracle: Virtual Private Database

{ Simple demonstration

  { Define SQL*Plus/sqlcl variables

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/define dbService=localhost:1521/ora21
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/define sysPw=elCarosSecret
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/define tablespaceName=users
code }

  }
  { Create users

    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/create/users.sql||

  }
  { Create tables

    In this example, it is assumed that a company consists of different
    departments (with each having an entry in the `departments` table). An
    employee belongs to exactly one department. A department can have secrets
    that go into the `department_secrets` table.

    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/create/tables.sql||

    Insert some data into the tables (of which the data in `department_secrets` is confidential and private to the associated department):
    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/insert-data.sql||

  }
  { Create the VPD/policy package

    For any employee, it must be possible to see all secrets of his department, but no secret of another department.

    In order to make that happen with Oracle, we need to create a package, a trigger, and set a policy.

    First, the package is created:
    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/create/vpd-package.sql||

  }
  { Create a logon trigger

    This trigger fires whenever someone logs on to the database. It finds the user's departement id (`dep_id`) and calls `set_dep_id` in the VPD package:
    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/create/trigger.sql||

  }
  { Add a policy to the sensitive table

    Finally, the policy is defined.

    The policy states which procedure is used to add a where clause part to the where clause if someone executes a select statement:
    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/create/policy.sql||

  }
  { Different users executing the same select statement:

    { Frank
      Frank (belonging to R+D) executes a query:
      gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/frank.sql||
    }
    { Julia
      Julia (belonging to HR) executes a query:
      gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/julia.sql||
    }
    { Peter
      Peter (belonging to Sales) executes a query:
      gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/peter.sql||
    }

  }
  { Cleaning up

    gh|Oracle-demo-virtual-private-database|/cleanup.sql||
  
  }

}

  A user that is granted the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system is exempt from VPD (and also Oracle Label Security) policy enforcement.
