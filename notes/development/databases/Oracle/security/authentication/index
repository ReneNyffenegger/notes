$ Oracle authentication

In order to be able to connect to a database, a user must provide a user name and authentication credentials.
The credential might be one of
  • → development/security/password
  • A → development/security/kerberos[Kerberos] ticket
  • A public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate.

Oracle supports mulitple authentication methods, including:
  • Authentication by the database
  • Authentication by the operating system

Even though a user successfully connect to a database, it is possible to further restrict what a user is allowed to do with *database access control*.
