{ Traditional vs Unified Auditing

  Oracle comes with two auditing variations:
    • Traditional audting
    • Unified auditing

  Traditional auditing allows to
    • Track → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[SQL execution] (who, when etc.)
    • Operations on a given → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object]

  The so called *unified audit trail* stores audit records that are generated in mutliple source
 (compare with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/unified_audit/record_format[`v$unified_audit_record_format`]):
    • Audit records (including SYS audit records) from unified audit policies and AUDIT settings
    • Fine grainded auditing (→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/fga[`dbms_fga`])
    • Oracle Database Real Application Security
    • Oracle Recovery Manager
    • Oracle Database Vault
    • Oracle Label Security
    • Oracle Machine Learning for SQL
    • Oracle Data Pump
    • Oracle SQL*Loader Direct Load
    • Oracle XML DB HTTP and FTP protocol messages

  Unified auditing was introduced in Oracle 12c, traditional auditing is deprecated with Oracle 21c.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/option[`v$option`] can be queried to determine if unified auditing is enabled:
code {
select value from v$option where parameter = 'Unified Auditing';
code }

  In order to make transition from traditional to unified auditing easier, there is a so called *mixed mode audit facility* with which traditional audting can be used alongside 
  unified audting.
