$ Oracle Option: Real Application Clusters (RAC)
@ RAC

RAC is the computer cluster version of → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle Database]: Multiple
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instances] share the same (shared)
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database]. The instances are
connected by an *interconnect*.


Reasons to use RAC are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability (fault tolerance)
  • Scalability (on demand, additional nodes can be added to the cluster (Grid plug and play))

RAC requires *Oracle Clusterware*
