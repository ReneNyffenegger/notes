$ Oracle Option: Real Application Clusters (RAC)
@ RAC

RAC is the computer cluster version of → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle Database]: Multiple
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instances] share the same (shared)
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database]. The instances are
connected by an *interconnect*.


Reasons to use RAC are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability (fault tolerance)
  • Scalability (on demand, additional nodes can be added to the cluster (Grid plug and play))

RAC requires *Oracle Clusterware*

{ ADR

   In a RAC environment, each participating → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance and ASM have their own → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository[ADR] home.

}

sa:

 → development/databases/Oracle/Options/RAC-one-node

 → development/databases/Oracle/Options 

 Dictionary views for RAC are created with → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catclust_sql[`catclust.sql`]

 → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views#gv_views[`gv$` views].
