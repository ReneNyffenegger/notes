$ Oracle Option: Real Application Clusters (RAC)
@ RAC

RAC is the computer cluster version of → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle Database]: Multiple
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instances] share the same (shared)
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database]. The instances are
connected by an *interconnect*.

Reasons to use RAC are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability (fault tolerance)
  • Scalability (on demand, additional nodes can be added to the cluster (Grid plug and play))

RAC requires *Oracle Clusterware*

{ ADR

   In a RAC environment, each participating → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance and ASM have their own → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository[ADR] home.

}
{ Checking if an instance is a RAC instance


  Is → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background `LMON` running:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/ps -ef | → Linux/shell/commands/grep lmon | grep $ORACLE_SID
code }

  Does → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus show *Real Application Clusters* in its banner when started up?

  Is the value of the init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/cluster/database` = `true` (note that during a maintenance period, the value may be `false` even though its a RAC instance).

  The following shell command checks if the RAC option is linked. If it does not return anything, it is not linked, otherwise, it prints `kcsm.o`:
code {
$  → development/GNU/toolchain/binutils/ar -t → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/lib/libknlopt_a | → Linux/shell/commands/grep kcsm.o
code }

}

sa:

 → development/databases/Oracle/Options/RAC-one-node

 → development/databases/Oracle/Options 

 Dictionary views for RAC are created with → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catclust_sql[`catclust.sql`]

 → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views#gv_views[`gv$` views].

 There is also the object type → development/databases/Oracle/objects/clusters[cluster] which must be distinguished from RAC.
