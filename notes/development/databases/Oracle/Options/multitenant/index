$ Oracle Option: Multitenant

Oracle Multitenant is the capability that allows database consolidation and provides additional abstraction layer. This feature was introduced with Oracle 12c.


In a Multitenant configuration, one Oracle database instance known as "container database" (CDB, `CDB$ROOT`) acts as a federated database system for a collection of up to 252 distinct portable collections of database objects,
referred to as "pluggable databases" (PDB), each appearing to an outside client as a regular non-CDB Oracle database.

The *seed database* (`PDB$SEED`) is used when creating a new PDB to seed the new database.

A *key benefit* of the mutlitenant architecture is that resources such as the CPU and memory can be shared across all PDBs.
-
Another benefit is that an upgrade can be executed once and the affects all PDBs.

{ Creating a PDB

  A PDB is created with the `create pluggable database` statement.
