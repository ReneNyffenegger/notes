$ Oracle Option: Multitenant

Oracle Multitenant is the capability that allows database consolidation and provides additional abstraction layer.

In a Multitenant configuration, one Oracle database instance known as "container database" (CDB) acts as a federated database system for a collection of up to 252 distinct portable collections of database objects,
referred to as "pluggable databases" (PDB), each appearing to an outside client as a regular non-CDB Oracle database.
