$ Oracle Option: Advanced Compression
@ Advanced Compression

Oracle Advanced Compression complements Enterprise Edition *basic table compression* feature with comprehensive data compression and Information Lifecycle Management capabilities,
including those specifically tailored to Oracle's engineered systems, like Oracle → development/databases/Oracle/Exadata.



Oracle advanced compression promises to
  • reduce the cost of data storage
  • improve performance

{ Compression algorithm

  { Database block level (Advanced Row Compression?)

    The *compression algorithm* replaces duplicate values within a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[database block] with a refernce to a *symbol table* in the same block which contains the actual (duplicated) value.

    The benefit of storing the symbol table in the same database block is that no IO costs are involved when resolving a reference.

    This strategy is assumes that OLTPs and datawarehouse applications have lot of duplicate values in a database block.

}
{ Heat maps

  A heat map records data modification times at row and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment level and access time at
  segment level.

? These statics can then be used to automaticaly compress and move data base using the declarative language of *automatic data optimization* (ADO).

}
{ Compress existing tables

  Existing table can be compress with
    • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/redefinition/`
    • `alter table … move row store compress advanced`
    • `alter table … row store compress advanced` (only data of future DML is compressed)

  { Estimating compression ratios

    Before compressing existing tables, it might be worthwile to estimate ther compression ratio with `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/compression` (also referred to as *compression advisor*).

  }

}
{ Flashback Data Archives

  Advanced Compression also optimizes storage requirements for history tables in
  → development/databases/Oracle/Features_Options_Management-Packs/Flashback/Logical-Features/data-archive[Flashback Data Archives]
  when using them to track transactional changes.
