$ Oracle Option: Database in-Memory
@ Database In-Memory


Oracle Database In-Memory is an in-memory, column-oriented data store.
It aims to improve the performance of analytic workloads without impacting the performance of transactions that continue to use Oracle's traditional row format in memory.

The product's performance comes through the in-memory, columnar compressed format and through the use of SIMD (Single Instruction processing Multiple Data values) vector processing.
