$ Oracle Data Redaction

There are three types of Data Redaction:
  • Full (data is completely hidden),
  • Partial (a phone number might be displayed as `+41 052/xxx xx xx`)
  • Random (a randomly generated value is returned to the application)

*Redaction policies* are managed with the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/redact[`dbms_redact`] package.

Oracle recommends to pair Data Redaction with
  • Oracle Audit Vault
  • Database Firewall
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Options/database-vault[Database Vault]

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/security[Oracle security] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/Options/advanced-security.
