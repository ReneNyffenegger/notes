  Data Pump stores exported data in an → development/databases/Oracle/objects/directories[(Oracle-)directory] (which is located on the Oracle serve) and imports data from such a directory.

  The default directory (if not specified otherwise) is `DATA_PUMP_DIR`. This directory is created by `dbms_datapump_utl.create_default_dir` (`→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catdph_sql`).
