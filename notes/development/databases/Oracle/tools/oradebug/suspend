$ oradebug suspend

`oradebug suspend` stops the execution of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session until it resumed again with `→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug resume`.
-
This method is an (unsupported) way to *not* → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter/index#ora-alter-system-end-session[kill a session] that uses lots of resources so that
other users can work faster.

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/setorapid …
oradebug suspend
code }

Of course, if the session/process holds a latch and is then supsended, the latch will not be given up until the suspension which could lead to quite serious problems.

sa:
  `→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug[oradebug] resume` (and `wakeup`?)
