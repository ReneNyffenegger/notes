eq                   filter to only fire an event when a == b
ne                   filter to only fire an event when a != b
gt                   filter to only fire an event when a > b
lt                   filter to only fire an event when a < b
ge                   filter to only fire an event when a >= b
le                   filter to only fire an event when a <= b
anybit               filter to only fire an event when (a & b) != 0
allbit               filter to only fire an event when (a & b) == b
nobit                filter to only fire an event when (a & b) == 0
bet                  filter to only fire an event when b <= a <= c
nbet                 filter to only fire an event when a < b or a > c
in                   filter to only fire an event when a is equal to any b .. p
nin                  filter to only fire an event when a is not equal to any b .. p
streq                filter to only fire an event when string s1 = s2 (up to <len> characters)
