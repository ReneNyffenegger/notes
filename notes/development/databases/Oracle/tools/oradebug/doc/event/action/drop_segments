$ oradebug action: drop_segments

The following command drops the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/temporary[temporary segments] in the tablespace whose id/number is `n-1` (MOS Note 1495163.1):
code {
alter session set events 'immediate trace name drop_segments level n`
code }

This event is intended to be used if → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/SMON misses the post (?) and thus does not clean up temporary segments.
