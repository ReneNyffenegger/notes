$ oradebug dump pga_detail_get

`oradebug dump pga_detail_get` populates → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/process/memory/detail[`v$process_memory_detail`] which shows
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA related memory information.

First, the PID of the process whose memory needs to be analyzed must be found in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session:
code {
select
   prc.pid
from
   v$session ses join
   v$process prc on ses.paddr = prc.addr
where
   ses.sid = userenv('sid');
code }

Then, a user with → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system/sys/dba[sysdba] privileges must dump the PGA information:
code {
oradebug setmypid
oradebug dump pga_detail_get 61
code }
