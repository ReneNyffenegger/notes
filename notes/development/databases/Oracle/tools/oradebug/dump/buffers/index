`oradebug dump buffers` writes information related to the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache into a
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[trace file]:
code {

code }

`<lvl>` is a number that specifies the amount of infomation:
table { ll
  `1` ☰ Buffer header of each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block in the header (compare with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/bh[`v$bh`])
  `2` ☰ Include cache and transaction header of blocks
  `3` ☰ Full dump of each block
  `4` ☰ Each block's working set lists, buffer headers and cache headers 
  `5` ☰ Each block's transaction header
  `6` ☰ Full dump of each block (Same as `3`?)
