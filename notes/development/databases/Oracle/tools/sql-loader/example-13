$ Oracle: SQL Loader - Example 13: make a unique index unusable

{ Creating the table

  A table with a primary key is created and populated with three records:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_13_make-unique-indexes-unusable/create_table.sql||

}
{ Data to be loaded

  This is the data to be populated into the table.
  -
  Note: it contains `id=2`, which was already inserted into the table.

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_13_make-unique-indexes-unusable/tab_with_pk.dat||

}
{ The control file

  This is the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader/control-file[control file] to load the table.

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_13_make-unique-indexes-unusable/tab_with_pk.ctl||

  The control file uses `direct=true` and `unrecoverable`. So, Oracle does not verify the unique indexes while the data is loaded.

}
{ Data loaded

`select * from tq84_tab_with_pk order by id` finds that the table now contains two records whose id is 2.

}
{ Unusable index

  Since the unique constraint is now violated Oracle sets the index to *unusable*:
code {
select status from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/indexes[user_indexes] where index_name = 'TQ84_TAB_PK';
code }

}
