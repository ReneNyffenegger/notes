$ Oracle: SQL Loader Express: Struggling with optionally_enclosed_by on Windows

It turns out, that it is quite a struggle to use → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader[SQL Loader express] on → Windows in cojunction with the
`optionally_enclosed_by` parameter.
-
The following is the test case that I used to figure out how it is possible to specify *optional double quotes* (in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], that is).

First, I needed to create a table into which I wanted to load the data:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex-express-optionally_enclosed_by/create_table.sql||

Then, I also needed a file with the data to be loaded. Note the second line that contains the double quotes:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex-express-optionally_enclosed_by/some.dat||

Finally, the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file] to load the data.
-
The important thing was that I used the `optionally_enclosed_by` parameter last in the batch file. If it was followed by another
parameter, the load would not succeed.
