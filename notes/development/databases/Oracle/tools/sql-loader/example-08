$ Oracle: SQL Loader Example: Load CSV with a header and data that contains commas

The following example tries to load the following → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV file:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_08/load_8.csv||

Two features of the CSV file are its header and that it contains data with commas which are embedded in quotes (`"foo,bar,baz"` and `"one,two,three"`).

In order to load the data, we need to create a destination → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_08/create_table.sql||

The control file to load this data looks as follows.
-
SQL loader is instructed to skip the first line (the header) with `options(skip=1)`.
-
Strings within in quotes are recognized with the `optionially enclosed by '"'` instruction.
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_08/load_8.ctl||

Within SQL*Plus, the data can be loaded with this SQL script:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_08/all.sql||
