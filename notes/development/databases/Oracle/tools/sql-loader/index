$ Oracle: SQL Loader
@ SQL*Loader

SQL*Loader is used to load data from external files (such as → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV[CSV] files) into a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table].
-
These external files are called *data files*. They must not be confused with → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[database data files].

{ SQL*Loader vs Data Pump

  SQL*Loader is great at importing → development/Data into a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database]. However, it does not
  manage → development/Data/metadata very well and is not really usable to move data and/or table definitions from one database to another. These kind of tasks
  are much better handled by Data Pump.

{ SQL*Loader express mode

  *SQL loader express mode* is activated with the `TABLE` parameter.
