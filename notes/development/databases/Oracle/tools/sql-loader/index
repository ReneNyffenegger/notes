$ Oracle: SQL Loader
@ SQL*Loader

SQL*Loader is used to load data from external files (such as → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV[CSV] files) into a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table].
-
These external files are called *data files*. They must not be confused with → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[database data files].

{ SQL*Loader vs Data Pump

  SQL*Loader is great at importing → development/Data into a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database]. However, it does not
  manage → development/Data/metadata very well and is not really usable to move data and/or table definitions from one database to another. These kind of tasks
  are much better handled by Data Pump.

}
{ Control file

  The control file is read by SQL Loader and contains information such as
    • the location of the input file
    • data formats in the input file
    • error handling
    • memory instructions
    • etc.

  Text in the control file can be commented with two dashes (`--`).

}
{ SQL*Loader express mode

  In *SQL Loader express mode*, no control file is needed.

  Express mode is activated with the `TABLE` parameter:
code {
sqlldr user/password@db table=tab_xyz
code }

  SQL*Loader will then use the destination table (`tab_xyz`) structure to determine the input data's data types and columns.

}
{ Direct path loads

 → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert/paths[Direct path loads] are specified with
code {
sqlldr DIRECT=TRUE …
code }

  The database must be prepared for direct path loads by running
  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catldr_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catldr.sql`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader/control-file

  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/append/oracle/bulk-load[proc append] in → Companies-Products/SAS to bulk load data from SAS to Oracle.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl#sqlcl-sqldev-select-hints[SQLcl and SQL Developer select hint] `/*loader*/` causes an SQL result set to be returned in a format that is suitable for SQL*Loader.
