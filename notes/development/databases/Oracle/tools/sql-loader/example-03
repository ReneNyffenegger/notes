$ Oracle: SQL Loader Example: Selectively insert records according to a criteria

This example sort of uses a where condition (`when ... = ...`) to select the records that need to be loaded.

{ Create destination table

  Create the table that is to be filled:

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_03/create_table.sql||

}
{ Control file

  The control file specifies that only records need to be loaded whose 2nd field's value is fruit.

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_03/load_3.ctl||

}
{ The data file

  The name of this data file is specified with the `infile` statement in the control file.

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQLLoader/ex_03/load_3.dat||

}
{ Load the data

code {
$ sqlldr control=load_3.ctl userid=rene/password@ora.server.xy
code }

}
{ Discarded records

  One record didn't meet the load criterion. It is written into the discarded file `load_3.dsc`:

code {
Ford;Car;
code }

}
