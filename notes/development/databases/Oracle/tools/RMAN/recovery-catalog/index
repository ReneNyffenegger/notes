$ RMAN: recovery catalog
@ recovery catalog

→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN uses the *recovery catalog* to store
→ development/Data/metadata about databases needed for backups, restores and recoveries of databaes, such as
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data file] names (?)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo logs]
  • standby redo logs
  • temp files
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log
  • backup sets
  • image copies

The recovery catalog is only a copy of this information. The authorative data for → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/repository is kept in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database's]
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control.
-
If the control file is lost, the *recovery catalog* can step in to provide the necessary data that is required to restore and recover a database.

Additionally, the *recovery catalog* also stores records of archival backups and RMAN stored scripts that are used in conjuction with the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/target-database.

The data in the recovery catalog is stored in ordinary 
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/views. (In fact, it is stored in its own schema)

Using the recovery catalog is optional, however → development/databases/Oracle recommends it.
