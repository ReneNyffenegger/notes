@ media management software

During → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery[backup and recovery] and other operations,
RMAN needs to access (sequentially stored) → development/Data. This data is usually stored on tape devices. Such tape devices
are referred to as SBT (System Backup to Tape).
-
The *media management software* controls these SBTs and is used by RMAN as an interface for these SBTs.

When → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN needs the services of a → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/media-manager, a → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/channel needs to be
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/allocate[allocated].
