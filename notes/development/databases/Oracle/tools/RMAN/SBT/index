$ System Backup to Tape (SBT)
@ SBT

SBT offers a centralized tape backup management in an development/databases/Oracle / → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN environment.

An SBT device is typically a tape library or tape drive. These are controlled by the vendor's *media management software*.

The SBT interface allows → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN to back up and restore → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[database files] to and from
    • tape (almost every tape drive and library in SAN and → hardware/SCSI[SCSI] environments are supported)
    • internet-based Web Services such as Amazon S3.
