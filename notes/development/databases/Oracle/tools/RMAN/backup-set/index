$ RMAN: backup set
@ backup set

A backup set is a *logical structure* that contains the data of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[Oracle files] (
    → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data,
    → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control,
    → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files, → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/server-parameter-file).

A *backup set*  consists of one or more *physical* binary files in a  *proprietary → development/Data format* that is only readable and writable by → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN.
These files are referred to as → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set/piece[backup pieces].


A backup set is created with the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/backup[RMAN `backup` command].

→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy[Image copies] cannot be written into a *backup set*. They can only be written to disk.
