{ Recovery Appliance

  Recovery Appliance is the common name for the *cloud-scale Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance*.

  Recovery Appliance reduces data loss and backup overhead.

  Recovery Appliance reduces data loss with the following technologies
    • Real time redo transport: redo changes are continously transferred from the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA of a (protected) database to a Recovery Appliance)
    • Replication to remote Recovery Appliances
    • Automated tape backups made by the centralized Recovery Appliance
    • End-to-End database block validation


  Recovery Appliance scales to *many* (I mean: many) databases. 

  Recovery Appliance is integrated with RMAN.

  { Protection policy

    A protection policy defines a *recovery window goal*.

    These protection policies can the individually be assigned to the databases in an organization.

  }


}
{ Backup history

  RMAN maintains a repository of historical backup → development/Data/metadata in the control file of every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database] that it backs up.

  If desired, this history can also be stored in a *recovery catalog* in another database.
