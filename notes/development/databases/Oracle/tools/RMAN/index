$ Oracle RMAN
@ RMAN

*Oracle RMAN* is used to perform  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery.

RMAN is a feature. Hence, it does not need a separate installation.

RMAN is integrated with *Oracle Secure Backup (SBT)*.

RMAN (as well as SBT) are accessible from both the command line and → development/databases/Oracle/tools/Enterprise-Manager[OEM] Cloud Control

RMAN backups might be stored in the *fast recovery area*.

{ Backup history

  RMAN maintains a repository of historical backup → development/Data/metadata in the control file of every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database] that it backs up.

  If desired, this history can also be stored in a *recovery catalog* in another database.

}
