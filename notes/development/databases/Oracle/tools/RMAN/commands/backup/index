$ RMAN command: backup

{ Backup sets or copies

  The RMAN `backup` command creates either
    • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set[backup sets] or
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy[image copies]
    • proxy copy (?)

  An → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy is created with
code {
backup AS COPY databaes
code }

  Note: → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy[image copies] cannot be written into a → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set. Thus, when creating
  an *image copy*, the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure#rman-configure-device-type[default device type] must be disk.

}
{ Device #rman-backup-device-type

  Use a non default device type (which might be configured with → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure#rman-configure-device-type[`configure default device type`])

code {
backup DEVICE TYPE → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/SBT  database;
backup DEVICE TYPE DISK database;
code }

}
