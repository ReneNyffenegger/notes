$ RMAN channel
@ channel

An → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN channel is needed in order to perform → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN operations on a *media manager* (see → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/media-management-software)
The channel handles communication between RMAN and the (third party) media manager.
Such a channel is allocated with the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/allocate[RMAN command `allocate`].

? A channel is not needed if RMAN operates on a disk.


{ Channel types

  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN supports the two channel types
    • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/SBT
    • disk (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy[image copies])
}
{ RMAN commands

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure#rman-configure-channel[configure channel] device type disk maxpiecesize 2G;
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure#rman-configure-channel[configure channel] device type disk format /tmp/%u;
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/allocate channel chnl_1 device type disk;
code }

}
{ Format specifiers ( #rman-channel-format-specifier

  The format specifiers determine the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set/piece#rman-backup-piece-name[name of a backup piece].

code {
configure channel device type disk format '/u01/backup_df%t_s%s_s%p';
code }

  The format specifiers are introduced with a percent sign:
    • `%d` the name of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database
    • `%t` → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup time stamp (four characters?)
    • `%s` → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set number
    • `%p` → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set/piece number
    • `%U` can be used for most purposes in which case → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN creates a unique file name

}
{ ASM disk location

code {
configure channel device type disk format '+dgroup1';
code }

}
{ Parallel operations

  Ideally, there is one channel for each *tape drive* or *physical disk*.

code {
configure device type sbt parallelism 4;
code }

}
