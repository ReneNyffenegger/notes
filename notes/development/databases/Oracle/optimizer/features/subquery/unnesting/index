$ Oracle optimizer feature: subquery unnesting

The → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer uses *subquery unnesting* to transform an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement that contains a
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery into an SQL statement with an additional → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join to eliminate the subquery. 

Subquery unnesting is possible if
  • the resulting join statement is guaranteed to return the same rows as the original statement
  • the subquery does not have → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate functions]

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[`unnest` and `no_unnest` hints]
