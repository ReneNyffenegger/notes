{ Join view merging

 *Join view merging* is a special case of simple view merging.

}
{ Constructs preventing views from being merged

? Some constructs may prevent a view from being (simple-) merged.

  If the view contains constructs not inclued in *select-project-views*, such as
     • `group by` / aggregation functions
     • `distinct`
     • Outer join
     • `model`
     • `connect by`
     • Set operators

? If the view is placed on the right side of a semijoin or an antijoin.

? If the view has subqueries in the `select` list.

? If the outer query block contains PL/SQL functions.

? The view participates in an outer join, and does not meet one of the several additional validity requirements that determine whether the view can be merged.
