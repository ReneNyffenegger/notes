$ Oracle Optimizer
@ optimizer

When an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement] is submitted to Oracle, the optimizer evaluates different plans how this SQL statement might be executed.
For each plan, the optimizer estimates how much resources it needs to execute the statement. This resource estimation
is called *cost* of the plan. The optimizer then chooses the plan with the lowest cost.

An essential part of such a query optimization is to determine the order and methods with which → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join[joins] are executed.
-
The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[`leading` hint] can be used to influence the chosen order.

In order to estimate the costs, the optimizer needs → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[optimizer statistics].

The optimizer is sometimes also referred to by (its legacy name) *cost based optimizer* (CBO) to distinguish it from the *rule based optimizer* (RBO).


{ Influencing and supporting the optimizer

  The optimizer is influenced by
    • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/index[Initialization parameters]
    • Table and index → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering[statistics gathered] by → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[`dbms_stats`]
    • SQL profiles

{ Query transformations #ora-optimizer-qry-tran

  For achieving better → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plans], the optimizer might choose to *transform* a query.

  Available transformation techniques include
  table { ll
    OR-expansion ☰ `where tab.col_1 = 'foo' or tab.col_2 = 'bar'`  -> `where tab.col_1 = 'foo' … UNION ALL … where tab.col_2 = 'bar'`
    Simple view merging ☰ Merging *select-project-join* views
    Complex view merging ☰ Merging views that contain `group by` and `distinct` clauses
    Predicate pushing ☰ Push a predicate that is formulated on the outer query into the inner query.
    → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/features/subquery/unnesting[Subquery unnesting] ☰ Transform a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery into a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join operation.
    Query rewriting ☰ Use a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized to improve performance of a query
    Star tranformation ☰ Avoid full table scans of fact tables in a star schema.
    In-memory aggregation (vector group by) ☰
    Cursor duration temporary tables ☰ Temporarily store result of a query blocks that are used multiple times. See also the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[`with` clause]. 
    Table expansion ☰ See also the `expand_table` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[hint]
    Join factorization ☰  Factorize common computations from branches of a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[`union all`] query.
