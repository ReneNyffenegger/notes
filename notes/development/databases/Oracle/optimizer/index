$ Oracle optimizer
@ optimizer

When an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement] is submitted to Oracle, the optimizer evalutes different plans how this SQL statement might be executed.
For each plan, the optimizer estimates how much resources it needs to execute the statement. This resource estimation
is called *cost* of the plan. The optimizer then chooses the plan with the lowest cost.

In order to estimate the costs, the optimizer needs → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[optimizer statistics].

The optimizer is influenced by
  • → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/index[Initialization parameters]
  • Table and index statistics gathered by → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[`dbms_stats`]
  • SQL profiles
  • SQL plan management / stored outlines
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[SQL hints]

sa:
  `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/autotrace[set autotrace] on explain` in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus.

   → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[Events] 10053 and 10054.
