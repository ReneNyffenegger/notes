$ Oracle: Adaptive query optimization

Adaptive query optimization complements using → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[statistics] when generating an optimal plan to
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execute an SQL statement].

The two main areas of *adaptive query optimization* are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/adaptive[Adaptive SQL plans]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/adaptive[Adaptive statistics]

With *adaptive SQL plans*, the *statement executor* can adjust an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[SQL execution plan] at *run-time*. Areas where such adaptions are possible include
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/methods[join methods] (switch from a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/methods/hash[hash join] to a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/methods/nested-loop[nested loop join] or vice versa)
  • Parallel distribution methods
  • Bitmap pruning

Adaptive statistics deals with
  • Dynamic statistics
  • Automatic reoptimization
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/directive[SQL plan directives]

The optimizer chooses an adaptive plan when the SQL statement's → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join[joins] and predicates reach a level of
complexity that make an accurate cardinality estimation difficult if not impossible.
-
In such a case, the optimizer injects a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[`statistics collector` operation] into its chosen plan.

In order to see all operations of an adaptive plan with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display/cursor[`xplan.display_cursor`], the `format` parameter
must include `adaptive`:
code {
select * from table(dbms_xplan.display_cursor(format => 'adaptive'));
code }

Adaptive plan generation can be turned of using → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[`opt_param` hint] like so: `opt_param('_optimizer_adaptive_plans', 'false')`.
