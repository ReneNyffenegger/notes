$ Oracle optimizer statistics: Histograms
-

The main purpose of histograms is to enable the optimizer to estimate cardinalites for filter or join predicates applied on columns with skewed data.
-
For columns without histograms, the optimizer assumes the values to be uniformely distributed.

There are four types of histograms:
  • Freqency
  • Top frequency
  • Height balanced (legacy)
  • Hybrid
