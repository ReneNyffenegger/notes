$ Oracle: Online statistics gathering

Loading large amounts of → development/Data into a database might cause → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics to become stale. In the case of a
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/create/as-select[`create table … as select`] statement, there is even a new
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables for which there is no statistics available at all.
-
Therefore, after such *bulk operations*, the statistics of the modified objects should be updated.

With *online statistic gathering*, Oracle → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering[gathers] → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics automatically,
that is, without having to explicitely call → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[`dbms_stats`] for the following operations:
  • Creation of an → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[index]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert/paths[Direct path] `insert into … as select` (IAS) into empty → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables]

While online statistics gathering is limited to bulk operations, → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering/real-time[real-time statistics] gathers
data for conventional → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML operations.


sa:

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[execution plan operation] which performs online statistics gathering is
  → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering/online/optimizer-statistics-gathering[`OPTIMIZER STATISTICS GATHERING`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert/append-hint[`insert` statement with the `append` hint].
