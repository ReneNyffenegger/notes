$ Oracle: Dynamic Optimizer Statistics

When an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parsing#ora-hard-soft-parse[hard parsed] and the relevant
→ development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[statistics] are stale, missing or insufficient, Oracle scans a small portion («sample») of the underlying data to get
calculate *dynamic statistics* that can be used to generate an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[SQL execution plan].

{ Controlling behavior of dynamic statistics (Degree of sampling) #ora-dyn-sample-degree

  The behavior of gathering dynamic statistics can be controlled with a number that is specified with
    • the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter `optimizer_dynamic_sampling`], or
    • the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/dynamic_sampling` hint.

  These names contain «dynamic sampling» because in earlier releases (11g?), dynamic optimizer statistics was named *dynamic sampling*.

  This number is an integer between 0 and 11 with the following meaning:
  table { ll
    ~Level~ ☰ ~Description~
    0 ☰ Don't gather dynamic sample statistics
    1 ☰ Sample all tables that have not been analyzed if some conditions are true
    2 ☰ Apply dynamic sampling to all unanalyzed tables. The number of blocks sampled is two times the default number of dynamic sampling blocks.
    3 ☰ Apply dynamic sampling to all tables that meet Level 2 criteria, plus all tables for which standard selectivity estimation used a guess for some predicate that is a potential dynamic sampling predicate. The number of blocks sampled is the default number of dynamic sampling blocks. For unanalyzed tables, the number of blocks sampled is two times the default number of dynamic sampling blocks.
    4 ☰ Apply dynamic sampling to all tables that meet Level 3 criteria, plus all tables that have single-table predicates that reference 2 or more columns. The number of blocks sampled is the default number of dynamic sampling blocks. For unanalyzed tables, the number of blocks sampled is two times the default number of dynamic sampling blocks.
    5 - 9 ☰ Apply dynamic sampling to all tables that meet the previous level criteria using 2, 4, 8, 32, or 128 times the default number of dynamic sampling blocks respectively.
    10 ☰ Apply dynamic sampling to all tables that meet the level 9 criteria using all blocks in the table.
    11 ☰ Oracle uses other criteria (which exactly?) to determine if dynamic statistics will be collected
  table }

  The relevant conditions for level 1 are:
   • At least one table in the query is unanalyzed
   • The unanalyzed table is joined to another table or appears in a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery or *non-mergeable view*
   • The unanalyzed table has no indexes
   • The unanalyzed table has more blocks than the number of blocks that would be used for dynamic sampling of this table. The number of blocks sampled is the default number of dynamic sampling blocks (32).

}
{ Simple example

  First, we verify that the init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters` is set to the (default) value of 2:
code {
select
   value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter
where
   name = 'optimizer_dynamic_sampling';
code }
 
   We also create a table and fill it with some → development/Data/test/generate/Oracle[generated test data]. The value of `id` is unique (but not enforced with a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints:
code {
create table tq84_dyn_smp_tst (
   id   integer, -- primary key,
   val  number(7,2)
);
 
insert into tq84_dyn_smp_tst
select
   level,
   dbms_random.value(1000, 100000)
from
   dual connect by level <= 10000;

commit;
code }
  
  Because there are no table statistics for the table and the `optimizer_dynamic_sampling` is set to two, Oracle will use dynamic statistics in the following SQL statement:
code { 
explain plan for
select
   *
from
   tq84_dyn_smp_tst
where
   id = 1;
  
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(format=>'basic rows note');
--
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name             | Rows  |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- |   0 | → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/statement/select[SELECT STATEMENT]  |                  |     1 |
-- |   1 |  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_DYN_SMP_TST |     1 |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
--  
Note
-----
   - dynamic statistics used: dynamic sampling (level=2)
code }
  
  We now gather table statistics …
code {
begin
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats/api/gather/table_stats(user, 'tq84_dyn_smp_tst');
end;
/
code }
  
  … and inspect the new execution plan. This time, because there *are* statistics, Oracle will not dynamically sample the table again:
code {
explain plan for
select
   *
from
   tq84_dyn_smp_tst
where
   id = 1;
  
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(format=>'basic rows note');
--
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name             | Rows  |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- |   0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |                  |     1 |
-- |   1 |  TABLE ACCESS FULL| TQ84_DYN_SMP_TST |     1 |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
code }
 
  We change the value of `id` to 1 in each record (thus the `where id = 1` condition will essentially become meaningless):
code {
update tq84_dyn_smp_tst set id=1;
code }
 
  Again, the execution plan. Note that the plan, notably, the number of estimated rows, did not change:
  Oracle still thinks the query will return 1 row (which is of course wrong).
code {
explain plan for
select
   *
from
   tq84_dyn_smp_tst
where
   id = 1;
  
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(format=>'basic rows note');
--
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name             | Rows  |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- |   0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |                  |     1 |
-- |   1 |  TABLE ACCESS FULL| TQ84_DYN_SMP_TST |     1 |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
code }
 
  In order to force Oracle to use dynamic samples, we use the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/dynamic_sampling` hint.
  -
  Because dynamic sampling will be used, the number of returned rows is now correctly estimated to 10000:
code {
explain plan for
select /*+ dynamic_sampling(tq84_dyn_smp_tst 1) */
   *
from
   tq84_dyn_smp_tst
where
   id = 1;
  
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(format=>'basic rows note');
--
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name             | Rows  |
-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- |   0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |                  | 10000 |
-- |   1 |  TABLE ACCESS FULL| TQ84_DYN_SMP_TST | 10000 |
-- ------------------------------------------------------

code }

  Cleaning up
code {
drop table tq84_dyn_smp_tst;
code }

}
{ /* OPT_DYN_SAMP */ and /* DS_SVC */ comments

  When an SQL statement is executed with dynamic optimizer statistics, the statement is stored in the shared pool with one of the two comments (not → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[hints]) `/* OPT_DYN_SAMP */` or `/* DS_SVC */`.
  -
  These comments are → https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:12:::NO:RP:P12_QUESTION_ID,P12_PREV_PAGE:9534476300346475576,11[used by Oracle's optimizer team] to make it easier for them to identify
  such statements in the shared pool.

 `/* OPT_DYN_SAMP */` comments indicate that regular statistics were not sufficient to estimate a cardinality, or such statistics were even missing.

 `/* DS_SVC */` comments were used in 11gR2 and 12c.

  In Oracle 19c, there seems to also be comments like `/* SQL Analyze(181,0) */`.

}
{ TODO

  The following tests were conducted with the default value of `optimizer_dynamic_sampling` which is 2:
code {
select * from v$parameter where name in ('optimizer_dynamic_sampling');
code }

  A table is needed for the test:
code {
create table tq84_t(id number, val varchar2(10));
code }

  The table needs some data::
code {
insert into tq84_t
select
   mod(level,     3) *
   mod(level,     5) *
   mod(level,     7) *
   mod(level,    11) +
   mod(level, 10101),
  'xxx'
from
   dual connect by level <= 100000;
code }

  The insert statement didn't generate any sort of auto statistics, `num_rows` and `blocks` is reported as `null`:
code {
select
   num_rows,
   blocks
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tables[user_tables]
where
   table_name = 'TQ84_T';
code }

  There are 11 rows in the table whose `id` is `111`:
code {
select count(*) from tq84_t where id = 111;
code }

  Because of the missing statistics, the optimizer uses *dynamic statistics* (referred to as «dynamic sampling» in the note of the following output) when a simple `select` statement is explained.
  With dynamic sampling, the optimizer estimates the number of records with `id = 111` to be `4`:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain[explain plan] for
select * from tq84_t where id = 111;

select * from table(dbms_xplan.display);
--
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name   | Rows  | Bytes | Cost (%CPU)| Time     |
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- |   0 | → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/statement/select  |        |     4 |    80 |    68   (0)| 00:00:01 |
-- |*  1 |  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access[TABLE ACCESS] FULL| TQ84_T |     4 |    80 |    68   (0)| 00:00:01 |
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  
-  …
--  
-- Note
-- -----
--    - dynamic statistics used: dynamic sampling (level=2)
code }

  Gathering statistics for the table;
code {
begin
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats/api/gather/table_stats[dbms_stats.gather_table_stats](user, 'tq84_t');
end;
/
code }

  This time, explaining the plan for the same select statement shows that with gathered statistics, the estimation of returned rows is `10`, much better than before, but not correct. Also: the note
  of the previous plan about *dynamic statistics used* is gone:
code {
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Id  | Operation         | Name   | Rows  | Bytes | Cost (%CPU)| Time     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |        |    10 |    80 |    69   (2)| 00:00:01 |
|*  1 |  TABLE ACCESS FULL| TQ84_T |    10 |    80 |    69   (2)| 00:00:01 |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
code }

  When executing the query with the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/gather/plan_statistics` hint…
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/serveroutput off
select /*+ gather_plan_statistics */
   *
from tq84_t where id = 111;
code }

… we can use → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display/cursor[`dbms_xplan.display_cursor`] to show the actual values of that the query execution processed:
code {
select * from table(dbms_xplan.display_cursor(format => 'allstats last'));
--
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name   | Starts | E-Rows | A-Rows |   A-Time   | Buffers |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- |   0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |        |      1 |        |     11 |00:00:00.01 |     202 |
-- |*  1 |  TABLE ACCESS FULL| TQ84_T |      1 |     10 |     11 |00:00:00.01 |     202 |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code }

 `E-Rows` shows the *estimated rows* (= 10, as estimated in the execution plan), while `A-Rows` (= actual rows)
  shows the value of the actual rows.

  Note, I used `set serveroutput off` in order to prevent → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer] from executing the statement which reads the `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output` buffer which would have interfered
  with the last `dbms_output.display_cursor` statement.
