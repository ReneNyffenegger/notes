$ Oracle SQL: TO_CHAR
@ to_char

{ Inserting a literal character or string

  The following statement produces an ~ORA-01821: date format not recognized~ error:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select]
  to_char(sysdate, 'hh24 hr, mi min, ss sec')
from
  dual;
code }


  This is because some characters or strings that the statement tries to be literally inserted into the result must be quoted with double-quotes:
  The following statement produces an ~ORA-01821: date format not recognized~ error. The following works:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select]
  to_char(sysdate, 'hh24 "hr," mi "min," ss "sec"')
from
  dual;
code }

}
{ Spell numbers

code {
select
   to_char(to_date(level, 'J'), 'JSP') num
from
   dual
connect by
   level <= 100;
code }

}
