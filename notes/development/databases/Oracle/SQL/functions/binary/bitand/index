$ Oracle SQL function: BITAND

code {
select
   bitand(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/binary/bin_to_num(1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0),
          bin_to_num(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)) anded
from
   dual;
code }

There is no built-in `BITOR` function in Oracle; the or-value of two numbers `a` and `b` can be simulated with `a - bitand(a,b) + b`, for example for `33` and `5`:
code {
select
   33 - bitand(33, 5) + 5     orred
from
   dual;
code }

  The `bit_and_agg` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate function] (introduced in → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c).
