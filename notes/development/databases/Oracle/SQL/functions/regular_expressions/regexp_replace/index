$ Oracle SQL function: REGEXP_REPLACE
@ regexp_replace

`regexp_replace` is the the → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] variant of `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/text/replace`: The function replaces a portion of a text
that matches a → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] with another text. 

code {
regexp_replace( text , pattern [, replace_string [, position [, occurence [, → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/regular_expressions/parameters/match_param[match_param] ]]]] )
code }

table { ll
  `text` ☰
  `pattern` ☰ The regular expression that is applied on `text`. Cannot be longer than 512 bytes.
  `replace_string` ☰ The text with which the portion of the text that was matched by `pattern` is replaced with. Might contain back-references (`\1`) to groups defined in the `pattern`
  `position` ☰ The first position in `text` where `pattern` is looked for. *Note*: the characters up to that position are still returned by `regexp_replace`. Default is 1.
  `occurence` ☰ Which matched part of `text` will be replaced. `0` (which is the default) will replace all matched portions.
table }

{ Simple examples

  { Remove new lines

    The following statement replaces new lines with spaces:
code {
select
   regexp_replace(
'first line
second line
third line',
   chr(10),
   ' ')
from dual;
code }

  }

sa:

 `regexp_replace` is not a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic[deterministic] function. Thus, when using it in a
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/virtual[virtual column],
  a → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-54002_only-pure-functions-can-be-specified-in-a-virtual-column-expression#ora-54002-regexp_replace[ORA-54002: only pure functions can be specified in a virtual column expression]
  error is thrown.
