$ Oracle regular expressions: match_param

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/regular_expressions[Oracle regular epxression functions] come with a `match_param` parameter that allows to change
the default matching behaviour of these functions.

`match_param` can be any combination of the following letters:
  • `i` for case-insensitive matching
  • `c` for case-sensitive matching
  • `n` lets the dot (`.`) also match the → development/line-break[new line] character.
  • `m` treats the source text as a *multi line* text: `^` and `$` match not only at the beginning and end of the source text but also where new line characters occur in `text`
  • `x` ignores whitespace characters in the pattern. This is used for more readable patterns.

The default case-senstiveness is determined by `NLS_SORT`.
