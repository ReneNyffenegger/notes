→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/XML/Query[`XMLQuery`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/XML/Cast[`XMLCast`] are typically used in a `select` list.
-

→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/XML/Table[`XMLTable`] is typically used in a `where` clause.

{ XQuery: Operating on sequences of items

  An → development/XML/XQuery expression returns a sequence of items. Such a sequence can be evaluated in
 `XMLQuery` or `XMLTable`.

 `XMLQuery` constructs another xML document from the sequence while `XMLTable` turns the sequence into a virtual (SQL) table and returns a record for each item.
