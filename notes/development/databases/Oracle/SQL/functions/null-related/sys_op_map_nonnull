$ Oracle: SYS_OP_MAP_NONNULL
@ sys_op_map_nonnull

`sys_op_map_nonnull` is an *undocumented* function that allows to compare two expressions even if they invovle `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null` values.

The following example compares `col1` with `col2` and returns two records, the one where both, `col1` and `col2` are `null` and the one where both have the value `B`:
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/functions/null_related/sys_op_map_nonnull.sql||

Technically, the function returns a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[`raw…`]. This raw is built from the value that is passed to the function and then appending `hex(0)`. In case of `null`,
it returns `hex(255)`, without an added 0.

So, `sys_op_map_nonnull(null) = sys_op_map_nonnull(null)` factually compares `hex(255)` with `hex(255)`, which is true.
