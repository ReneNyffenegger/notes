{ TODO

  On environments, where `time_bucket` is not available, some (limited?) functionality of can be simulated with constructs like follows:
code {
select
   date '2000-01-01' + trunc( (sysdate - date '2000-01-01')*96)/96
from
   dual;
code }

  This statement rounds a date down to the nearest quarter hour.
