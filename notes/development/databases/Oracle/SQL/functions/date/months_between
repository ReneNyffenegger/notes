$ Oracle: MONTHS_BETWEEN
@ months_between

`months_between(dt_1, dt_2`) calculates the (fractional) number of months between the two dates `dt_1` and `dt_2`. The result is positive, if `dt_2` is earlier than `dt_1`.

The following statement returns 42:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select
   months_between(
      → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/add_months(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate, 42), -- The first parameter denotes a point in time after
                 → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate       -- the point in time specified with the second paramter:
   )                           -- the result is positive.
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

sa:
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/add_months`

  In order to get whole numbers, the result might be passed to `round()`, `ceil()` or `floor()`.
