$ Oracle: SYSDATE

`SYSDATE` evaluates to a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[date] that corresponds to the current date/time.

Thus, the following SQL statement will run quite for a long time and won't change the values of the first two columns:
code {
with x as (select /*+ materialize */ sysdate d from dual)
select
  x.d,
  sysdate,
  level
from
  x connect by x.d < sysdate + 1/86400;
code }
