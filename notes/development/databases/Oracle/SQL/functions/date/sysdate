$ Oracle: SYSDATE
@ sysdate

`SYSDATE` evaluates to a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[date] that corresponds to the current date/time.

{ Using SYSDATE in an SQL statement

  If used in an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement, the returned value won't change until the statement is finished, even if the execution of the statement takes longer than one second.

  In order to demonstrate this, I create a function that returns the value of `sysdate`:
code {
create or replace function get_sysdate return date
is begin
   return sysdate;
end get_sysdate;
/
code }

  I then select both, `sysdate` and the value returned by `get_sysdate` for at least three seconds:
code {
select
   sysdate,
   get_sysdate,
   level
from
   dual connect by sysdate + 3/86400 >= get_sysdate;
code }

  The result of the query shows that `sysdate` does not change while `get_sysdate` returns different values for the period being executed.

}
{ Overriding the value that SYSDATE returns

  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/fixed_date[init parameter `fixed_date`] allows to override the value that
 `sysdate` returns. Unfortunatly, this is only possible system wide, not for a particular → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session.
