$ Oracle SQL functions that are related to RAWs

Some Oracle SQL functions that are related to the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[`raw` datatype] include
  • `rawtohex`, `rawotonhex`
  • `hextoraw`

`rawtohex` and `rawtonhex` behave differently when executed in SQL and PL/SQL.
code {
SQL> select rawtohex('41') from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
3431
SQL> → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/execute[exec] → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output/api/put_line(rawtohex('41'))
41
code }

`rawtonhex(r)` is equivalent to `to_nchar(rawtohex(r)`.
