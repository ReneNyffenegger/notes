$ Oracle SQL - DML statement
@ DML statements

`call`, `delete`, `explain plan`, `insert`, `lock table`, `merge`, `select` and `update`.
-
Some consider `select` to be a *DRL* (Data Retrieval Language) statement.

{ Undoing changes of DML statements

  As long as a transaction is not → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[commited], DML statements can be undone with a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/rollback[`rollback`]. This is possible because
  the necessary information is stored in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/undo/data.

  After committing a transaction, it might be possible with → development/databases/Oracle/Features_Options_Management-Packs/Flashback.

}
{ Locks

  There are two types of locks that come into play with DML statements: *row locks* and *table locks*.
  -
  These lock types must be distinguished from *system locks* (such as → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/latch[latches], mutexes and internal locks.

  { Row locks (TX)

    Records that were changed by a DML statement are proteced from being changed by another → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction until the modification is commited by
    a *row lock* (aka *TX lock*, TX apparently standing for «transaction»).

  }

  { Table locks (TM)

   A DML statement on a table, as well as the `for update` clause and the `lock table` statement, lock the entire table with a *table lock* (aka *TM lock*).

    A table lock can be held in different modes: RS, RX, S, SRX and X

  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter] `optimizer_real_time_statistics` controls whether Oracle gathers real-time
