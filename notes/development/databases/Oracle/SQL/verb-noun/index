$ Oracle SQL: verbs and nouns

Most of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[Oracle's SQL statements] (as well as probably of other vendors' too) consist of a combination of `verb noun`.
Because → development/databases/Oracle exposes the available SQL statements in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/command[`v$sqlcommand`],
it is possible to parse the statements and extract their verbs and statements.

{ Create a view

  In order to implement the command parsing only once, I create a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[view] that I can then use multiple times.
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/command/verb_noun_view.sql||

  The view has three columns: `sql_statement`, `verb` and `noun`. Selecting from the view, it can be seen how it splits `create table`
  (value of `sql_statement`) into the verb `create` and the noun `table`.

}
{ Verb only statements

  Some statements consist only of a verb. They don't have a noun:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/command/only-verb-statements.sql||

  This returns the following verbs:
   • `comment`
   • `commit`
   • `delete`
   • `explain`
   • `insert`
   • `rename`
   • `rollback`
   • `savepoint`
   • `select`
   • `update`
   • `upsert`

}
{ Count of verbs

  Of course, it's also interesting to see how many verbs there are:

  The query returns (→ development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/18c):
