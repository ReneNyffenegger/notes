In an Oracle database, parallel SQL execution is based on
  • the Query Coordinator (QC) and
  • the Parallel Execution (PX) server processes.

{ QC - Query Coordinator

  QC initiates the parallel execution and distributes the work to PX servers.

  The QC is identified in execution plans as *PX COORDINATOR*.

}
{ PX - Parallel Execution

  PX does most of the work for the job at hand.


}
{ QC and  PX

  For example, in a parallel select statement with a `sum()`, the PX servers sum part of the data while the QC in the end will calculate the final
  sum from the results from the PX servers.
 
}
{ Enabling parallel execution

  By default, Oracle is enabled for parallel execution of queries and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statements].

  For → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statements], parallel execution needs to be enabled with
code {
alter session enable parallel dml;
code }
