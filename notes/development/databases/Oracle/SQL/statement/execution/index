$ Oracle: SQL statement execution

When a SQL statement is executed, → development/databases/Oracle checks
if it has a cached (parsed) version of it to reuse it.

These parsed representations are stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache.

If Oracle finds such a parsed statement, it is referred to as *soft parse* or *library cache hit*.
-
If not, Oracle parses the SQL statement. This is referred to as *hard parse* or *library cache miss*.

When Oracle is done executing an SQL statement, it updates some statistical numbers for that statent in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql[`v$sql`]. For long running statements, these
statistics are updated every 5 seconds.

{ Terminating (quarantining) statements

  The *Resource Manager* might terminate the execution of an SQL statement when the statement consumed too many resources.
  -
? This is referred to as quarantining the statement.

  See also the columns `AVOIDED_EXECUTIONS` and `SQL_QUARANTINE` in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/diff-sql_sqlarea[`v$sql` and `v$sqlarea`].
