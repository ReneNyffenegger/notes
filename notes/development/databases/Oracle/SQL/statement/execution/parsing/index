$ Oracle: SQL parsing

When → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[executing] an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement, the first step is to parse the SQL statement's text.
-
This is a non-trivial and costly (in terms of CPU cycles) task:
  • Syntactical check: does the statement adheres to the rules of SQL
  • If the SQL text references → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[views], they need to be parsed also and merged into the statement
  • If the SQL text references → development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms[synonyms], they need to be translated to actual objects
  • Semantic check: Are referred tables and columns available; are used data types ok etc.
  • Authorization check: Does the user have the necessary → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privileges] to execute the statement (See also error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01031_insufficient-privileges)
  • Is → development/databases/Oracle/security/RLS[Row Level Security (RLS)] involved?

{ Hard and soft parse #ora-hard-soft-parse

  Because parsing a statement is costly, Oracle checks if → development/databases/Oracle already has parsed the SQL text (and stored the result in the library cahce)
  wheneven an SQL statement is requested to be executed.

  If this is the case and the result of that previous parsing can be used
  for execution, then Oracle can use that result for the execution of the «new» SQL statement. This situation is referred to as ~soft parse~ and the reusable data structures are
  found in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache/Shared-SQL-Area of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache.

  If Oracle does not find a suitable representation in the shared SQL area, the statement needs to be parsed (possibly again). This is referred to as ~hard parse~ or *library cache miss*.

  Part of the hard parse is to determine if the available → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[optimizer statistics] are sufficient to generate an optimal
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan]. If this is not the case, Oracle determines → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/dynamic[dynamic statistics] as part
  of the hard parse.
