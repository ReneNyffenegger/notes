$ Oracle SQL Statement Execution: Diff V$SQL Statistics

The following statement gets some execution stats from a (preferably → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[running]) → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement from
`→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql` and and then gets the same performance indicators
after an interval of time (`time_diff`) again and then reports the stats and their differences.
