$ Oracle: Real Time SQL Monitoring

By default, Oracle monitors the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execution] of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] that
  • run for longer than 5 seconds, or are
  • executed in parallel

{ Limits

  The number of statement executions that will be monitored at a given time is limited to 20 times the number of cpus, but can be adjusted with the
  hidden → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter] `_sqlmon_max_plan`.

  Statements whose → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plans] exceed 300 lines are not monitored. This threshold can be
  altered with the parameter `_sqlmon_max_planlines`.

  The minimal execution time of 5 seconds that an SQL statement must be running before monitoring kicks can be adjusted with `_sqlmon_threshold`.
