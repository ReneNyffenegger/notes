$ Oracle: Parallel Statement Queuing

If `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/parallel/degree/policy` is set to `auto` or a `parallel` hint and an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement is requested to be → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[executed] in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parallel[parallel],
but the sum of requested and already executing parallel servers exceeds the value of `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/parallel/servers_target`, the statement is *queued* until sufficient servers are available.

Statements are queued with the FIFO principle.
-
It is possible, however, to run a queued statement immediately with `dbms_resource_manager.dequeue_parallel_statement`.
-
In addition, it's possible to assign priorities to consumer groups (Package `dbms_resource_manager`, procedures `create_plan_directive` and `update_plan_directive`).

Queued statements are waiting for the `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/list/resmgr/pq-queued` event.

sa:

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/parallel/degree/policy`

  The `no_statement_queuing` and `statement_queuing` hint.
