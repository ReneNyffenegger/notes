$ Oracle Parallel Execution: Distribution Methods

When *parallel execution servers* exchange data among each other, they use a *distribution method*.

Some distribution methods are:
table { ll
  Hash  ☰ The producer selects the consumer for a row by applying a hash function on one or more → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns].
  Broadcast ☰ A producer sends a row to all consumers.
  Range ☰ The producer selects the consumer for a row according to which range a value belongs.
  Round-robin ☰ Rows are randomly distributued
  QC (RANDOM) ☰ Rows are randomly sent to QC. This method is used when a statement does not have an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by[`order by` clause].
  QC (ORDER) ☰ Rows are sent to QC in order, used when statement has an `order by` clause.
  Hybrid Hash ☰ The applied method is chosen at runtime.

table }
