$ Oracle SQL Plan operation BUFFER SORT
@ BUFFER SORT

The `BUFFER SORT` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[execution plan operation] is used in different scenarios.
-
The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/merge-join/cartesian[`MERGE JOIN (CARTESIAN)`] operation always uses `BUFFER SORT` as its second
row source.

? The `BUFFER SORT` operation indicates that data is stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA rather than the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache because
the data is accessed multiple time and storing it in the buffer cache might cause contention issues with other processes that want to access the buffer cache as well.
-
The `SORT` is misleading as no SORT (necessarily) takes place. It simply points out that the same mechanism is used as is also used for other sorting mechanisms.
