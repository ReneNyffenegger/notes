$ Oracle SQL Plan operation: LOAD AS SELECT (HYBRID TSM/HWMB)
@ LOAD AS SELECT (HYBRID TSM/HWMB)

TSM stands for *Temp Segment Merge*, HWMB for *High Water Mark Brokering*.

Typically, `LOAD AS SELECT (HYBRID TSM/HWMB)` has one *child row-source*: 
→ development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering/online/optimizer-statistics-gathering[`OPTIMIZER STATISTIC GATHERING`]. In rare cases, I've also seen
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/by-index#ora-table-access-by-index-rowid-batched[`TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID BATCHED`] as second row source.
-
The parent (consuming) row-source is a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/send[`PX SEND`] with the options `QC (RANDOM)` or `RANGE` (or others?)
