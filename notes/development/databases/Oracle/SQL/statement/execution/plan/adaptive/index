$ Oracle: Adaptive SQL plans 

An *adaptive SQL plan* is a (set of?) → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plans] each of which contains an *alternative* how to access and process data for
an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement].
-
Which of these plans is used is decided at the beginning of the SQL execution.

sa:

 → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/adaptive[Adaptive query optimization]

  The column `IS_RESOLVED_ADAPTIVE_PLAN` in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/diff-sql_sqlarea[`V$SQL` or `V$SQLAREA`]

  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter] `optimizer_adaptive_plans`.

  A → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/adaptive/examples[simple example] to demonstrate an adaptive query.

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/event[oradebug event] sql_trace plan_stat=all_executions`

  Using the SQL statement → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain[`explain plan`] and
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display` to show an SQL statement's execution plan shows the *default* plan that was chosen for an
  SQL statement by the optimizer. After executing an SQL statement, `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display/cursor` can be used to show the *actually executed plan*.
  -
 `dbms_xplan.display_cursor(format=>'adaptive')` shows all → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operations], not only those that
  were executed, but also the alternative ones.
