$ Oracle: Row source statistics

Oracle can be instructed to collect *row source statistics*. When enabled, Oracle will collect data
for each row source (aka → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operations])
of an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan].
-
Numbers collected include
  • Total time spent executing a row source
  • The number or rows the row source produced/returned
  • Number of consistent and current gets
  • Number of physical reads/writes

Collection of row source statistics is enabled by
  • Setting → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[event] 10046
  • Using the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/gather/plan_statistics` hint
  • Setting the init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/statistics_level` to all

The value of the init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/rowsource/statistics_sampfreq` determines how often system time(?) is taken to measure
amount of time spent in a row source operation. Lowering the value of `_rowsource_statistics_sampfreq` increases the accuracy per rowsource, but increases time spent to measure the values and thus the
overall time («overhead») to execute an SQL statement.

{ TODO

  Do the kernel functions `qerstSnapStats` and `qerstUpdateStats` record such row source statistics?
