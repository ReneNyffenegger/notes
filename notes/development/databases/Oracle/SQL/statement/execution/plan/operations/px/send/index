$ Oracle SQL Plan operation: PX SEND

The `PX SEND` operation indicates that data is sent from on parallel execution server to another.
-
Thus, the parent operator is either
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/receive[`PX RECEIVE`] or
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/coordinator[`PX COORDINATOR`]

`PX SEND` has exactly one child row source.


Options I have seen together with th `PX BLOCK` operation are
   • `1 SLAVE`
   • `BROADCAST`
   • `HASH`
   • `HASH (BLOCK ADDRESS)`
   • `HASH (RANDOM)`
   • `HYBRID (ROWID PKEY)`
   • `HYBRID HASH`
   • `HYBRID HASH (SKEW)`
   • `QC (ORDER)`
   • `QC (RANDOM)`
   • `RANDOM LOCAL`
   • `RANGE`
   • `ROUND-ROBIN`

{ TODO

  The `PX SEND` operation corresponds to a DFO (Data Flow Operation).
