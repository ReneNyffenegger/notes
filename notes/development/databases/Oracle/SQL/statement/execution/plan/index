$ Oracle: SQL execution plan

An *execution plan* consists of the required steps and their dependency among each other that is needed to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execute] an
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement].


{ Optimizer

  The → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer[optimizer's] main goal is to generate the optimal execution plan for SQL statements.

? The optimizer manages execution plans with *SQL plan management*.

}
{ Optimizer statistics

  When the optimzer formulates a plan, it bases its decision on statistical numbers, commonly referred to as *optimizer statistics*.

  Such statistical numbers include:
    • Table related statistics such as numbers of rows
    • Column statistics such as number of nulls
    • Index related statistics such as B-tree levels
    • System statistics such as CPU and I/O performance 


}
{ Hints

  Hints allow a developer to override the execution plan that would be chosen by Oracle without hint.

}

{ Adaptive query optimazation

  With *adaptive query optimazation*, it is possible to adjust an execution plan at runtiime.

  Adaptive query optimazation complements using statistics when generating an optimal plan for an SQL statement.
