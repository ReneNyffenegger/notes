$ Oracle: SQL execution plan
@ SQL execution plan

An *execution plan* consists of the required steps and their dependency among each other that is needed to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execute] an
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement].

The execution plan is stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache/Shared-SQL-Area.

{ Optimizer

  The → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer[optimizer's] main goal is to generate the optimal execution plan for SQL statements.

?  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/management monitors execution plans over time in order to check if they deteriorate.

}
{ Optimizer statistics

  When the optimizer formulates a plan, it bases its decision on statistical numbers, commonly referred to as → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[optimizer statistics].

  Such statistical numbers include:
    • Table related statistics such as numbers of rows
    • Column statistics such as number of nulls
    • Index related statistics such as B-tree levels
    • System statistics such as CPU and I/O performance 


}
{ Hints

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[Hints] allow a developer to override the execution plan that Oracle would have chosen otherwise.

}


sa:

  A plan consists of a hierarchical list of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[operations].

  With → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/adaptive[adaptive query optimization], the *statement executor* can adjust an SQL execution plan (which was created at *compile-time*) at *run-time*.

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/directive[SQL plan directives] store statistical information about past executions of an SQL statement. They're used to (hopefully)
  create a more optimal plan for a future execution of the SQL statement.
