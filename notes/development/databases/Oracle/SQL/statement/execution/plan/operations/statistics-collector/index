$ Oracle SQL Plan operation STATISTICS COLLECTOR
@ STATISTICS COLLECTOR

The `STATISTICS COLLECTOR` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operation] is used in conjunction with
→ development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/adaptive[adaptive query optimization] when the → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer
creates an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/adaptive[adaptive plan].

This row source collects *run-time statistics* such as cardinality and data distribution (histograms).

I've encountered `STATISTICS COLLECTOR` as first row source of the following parent operations:
   • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/nested-loops` (ANTI, OUTER, SEMI and ordinary).
   • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/send` (HYBRID HASH)


sa:
   Compare with `→ development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering/online/optimizer-statistics-gathering`

   Other → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operators]
