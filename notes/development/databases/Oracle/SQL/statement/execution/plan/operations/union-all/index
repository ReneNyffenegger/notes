$ Oracle SQL Plan operation UNION-ALL
@ UNION-ALL


The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operator] `UNION-ALL` is used for both, queries using the
set operators → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[`union all`] and
`→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union`.


Create a few demonstration tables:
code {
create table tq84_A (nm number, tx varchar2(10));
create table tq84_B (nm number, tx varchar2(10));
create table tq84_C (nm number, tx varchar2(10));
code }

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain for
   select nm, tx from tq84_A → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[union all]
   select nm, tx from tq84_B → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[union all]
   select nm, tx from tq84_c
;

select * from table(→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display[dbms_xplan.display](format=>'basic'));
--
-- -------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation          | Name   |
-- -------------------------------------
-- |   0 | → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/statement/select   |        |
-- |   1 |  UNION-ALL         |        |
-- |   2 |   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_A |
-- |   3 |   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_B |
-- |   4 |   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_C |
-- -------------------------------------
code }


Almost the same thing, but using `union`. Note the additional `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/sort/unique`
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain for
   select nm, tx from tq84_A → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union
   select nm, tx from tq84_B → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union
   select nm, tx from tq84_c
;

select * from table(→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display[dbms_xplan.display](format=>'basic'));
--
-- --------------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation           | Name   |
-- --------------------------------------
-- |   0 | → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/statement/select    |        |
-- |   1 |  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/sort/unique        |        |
-- |   2 |   UNION-ALL         |        |
-- |   3 |    → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_A |
-- |   4 |    → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_B |
-- |   5 |    → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| TQ84_C |
-- --------------------------------------
code }

Claning up:
code {
drop table tq84_C;
drop table tq84_B;
drop table tq84_A;
code }

sa:
  The SQL set operator → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[`union all`].

  The `UNION-ALL` plan operator might be used for the → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/query-transformations/or-expansion[OR expansion] query transformation.

  Other → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operators].
  -
  The `CONCATENATION` plan operator is functionally equivalent to `UNION-ALL`.
