$ Oracle SQL Plan operation MERGE JOIN (CARTESIAN)
@ MERGE JOIN CARTESIAN

The `MERGE JOIN (CARTESIAN)` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[execution plan operation] always has two child row sources.
-
The second child row source is a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/buffer/sort[`BUFFER SORT`] operation.
