$ Oracle: SQL plan directive

Plan directives are created automatically by the database and contain statistical data about a re-optimizable SQL statement. This data is used in a future execution of the
SQL statement to (hopefully) produce a more optimal → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan].

An SQL plan directive cannot be created manually.

Oracle maintains plan directives in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX[`SYSAUX` tablespace].
-
SQL directives that have not been used for 53 weeks are purged from the repository.

It should be noted that plan directives are not specifically created for SQL statements, but rather for *query expressions* used in SQL statements.

Such plan directives are used (for example?) to determine if → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/extended (such as *column groups*) are missing. (Compare with the
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[`dbms_stats`] preference `auto_stat_extension`).
