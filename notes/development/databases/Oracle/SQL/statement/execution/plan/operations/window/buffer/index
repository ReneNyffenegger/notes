$ Oracle SQL Plan operation: WINDOW (BUFFER)

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[SQL plan operation] `WINDOW (BUFFER)` is used in SQL statements with
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/analytic[analytic functions] whose `OVER()` clause does not have a `partition by clause` or an `order by` clause.
-
If the `OVER()` clause had either or both clauses, Oracle would use the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/window/sort[`WINDOW (SORT)` plan operation].

code {
create table tq84_A (
   pt   varchar2(1),
   nm   number
);

explain plan for
select
   pt,
   nm,
   MAX(NM) OVER() -- NOTE: NO PARTITION BY CLAUSE
from
   tq84_A;

select * from table(dbms_xplan.display(format => 'basic'));

  I just found out that in the following case where an analytic function is combined with a group by and/or(?) aggregate function, the `WINDOW BUFFER` operations is also used:

code {
create table tq84_tab (
   val   number,
   grp_1 char(1),
   grp_2 char(1)
);

insert into tq84_tab
select
   mod(level * 37, 11),
   chr(ascii('A') + mod(level  , 13)),
   chr(ascii('A') + mod(level*7, 17))
from
   dual connect by level <= 10000;

explain plan for
select
   sum(sum(val)) over (partition by grp_1 order by grp_2) val,
   grp_1,
   grp_2
from
   tq84_tab
group by
   grp_1,
   grp_2
;

select * from table(dbms_xplan.display(format=>'basic'));

-- ----------------------------------------

drop table tq84_tab;
code }

}
