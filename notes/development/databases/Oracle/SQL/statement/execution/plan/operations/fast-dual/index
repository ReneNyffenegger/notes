$ Oracle SQL Plan operation FAST DUAL

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[row source] `FAST DUAL` when selecting an expression which does not involve `DUMMY` from `dual`.

The plan for `select * from dual` (which involves `DUMMY` through `*`) selects from `DUAL` with *full table access*:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain for
   select * from dual;
   
select * from table(→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display[dbms_xplan.display](format=>'basic'));
--
-- ----------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation         | Name |
-- ----------------------------------
-- |   0 | → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/statement/select  |      |
-- |   1 |  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/full[TABLE ACCESS FULL]| DUAL |
-- ----------------------------------
code }

However, when selecting an «ordinary» expression from `dual`, the `FAST DUAL` row source is used:
code {
explain plan for
   select sysdate from dual;
   
select * from table(dbms_xplan.display(format=>'basic'));
--
-- ---------------------------------
-- | Id  | Operation        | Name |
-- ---------------------------------
-- |   0 | → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/statement/select |      |
-- |   1 |  FAST DUAL       |      |
-- ---------------------------------
code }
