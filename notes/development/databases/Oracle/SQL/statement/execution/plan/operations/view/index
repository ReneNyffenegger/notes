$ Oracle SQL Plan operation: VIEW

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[exection plan operation] `VIEW` always has exactly one child operation and never has an «option».

Jonathan Lewis → https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/oracle-databases/execution-plans-part-7-query-blocks-and-inline-views/[says about the `VIEW` operation] that they
"
  identify a separately optimized query block in [a] (possibly transformed)
  SQL – sometimes this will also mean that the result set of that piece of SQL
  will be completely built in memory before the next steps of the query plan
  take place but this is not necessarily the case.
