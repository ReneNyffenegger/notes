Jonathan Lewis → https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/oracle-databases/execution-plans-part-7-query-blocks-and-inline-views/[says about the `VIEW` operation] that they
"
  identify a separately optimized query block in [a] (possibly transformed)

  will be completely built in memory before the next steps of the query plan
  take place but this is not necessarily the case.
