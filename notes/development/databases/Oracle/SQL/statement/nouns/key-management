$ Oracle SQL noun: KEY MANAGEMENT

{ Creating a keystore


  In a shell on the database server
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/mkdir /opt/oracle/wallet
code }

  Then in an SQL prompt:
code {
administer key management create keystore '/opt/oracle/wallet' identified by theWalletsSecret;
code }

  This command created the file `ewallet.p12` in the wallet directory:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/ls → Linux/shell/commands/ls/l[-l] /opt/oracle/wallet
total 4
-rw------- 1 oracle oinstall 2555 Feb 17 09:17 ewallet.p12
code }

}

{ TODO

code {
administer key management set keystore open identified by …;
code }

code {
administer key management set key identified by … with backup;
code }

  The following command creates `/opt/oracle/wallet/cwallet.sso`:
code {
administer key management create       auto_login keystore from keystore '/opt/oracle/wallet' identified by theWalletsSecret;
code }

code {
administer key management create local auto_login keystore from keystore '/opt/oracle/wallet' identified by theWalletsSecret;
code }

  Change the keystore's password:
code {
administer key management alter keystore password identified by theWalletsSecret set theWalletsNewSecret with backup using 'pwd_change';
code }

  Back up the keystore:
code {
administer key management backup keystore using 'wallet-backup-of-2024-02-17' identified by theWalletsSecret;
code }

  As per MOS Note 2253348.1, a security officer should be given the SYSKM privilege rather than the SYSDBA - so that the security officer cannot execute `alter system` commands such as `alter system set encryption key …`.
