$ Oracle SQL noun: VIEW

{ CREATE VIEW

code {
drop   table tq84_tab;
create table tq84_tab (
    num    number,
    txt    varchar2(10)
);
code }

  A star `*` is expanded to the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns names when a view is created:
code {
drop   view  tq84_vw;
create view  tq84_vw as select * from tq84_tab;
code }

code {
select text from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/views[user_views] where view_name = 'TQ84_VW';
-- select "NUM","TXT" from tq84_tab
code }

code {
alter table tq84_tab add dt date;
select dt from tq84_vw;
-- → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00904_invalid-identifier/index[ORA-00904: "DT": invalid identifier]
code }

  { Specifying the view's column names

    The `create view` statement allows to explicitly specify the column names of the view:
code {
create view tq84_vw_col_names
   (n, t)
as
select
   num,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab;
code }

   Although the `select` statement in the view selects the columns `num` and `txt`, the view now has the column names `n` and `t`:
code {
select n, t from tq84_vw_col_names;
code }

   However, the column names are not reflected in `text` of `user_views`:
code {
SQL> select text from user_views where view_name = 'TQ84_VW_COL_NAMES';

select
   num,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab
code }
  

  }
  { Forcing the creation of a view

    Oracle can be forced to create a view even if the view's select statement is invalid:
code {
create FORCE view xyz_v as select * from inexisting_table;
--
-- View XYZ_V created.
code }

    Of course, the view's status in invalid:
code {
select status from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects/[user_objects] where object_name = 'XYZ_V';
--
-- INVALID
code }

   More information can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/errors[`user_errors`]:
code {
select text from user_errors where name = 'XYZ_V';
--
-- ORA-54039: table must have at least one column that is not invisible
-- ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
code }

  }
  { SHARING=…

code {
create view vvv sharing=none as select * from dual;
create view mmm sharing=metadata as select * from dual;
create view ddd sharing=extended data as select * from dual;
code }

     `sharing=extended data` sets the extended data bit (65536) and metadata link bits in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/obj`
     and the `common_data` bit in `view$`.

  }
  { CONTAINER_DATA

    An undocumented(?) option of `create view` is `container_data`:
code {
create or replace view abc_v
   CONTAINER_DATA
   sharing=object
   (
      col_1,
      col_2
   )
   as select …
code }

  }

}
