$ Oracle SQL noun: TRANSACTION

{ SET TRANSACTION

 `set transaction` starts a new transaction and defines some characteristics of this transaction:
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction#ora-trx-read-only[Read-only] or writable. (Setting the transaction to read only by user `SYS` is ignored)
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/isolation-levels[Isolation level]: `serializable` or `read committed`. `read committed` is the default.
    • The used rollback segment (ignored if Oracle runs in automatic undo mode)
    • The name of the transaction. Naming transactions is especially useful in distributed database environments to *resolve in-doubt transactions*.

  The `set transaction` statement is optional, however, if it is used, it must be the first statement in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction.
