$ Effects of ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA in AUTHID DEFINER and AUTHID CURRENT_USER packages

If → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate[`execute immediate`] is used to execute a
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/session-system-control/alter-session/current_schema[`alter session set current_schema`] statement in stored procedure with
`→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/authid definer`, it does not affect the environment in which the `execute immediate` statement was executed.
-
However, in an `authid current_user` procedure (or package), it is.

This is demonstrated in the following research.

{ Creating two users/schemas

  We need two schemas, one for the packages and one that executes the stored procuders.

  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/statement/nouns/session/alter/set/current_schema/execute-immediate/create-users.sql||

}
{ Packages

  The two packages. One is defined with `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/authid definer` the other with `authid current_user`. Both have exactly one procedure: `do_something.`

  In both cases, `do_something` uses `execute immediate` to
    • print the «actual» current schema,
    • change the current schema and
    • print the «actual» current schema again

  After executing `execute immediate`, the procedure prints the «actual» current schema yet again.

  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/statement/nouns/session/alter/set/current_schema/execute-immediate/pkg-owner.sql||

}
{ Executing the stored procedures

  Execute `do_something` in both packages:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/statement/nouns/session/alter/set/current_schema/execute-immediate/pkg-user.sql||

  It prints
code {
kg_definer
  exec immediate: current schema before setting current_schema: PKG_OWNER
  exec immediate: current schema after  setting current_schema: PKG_USER
  current schema after execute immediate:                       PKG_OWNER
pkg_current_user
  exec immediate: current schema before setting current_schema: PKG_USER
  exec immediate: current schema after  setting current_schema: PKG_OWNER
  current schema after execute immediate:                       PKG_OWNER
code }

}
