$ Oracle: ALTER SYSTEM DUMP DATAFILE

code {
ALTER SYSTEM DUMP DATAFILE datafileNumber BLOCK blockNumber;
ALTER SYSTEM DUMP DATAFILE datafileNumber BLOCK MIN blockNumberStart BLOCK MAX blockNumberEnd;
code }

`alter system dump datafile` allows to dump one
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[block] or a contiguous range of blocks from a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data.

By default, this command produces a *symbolic dump*, i.e. the values in the block are interpreted which makes it easier to read the content of a dump.
-
It's possible to force a hexadecimal dump of the block by first setting the event 10289. Then no interpretation takes place (which might be needed to analyze
a corrupt block).

{ Dumping a block #ora-dump-block

  The following procedures takes a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/rowid and dumps the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data block] where this rowid points at to a
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file.

  If the second parameter (`p_symbolic`) is set to false, the block is dumped hexadecimally.

{ Dumping a segment header block

code {
create table tq84_seg_hdr_dump_test (
   col_1   number,
   col_2   varchar2(20)

  A segment header is just a special type of block and can therefore be dumped with `alter system dump …` as well.

  The block number of the segment header can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/segments[`dba_segments`]:
code {
select
   header_file,
   header_block
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/segments[dba_segments]
where
   segment_name = 'TQ84_SEG_HDR_DUMP_TEST';
--
-- HEADER_FILE HEADER_BLOCK
-- ----------- ------------
--           4         2250
code }

code {
alter system dump datafile 4 block 2250;
code }

  After dumping the block, the tracefile is found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/diag/info[`v$diag_info`] with the
  following query:
code {
select
   value trace_file
from
   v$diag_info
where
   name = 'Default Trace File';
code }

}
