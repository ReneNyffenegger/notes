$ Oracle: CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT …

`create table … as select …` (aka CTAS) creates a table whose column-data types and values stored in its records are determined by the
result set of a → development/databases/SQL/select[`select` statement].

code {
create table tbl_copy
-- nologging
-- pctfree
as
select
   col_1,
   col_4,
   col_5
from
   tbl;
code }

{ WITH clause #ora-ctas-with

  A `create table as select` statement can be combined with a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[`WITH` clause] as shown below:
code {
create table tq84_numbers
as
with nums as (
   select
      level as num,
      to_char(to_date(level, 'j'), 'jsp')  spelled
   from
      dual connect by level <= 10000
)
select
   num,
   spelled
from
   nums;
code }

}

{ Parallel #ora-ctas-parallel

  It must be made sure that the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[session] is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parallel#ora-enable-paralle-execution[enabled]
  for parallel DDLs:
code {
alter session enable parallel ddl;
code }

  Then, the table can be created «parallely»:
code {
create table tab_xyz PARALLEL as
select
  …
code }

}

{ Specifying column names

  It is possible to specify column names with ther → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types inferred from the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statement]:
code {
create table tq84_xyz (foo, bar, baz)
as
   select
      object_name,
      object_type,
      created
   from
      user_objects;
      
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/describe[desc] tq84_xyz;
code }

  Specifying the data types as well might result in an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01773_may-not-specify-column-datatype-in-this-CREATE-TABLE error.

}

sa:

  A `create table as select` will perform an → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/gathering/online[online statistics gathering].

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statement]

  A `create table … as …` that involves a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/link and
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[CLOBs or BLOBs] and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/analytic[analytic functions] sometimes(?) throws a
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-22992_cannot-use-LOB-locators-selected-from-remote-tables#ora-22992-ctas[ORA-22992: cannot use LOB locators selected from remote tables].

  The `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/load/as-select` execution plan operator.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[event] 14529 turns on or off *create partition exchange tables with CTAS*.
