$ Oracle: CREATE TABLE … AS SELECT …

`create table … as select …` (aka CTAS) creates a table whose column-data types and values stored in its records are determined by the
result set of a → development/databases/SQL/select[`select` statement].

code {
create table tbl_copy
-- nologging
-- pctfree
as
select
   col_1,
   col_4,
   col_5
from
   tbl;
code }

{ Parallel #ora-ctas-parallel

  It must be made sure that the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[session] is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parallel#ora-enable-paralle-execution[enabled]
  for parallel DDLs:
code {
alter session enable parallel ddl;
code }

  Then, the table can be created «parallely»:
code {
create table tab_xyz PARALLEL as
select
  …
code }

}
