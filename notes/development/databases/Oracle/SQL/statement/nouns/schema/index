$ Oracle SQL noun: SCHEMA

{ CREATE SCHEMA #ora-create-schema

  The `create schema` statement can be used to create multiple → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[views] and/or → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant multiple → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privileges]
  in a single → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction (by default, a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statement] such as `create table` or `create view`
  commits the current transaction).

  It should be noted that `create schema` *adds* objects to an existing schema, the schema itself is created with the `create user` statement.
