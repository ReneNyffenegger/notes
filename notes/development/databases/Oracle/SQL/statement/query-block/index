$ Oracle SQL statement: query block
@ query block

A query block is one of
  • a top level → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statement],
  • a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery, or
  • an unmerged view.

? An → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement consists of one or more query blocks in a tree-structure (a query block has zero, one or more sub-query blocks).
-
The → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer optimizes these query blocks from the bottom (the nodes of the tree) towards the tree-root.


? After a statement has been parsed, the parsed query (which represents the statement's query blocks) is passed to the *query transformer* which tries to transform these query blocks into a more optimal
execution plan, using methods such as
 • View Merging
 • Predicate Pushing
 • → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/features/subquery/unnesting[Subquery unnesting]
 • Query Rewrite with Materialized Views


{ Query block hints

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[Hints] that specifically address query blocks include
    • `qb_name` (to override a generated query block name)
    • `star_transformation`
    • `unnest`
    • … ?

  In order to refer to a query block in a hint, the respective query block name needs to be prefixed with an at symbol (for exampl `@QB_FOO`).

{ Showing query block names in an execution plan

  The following example tries to demonstrate how query block names show up in an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain[explained] SQL statement.

  Create two table to be used for the query:
code {
create table tq84_outer (
   id number,
   txt varchar2(20),
   foo varchar2(20)
);

create table tq84_inner (
   id number,
   txt varchar2(20)
);
code }

   Use the `qb_name` hints to specifically name a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery:
code {
explain plan for
select /*+ qb_name(outer_query) */
   id,
   txt
from
   tq84_outer one where
   one.id = (select /*+ qb_name(subquery) */
                max(two.id)
             from
                tq84_inner two
             where
                two.txt = one.txt
            );
code }

  Show the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan]:
code {
select
   lpad('| ', (pln.depth-1) * 2, '| ') || pln.operation || case when pln.options is not null then ' (' || pln.options || ')' end op,
   pln.object_owner || nvl2(pln.object_owner, '.', '') || pln.object_name object_owner_name,
   pln.object_alias,
   pln.→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table/columns/qblock_name
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[plan_table] pln where plan_id = (select max(plan_id) from plan_table)
order by
   pln.id
;
code }

  The plan is:
code {
OP                        OBJECT_OWNER_NAME  OBJECT_ALIAS         QBLOCK_NAME
-----------------------   -----------------  ------------------   -----------
SELECT STATEMENT
FILTER                                                            OUTER_QUERY
| TABLE ACCESS (FULL)     RENE.TQ84_OUTER    "ONE"@"OUTER_QUERY"  OUTER_QUERY
| SORT (AGGREGATE)                                                SUBQUERY
| | TABLE ACCESS (FULL)   RENE.TQ84_INNER    "TWO"@"SUBQUERY"     SUBQUERY
code }

  TODO: Try the same thing with an index:
code {
create index tq84_outer_ix on tq84_outer(id);
code }
