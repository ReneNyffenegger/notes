$ Oracle: PLAN_TABLE

`PLAN_TABLE` is the name of a table that is used by the SQL statement → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain[`explain plan`] to write its result to.

Such a plan table can be created by executing → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catplan_sql[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catplan.sql`].
Among others, this script creates a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/global-temporary[global temporary table] named `PLAN_TABLE$` (which belongs to
→ development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users/oracle-maintained/sys[`SYS`]) and a publicy synonym, `PLAN_TABLE`, that points to the table.

A plan table can also be created by just executing the following create table statement:
code {
create table PLAN_TABLE /* sharing=none */  (
        statement_id       varchar2(30)  ,  -- The value that was given to the (optional) clause SET STATEMENT_ID in an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain[explain plan] statement

{ object_alias

  The value of `object_alias` is either → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`] or matches the
  → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] `"[^"]+"@"[^"]+"$`, the following SQL does not return a record (at least I never encountered one):
code {
select count(*) from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan[v$sql_plan] where not regexp_like(object_alias, '"[^"]+"@"[^"]+"$');
code }

?  The second part (after the `@`, which is enclosed in `"…"`) seems to correspond to a qblock name.

code {
select
   object_alias,
--
-- If not using an alias in the SQL statement, the first part of the object alias
-- is equal to the object_name. Note, that object_name can also refer to an index
-- in which case othe first part of the object alias is null:
   regexp_replace(object_alias, '^"([^"]+)"@"[^"]+"$', '\1') object_alias_part_1,
   object_name,
 
--
-- Often, the second part of the object alias is equal to the qblock_name (
-- especially if qblock_name is not using the hash-semantics (SEL$12EC7C91):
   regexp_replace(object_alias, '^"[^"]+"@"([^"]+)"$', '\1') object_alias_part_2,
   qblock_name,
-- -----
   object_type,
   operation
-- v$sql_plan.*
from
   v$sql_plan;
code }

}
{ access_predicates

code {
select
   count(*),
   operation
-- options
from
   v$sql_plan
where
   access_predicates is not null
group by
    operation
--  options
order by
   count(*) desc;
--
-- INDEX
