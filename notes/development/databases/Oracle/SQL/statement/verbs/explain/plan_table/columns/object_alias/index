$ Oracle PLAN_TABLE: column OBJECT_ALIAS
@ object_alias

The value of `object_alias` is either → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`] or matches the
→ development/regular-expressions[regular expression] `"[^"]+"@"[^"]+"$`, the following → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement does not return a record (at least I never encountered one):
code {
select count(*) from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan[v$sql_plan] where not regexp_like(object_alias, '"[^"]+"@"[^"]+"$');
code }

?  The second part (after the `@`, which is enclosed in `"…"`) seems to correspond to a qblock name.

code {
select
   object_alias,
--
-- If not using an alias in the SQL statement, the first part of the object alias
-- is equal to the object_name. Note, that object_name can also refer to an index
-- in which case othe first part of the object alias is null:
   regexp_replace(object_alias, '^"([^"]+)"@"[^"]+"$', '\1') object_alias_part_1,
   object_name,
 
--
-- Often, the second part of the object alias is equal to the qblock_name (
-- especially if qblock_name is not using the hash-semantics (SEL$12EC7C91):
   regexp_replace(object_alias, '^"[^"]+"@"([^"]+)"$', '\1') object_alias_part_2,
   qblock_name,
-- -----
   object_type,
   operation
-- v$sql_plan.*
from
   v$sql_plan;
code }


sa:
  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[`plan_table`] and its column
  `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table/columns/qblock_name`.
