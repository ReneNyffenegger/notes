$ Oracle: Statement ID of an execution plan

Oracle allows to specify a *statement id* when a plan is explained with the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain` statement.
-
The purpose of this id is to identify a given → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan] in the table `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table`: the value is found in the column `statement_id`:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain
   set statement_id = 'st1'
for
   select
      foo, bar, baz
   from
      tab;

…
select … from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table where statement_id = 'st1';
code }

The statement id can also be passed as an argument to `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display`.
code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(statement_id => 'st1'));
code }
