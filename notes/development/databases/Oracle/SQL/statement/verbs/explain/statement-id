$ Oracle: Statement ID of an execution plan

Oracle allows to specify a *statement id* when a plan is explained. The value of this statement is found in the column `statement_id` of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[`plan_table`] and allows to select the records that belong to a plan more easily:
code {
explain plan
   set statement_id = 'st1'
for
   select
      foo, bar, baz
   from
      tab;

…
select … from plan_table where statement_id = 'st1';
…
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(statement_id => 'st1'));
code }
