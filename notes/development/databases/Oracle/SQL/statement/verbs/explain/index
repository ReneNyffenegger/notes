$ Oracle SQL: EXPLAIN PLAN
@ explain plan

Whenever Oracle → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[executes] an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement, it has to build (compile)
an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[plan] that specifies how and in what order (→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join[join] methods)
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] and → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] are accessed.

Oracle's SQL statement `EXPLAIN PLAN` can be given an SQL statement in order for a user to query such an execution plan:
code {
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR <sql statement>;
code }

By default, `explain plan` writes the result into a table named → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[`plan_table`].
However, the destination table can changed with the `into …` clause, see → #ora-explain-plan-result-table[below]. It is also possible to give a plan
a *statement id* so that records that belong to a plan can be identified (see → #ora-explain-plan-stmt-id[here]).
-
It turns out that the installation script → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catplan_sql[`catplan.sql`] creates a public synonym `plan_table` that points to a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/global-temporary[global temporary table (GTT)] named `plan_table$`. Because `plan_table$` is a GTT, every session has its own version of the contents of `plan_table$`.

`explain plan` is a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statement], so the modifications made by this statement are not → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[commited].

{ Show execution plan with DBMS_XPLAN

The result that is written into the plan table can be displayed with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan#dbms_xplan-display[`dbms_xplan.display`]):
code {
SQL> explain plan for select * from dual connect by level < 10;
SQL> select * from table(dbms_xplan.display);
…
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Id  | Operation                    | Name | Rows  | Bytes | Cost (%CPU)| Time     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   0 | SELECT STATEMENT             |      |     1 |     2 |     2   (0)| 00:00:01 |
|*  1 |  CONNECT BY WITHOUT FILTERING|      |       |       |            |          |
|   2 |   TABLE ACCESS FULL          | DUAL |     1 |     2 |     2   (0)| 00:00:01 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code }

}
{ Show execution plan with a SELECT statement

  It is also possible to query a plan directly from the `plan_table`. This boils down to a variant of
code {
select
   lpad(' ', depth*2) || operation || ' ' || options op,
   object_name
from
   plan_table
where
   plan_id = (select max(plan_id) from plan_table)
order by
   id
;
code }

  Of course, in the real world, more columns that are found in `plan_table` would probably be added.

}
{ Specifying a statement id #ora-explain-plan-stmt-id

  Oracle allows to specify a *statement id* when a plan is explained. The value of this statement is found in the column `statement_id` of the
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[`plan_table`] and allows to select the records that belong to a plan more easily:
code {
explain plan
   set statement_id = 'st1'
for
   select
      foo, bar, baz
   from
      tab;
code }

  If the `set statement_id` clause is not used, `statement_id` is assigned from → development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences `SYS.ORA_PLAN_ID_SEQ$`.

}
{ Specifying a result table #ora-explain-plan-result-table
 
  It is also possible to specify a result table that is different from `plan_table`:
code {
explain plan
-- set statement_id = 'st1'
into
   tq84_plan
for
   select
      foo, bar, baz
   from
      tab;
code }

}
{ Caveats

 `EXPLAIN PLAN` assumes bind variables to be → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2[a `varchar2` data type] and accordingly calulates an execution plan.

  If then the same statement is executed but with the bind variables bound to different data types, Oracle might choose to execute the statement with a different
  plan.

sa:

  The Package → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan[`dbms_xplan`] provides the table function
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display[`display`] which formats the content of the plan table after executing an `explain plan` statement.
