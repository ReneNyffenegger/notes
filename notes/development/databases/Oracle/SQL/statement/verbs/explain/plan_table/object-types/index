$ Oracle: Object types related to the PLAN_TABLE

{ GENERIC_PLAN_OBJECT

 `GENERIC_PLAN_OBJECT` is the base type from which a few specialized objects derive:
code {
select
   type_name
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/types[dba_types]
where
   supertype_name = 'GENERIC_PLAN_OBJECT'
order by
   type_name;
--
-- ADVISOR_OBJECT
-- AWR_OBJECT
-- CURSOR_CACHE_OBJECT
-- PLAN_TABLE_OBJECT
-- SPM_OBJECT
-- SQLSET_OBJECT
-- SQL_PROFILE_OBJECT
code }
  
   
  An instance of `generic_plan_object` is used in the procedure `compare_plans` of → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan[`dbms_xplan`]:
code {
select
   package_name,
   object_name     as func_or_proc_name   ,
   argument_name
from
   dba_arguments
where
   type_name = 'GENERIC_PLAN_OBJECT';
code }

  There is also a `table of generic_plan_object`:
code {
select type_name from dba_coll_types where elem_type_name = 'GENERIC_PLAN_OBJECT'
--
-- PLAN_OBJECT_LIST
code }
  

}
