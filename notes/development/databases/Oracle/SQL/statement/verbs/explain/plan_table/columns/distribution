$ Oracle PLAN_TABLE: column DISTRIBUTION
@ distribution

The value of the column `distribution` in a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[plan table] lists an
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[operation's]
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parallel/distribution-methods[distribution method] in an execution plan of a
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parallel[parallel statement].

This value is only relevant for the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operation]
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/send[`PX SEND`]. Thus, the following query returns `0`:
code {
select
   count(*)
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan
where
   distribution is not null and
   operation <> 'PX SEND'
;
code }

In records where `distribution` is not `null` (i. e. in `PX SEND` records), the value of distribution is equal to that of `options`: the following
query return `0`:
code {
select
   count(*)
from
   v$sql_plan
where
   distribution is not null and
   nvl(options, 'x') <> distribution
;
code }

code {
select
-- count(*),
   distribution
from
   v$sql_plan
where
   distribution  is not null
group by
   distribution
order by
   distribution
;
