$ Oracle PLAN_TABLE: columns OBJECT_NAME and OBJECT_OWNER

The columns `object_name` and `object_owner` in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table[`plan_table`] identify the
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] that is being accessed in the respective → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[plan operation].

`object_name` and `object_owner` might be used to join the record to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/statistics[`all_tab_statistics`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ind/statistics[`all_ind_statistics`] to find objects that are accessed in an SQL statement whose
→ development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[statistics] are not taken for a certain amount of time. This is
demonstrated in
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table/columns/object_name-owner/last-analyzed[use `explain plan` to find objects whose statistics weren't taken for a certain amount of time].
