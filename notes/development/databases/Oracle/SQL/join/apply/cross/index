$ Oracle SQL: CROSS APPLY

A *cross apply → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join* is a variation of the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/cross[ANSI cross join].

As per → https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:9530807800346558418[an answer on asktom], Oracle supports `cross apply` in order to improve
compatibility with other database products, notably to
  • ensure LINQ query compatibility
  • help customers migrate SQL statements from → development/databases/SQL-Server to Oracle

{ Example

  Create tables …
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/join/apply/cross/ex-1/tables.sql||

  … fill them with some data …
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/join/apply/cross/ex-1/data.sql||

  … and then use `cross apply` to select from them.
  -
  Note that the *join condition* is formulated *within* the subquery, not after it:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/join/apply/cross/ex-1/select.sql||

  Show the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/join/apply/cross/ex-1/explain-plan.sql||

  Show the execution plan of an SQL statement that uses `left join` rather than `cross apply`. Such an SQL statement produces the same result, but uses a different execution plan:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/join/apply/cross/ex-1/explain-plan-join.sql||

}

sa:

? An `outer apply` is to `cross apply` what an `left outer join` is to a `join`.
