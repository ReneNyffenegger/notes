$ Oracle: Join method «nested loop»
@ nested loop

When two tables are joined with a *nested loop*, Oracle reads all records in the *outer table* that match the *single-table predicate* on that table.
-
For each row that is found in the outer table, the corresponding record(s) in the *inner table* are search, either by full table scan or by index lookup.

Typical scenarios that lead to a nested loop join include
  • Join of «small» data sets
  • Join of «large» data sets with optimizer mode set to `first_row`
  • The join condition allows to access the inner table efficiently
