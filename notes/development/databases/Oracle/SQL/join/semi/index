$ Oracle: Semi join

A *semi join* is a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join that stops when the first hit is encountered. Thus, at most one record from the join's left table is returned.

Typically, a semi join is used in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] that contain conditions like `where exists (select … from …)` or
`where id in (select s.id from xyz as s)`.

sa:

  Unlike a semi join, an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/anti[anti joins] returns *one* record from the left table if no matching record is found in the right table.

  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[Event] 10161 swtiches on or off recursive semi-joins.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter] `always_semi_join`.
