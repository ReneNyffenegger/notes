@ DDL statements

DDL Statements:
`→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/analyze`, `associate statistics`, `audit`, `comment`, `create ...`, `disassociate statistics`, `drop ... `, `flashback ... `, `grant`, `noaudit`, `purge`, `rename`, `revoke`, `truncate`

Statements beginning with `alter` except → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session[`alter system`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter[`alter system`] statements (which are session control and system control statements respectively)
are also DDL statements.

The database changes that are caused by a DDL statement are reflected in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary.

DDL statements without DML compenents (such as `create table as select …`) do not undergo SQL statement optimaztion.
