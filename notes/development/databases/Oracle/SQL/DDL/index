$ Oracle SQL - DDL statements
@ DDL statements

DDL Statements:
`→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/analyze`, `associate statistics`, `audit`, `comment`, `create ...`, `disassociate statistics`, `drop ... `, `flashback ... `, `grant`, `noaudit`, `purge`, `rename`, `revoke`, `truncate`

Statements beginning with `alter` except → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session[`alter system`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter[`alter system`] statements (which are session control and system control statements respectively)
are also DDL statements.

The database changes that are caused by a DDL statement are reflected in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary.

DDL statements without DML compenents (such as `create table as select …`) do not undergo SQL statement optimization.

sa:

  The DDL to (re-)create an → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] can be obtained with
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata/api/get/ddl[`dbms_metadata.get_ddl`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database

  The column `pddl_status` in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] shows if *parallel DDL* mode is enabled
  in a particular → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session.

   The → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects/created-last_ddl_time-timestamp[`created`, `last_ddl_time` and `timestamp`]
   of the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary view → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects[`dba_objects`].

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ddl_locks[`dba_ddl_locks`]
