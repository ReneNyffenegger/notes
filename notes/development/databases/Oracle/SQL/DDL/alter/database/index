$ Oracle SQL: alter database

Oracle apparently considers `alter database` to be a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statement].

{ alter database add standby logfile

code {
alter database add standby logfile ('/path/to/file') size 500M;
code }

}
{ alter database disable thread n

}
{ alter database drop logfile group n


}
{ alter database force logging #force-logging

  Forced logging prevents unlogged direct writes in a database.

  The statement might take a bit of time to complete because it has to wait until all unlogged direct write I/O is flushed.

  A → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Data-Guard/index#dg-primary-db[primary database] in a
  → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Data-Guard[data guard] environment must be running with forced logging.j

}
{ alter database recover managed standby database cancel

  Stop application of *Redo Apply* on the physical → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Data-Guard#dg-standby-db[standby DB].

}
