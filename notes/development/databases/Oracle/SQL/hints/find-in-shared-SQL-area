$ Oracle: Finding (undocumented) hints in the shared SQL area

The following SQL statement tries to find SQL statements with
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[hints] in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache/Shared-SQL-Area. When I wrote
this statement, I hoped I'd find hints that are undocumented.
code {
select
   distinct
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/regular_expressions/regexp_substr(lower(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate/listagg[listagg](t.sql_text, '') within group (order by t.piece)), '/\* *\+[^*]*')
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/text_with_newlines t
where
   piece < 20
group by
   sql_id
order by
   1;
code }
