The `opaque_transform` hint is related to datatype transformations of certain types like object types when the operations take place in the database and is also used for an *insert-as-remote-select* operation on a remote database.

The hint is not intended to interfere with an execution plan.

The following → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[events] can be set on the local database to turn the hint off or on:

alter session set events '22825 trace name context off';
alter session set events '22825 trace name context forever, level 1' ;
code }
