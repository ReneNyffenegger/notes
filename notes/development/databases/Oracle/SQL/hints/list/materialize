$ Oracle hint: MATERIALIZE
@ materialize

`/*+ materialize */` is an undocumented → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints.

-
The hint cause  the result of a query in a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[`with` clause] to be stored in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/global-temporary[global temporary table].
-
Thus, the hint is useful if this result is referred to multiple times in the query. Compare with `cache` and `inline`. Apparently, an inline view is materialized when it uses `rownum`.

  The `inline` and other → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[hints]
