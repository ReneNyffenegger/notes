$ Oracle hint: DYNAMIC_SAMPLING
@ dynamic_sampling

{ Variants

  There are two variants of the hint.

  { Setting sampling level

    The following form sets the → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics/dynamic#ora-dyn-sample-degree[dynamic sampling level] for the duration of a cursor to `n` (an integer value between 0 and 10)
code {
/*+ dynamic_sampling(n) */
code }

  }
  {  

    If the hint has two arguments, the first is a *table reference* (`t`) and the second is a number (`b`).

    When using this variant, Oracle will read («sample») `2^(b-1) * → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/optimizer/dyn_smp_blks` → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block
    to estimate a better selectivity of `where` clauses on the referenced table.
code {
/*+ dynamic_sampling(t b) */
code }

  }

}
rem {
{ Example

code {

create table tq84_dyn_smp (
    a   integer,
    b   integer,
    v   number(5,2)
);

insert into tq84_dyn_smp
select
   level,
   level,
   dbms_random.value(100, 1000)
from
   dual connect by level <= 10000;

explain plan for
select
   sum(v)
from
   tq84_dyn_smp
where
   a = b;

select * from dbms_xplan.display();

drop table tq84_dyn_smp;

code }
