$ Oracle hints: ENABLE_PARALLEL_DML, DISABLE_PARALLEL_DML

Preparation of tables:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/create tq84_src as select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects;
 
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/create tq84_dest (
   id   number,
   own  varchar2(128),
   nam  varchar2(128),
   typ  varchar2( 20)
);
code }
 
 
The following (explained) → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement uses the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/parallel` hint.
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain for
insert /*+ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/parallel[parallel](4) */ into tq84_dest
select
   object_id,
   owner,
   object_name,
   object_type
from
   tq84_src;
code }

The statement's → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[execution plan] places the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/load/table-conventional` operator
«above» the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/coordinator` operator which indicates that `tq84_dest` is not filled in parallel (although the data from `tq84_src` is selected
in parallel).
-
The plan also has the *PDML is disabled in current session* note which confirms this observation:
code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(format => 'basic +note');

code }
 
 
The `enable_parallal_dml` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints is added:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain for
insert /*+ enable_parallel_dml → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints/list/parallel[parallel](4) */ into tq84_dest
select
   object_id,
   owner,
   object_name,
   object_type
from
   tq84_src;
code }
  
This changes the execution plan such that `tq84_dest` is filed in parallel (the `development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/load/as-select/hybrid-tsm-hwmb` operator is now found «below»
the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/px/coordinator` operator).
-
In addition, the *PDML is disabled in current session* note is now gone:
code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display(format => 'basic +note');
