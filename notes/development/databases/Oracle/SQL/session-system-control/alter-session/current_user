$ Oracle: alter session set current_user
@ alter session set current_user


`user_one` creates a table ...
code {
connect user_one/passwordSecretGarden
create table tq84_table_user_one(txt varchar2(20));
code }

... and grants the table to `user_two`:
code {
grant  all on tq84_table_user_one to user_two; 
code }

The user inserts his username into the table:
code {
insert into tq84_table_user_one values(user);
commit;
code }

User two does an analog thing
code {
connect user_two/passwordGardenSecret
create table tq84_table_user_two(txt varchar2(20));
grant  all on tq84_table_user_two to user_one; 
insert into tq84_table_user_two values(user);
commit;
code }

If user two wants to select his own table, he does not need to prefix with his username:
code {
select * from tq84_table_user_two;
code }

However, if he wants to query user one's table, he must prefix it (unless a synonym exists):
code {
select * from user_one.tq84_table_user_one;
code }

If user two finds it tedious to always type user_one's schema, he might choose to set user_one as default schema:
code {
alter session set current_schema = user_one;
code }

The select statement now works perfectly:
code {
select * from tq84_table_user_one;
code }

Note: user_two is still `user_one`. It's not as though he would magically get some extra privileges.
The following statement returns `USER_ONE`, `USER_TWO`:
code {
select user, sys_context('userenv','current_schema') from dual;
code }

Also, if user_two queries USER_TABLES, he finds his tables:
code {
select * from user_tables where table_name like 'TQ84_TABLE_USER%';
code }
