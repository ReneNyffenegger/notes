{ Guarantee of well-formed JSON data

  Data that is stored in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[column] or PL/SQL variable whose data type is `json` is guaranteed to be
  well-formed JSON data.
  -
  However, it should be kept in mind that Oracle has → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/JSON/lax-vs-strict-format[a *lax* and a *strict* JSON format] (lax being the default).

  Compare with the two predicates `is json` and `is not json`.

{ TODO

? The init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/compatible` must be set to `20` in order for this datatype to be available.
