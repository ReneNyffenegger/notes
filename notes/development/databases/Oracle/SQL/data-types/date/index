$ Oracle data type DATE
@ date

A `date` represents a point in time by internally storing integer values for this point in time's year, month, day, minute and second.
-
Internally, the year is stored with a byte for the century and a byte for the last two digits of the year, and the other values each require a byte, the size of a `date` is 7 bytes.

A → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/timestamp[`timestamp`] value differs from a `date` in that it able to store fractional parts of a second.

{ Date literals

  A *date literal* is for example `date '2018-08-28'`. It doesn't allow to specify a time which seems to be because of the Ansi standard. In order to also specify hours, minutes and seconds
  (or microseconds), a *timestamp* literal is needed.
