$ Oracle data type INTERVAL
@ interval

There are two `interval` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] in → development/databases/Oracle:
  • `interval day to second`
  • `interval year to month`

{ Literals

code {

               interval  literals

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/interval[SQL functions related] to the data type `INTERVAL`.

  The function `to_s` of the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/libs/personal/tim[`tim` PL/SQL package] converts an `interval day to second` value to a number that corresponds
  to the amount of seconds of that interval.
