$ Oracle data type INTERVAL
@ interval

There are two `interval` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] in → development/databases/Oracle:
  • `interval day to second`
  • `interval year to month`

{ Literals

code {
select
   --          interval  literals            
   -------------------------------------------------
   interval  '17-9'             year(3) to month       as seventeen_years_and_nine_months,
   interval '-42-9'             year    to month       as minus_forty_two_years_and_9_months,
   interval '1004 14:15:16'     day (4) to second      as approx_1000_days_14_hours_15_minutes_and_16_seconds,

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/interval[SQL functions related] to the data type `INTERVAL`.

  The function `to_s` of the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/libs/personal/tim[`tim` PL/SQL package] converts an `interval day to second` value to a number that corresponds
  to the amount of seconds of that interval.
