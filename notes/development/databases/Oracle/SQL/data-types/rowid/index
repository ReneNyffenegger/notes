$ Oracle data type ROWID
@ rowid

Each record in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database] is identified and located by a rowid.

A rowid includes the address of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block where this record is found.

Because rowids identify the location of a row, they are the fastest way to retrieve a row from a database. Hence,
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] store rowids for the indexed values.

{ Selecting rowids from a table #oracle-select-rowid

 `rowid` is also a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/pseudo which evaluates to a selected record's rowid:

  Reading a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[block] identified by a *rowid* from a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data results
  in a → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name#ora-interesting-event-names[`db file sequential read` event].

  Because a *rowid* identifies a record in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table],
  it is used with the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/exceptions-into[SQL clause `exceptions into`] to write the rowids
  of records that violate a primary key.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/rowid[`dbms_rowid` package] allows to translate the (binary) rowid data into datafile numbers, block addresses and record numbers in the
  those blocks.

  Using a `rowid` to get a record from a table can be identified by the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations[SQL plan operations]
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/by-index[`TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID`] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/table-access/by-user-rowid[`TABLE ACCESS BY USER ROWID`].
