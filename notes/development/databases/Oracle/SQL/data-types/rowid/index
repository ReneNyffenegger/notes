$ Oracle data type rowid
@ rowid

A rowid identifies a record including the address of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block where this record is found. Thus,
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] store rowid.

  Reading a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[block] from a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data results
  in a → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name#ora-interesting-event-names[`db file sequential read` event].

  Because a *rowid* identifies a record in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table],
  it is used with the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/exceptions-into[SQL clause `exceptions into`] to write the rowids
  of records that violate a primary key.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/rowid[`dbms_rowid` package] allows to translate the (binary) rowid data into datafile numbers, block addresses and record numbers in the
  those blocks.
