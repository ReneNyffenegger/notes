$ Oracle data type RAW and LONG RAW

The data types `raw` and `long raw` (as also → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`blob`]) store a sequence of bytes.

The `raw` data type is similar to the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2[`varchar2`] data type, but it is not subject to character conversion
in Oracle Net or import/export utilities.

`long raw` stores binary data up to 2 GB.

`long raw` (as well as `long`) is horrible to manage, especially when their size is larger than 32 KB. Therefore, Oracle (and probably everybody else) recommends to use → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`clob` instead of `long raw`].


~Packages~ related to the raw data types are: `utl_raw` and → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/i18n[`utl_i18n`] (for example the procedure
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/i18n/api/string_to_raw[`utl_i18n.string_to_raw`].

  The return value of `rawtohex` is limited to 32767 bytes. Additional data is truncated.
