$ Oracle data type raw and long raw

The `raw` data type is similary to the `varchar2` data type, but it is not subject to character conversion
in Oracle Net or import/export utilities.

`long raw` stores binary data up to 2 GB.

Oracle (and probably everybody else) recommends to use development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`clob` instead of `long raw`].

~SQL functions~ related to the raw data types are: `rawtohex` and `hextoraw`.

~Packages~ related to the raw data types are: `utl_raw` and `utl_i18n`.
