$ Oracle data type TIMESTAMP
@ timestamp


There are three variants of the `timestamp` data type:
  • `timestamp`
  • `timestamp with time zone`
  • `timestamp with local time zone`

A `timestamp` differs from a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[`date`] that it is able to store fractions of a second. A `date` can only store integral values for seconds.
 
In addition to a `timestamp`, a `timestamp with time zone` also stores a timezone's
  • hour
  • minute
  • region
  • abbreviation

A `timestamp with local time zone` does not store the additional information that a `timestamp with time zone` stores - but it allows to use the `TZH:TZM` or `TZR TZD` format elements.

{ Subtractions

  Most resulting → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] of a subtraction where a timestamps is involved is an `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/interval[interval] day to second`.
  -
  A notable exception is the subtraction of a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/number from a `timestamp` which results in a
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[`date`].

sa:

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions[SQL functions] `ora_dst_error`, `ora_dst_convert and `ora_dst_affected`.

  The function `s_ago` returns the difference, in seconds, between *now* (i.e. `systimestamp`) and a `timestamp`].
