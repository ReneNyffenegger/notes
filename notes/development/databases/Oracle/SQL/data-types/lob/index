$ Oracle data types BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB
@ clob and blobs

Clobs and blobs (commonly referred to as LOBs) are a set of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] that are designed to hold large amounts of data

The → development/databases/SQL-Server equivalent for clob is `text` and `image` for blobs.

{ LOB locator #ora-lob-locator

  A *LOB locator* is a (opaque?) data structure that allows to access the data of a LOB.

  In a database table, the LOB locator is stored with the table rows but the actual LOB data might be stored in a separate storage (usually in a separate
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace).

  An empty LOB locator is returned by → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/lob#ora-func-empty_xlob[`empty_blob()` and `empty_clob()`] or
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob#dbms_lob-createTemporary[`dbms_lob.createTemporary`].

  LOB locators are can be manipulated with the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob[`dbms_lob`] package.

}
{ JDBC #ora-lob-jdbc

  With JDBC 4.0, LOBs should be manipulated with the following interfaces and implementations: (which provide random access to the data)
  table { ll
    ~Interface~ ☰ ~Implementation~
    `java.sql.Blob` ☰ `oracle.sql.Blob`
    `java.sql.Clob` ☰ `oracle.sql.clob`
    `java.sql.NClob` ☰ `oracle.sql.NClob` (In `ojdbc6.jar`)
  table }

  → development/languages/Java/classes/java/sql#java-sql-insert-clob-oracle[This Java/JDBC example] inserts the content of (text-)files into
  CLOBs.
