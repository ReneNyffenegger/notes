$ Oracle data types BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB
@ clob and blobs

Clobs and blobs (commonly referred to as LOBs) are a set of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] that are designed to hold large amounts of data.

`CLOB` stands for *character lob*, `BLOB` for *binary lob*, LOB stands for *large object*.
-
A `BLOB` (as also → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[`raw` and `long raw`]) stores a sequence of bytes that is independent from an
→ development/Unicode/character-encoding[encoding]. a `clob` also stores a sequence of bytes, but unlike in a `blob`, this sequence is interpreted within an encoding.

The → development/databases/SQL-Server equivalent for clob is `text` and `image` for blobs.

{ LOB locator #ora-lob-locator

  A *LOB locator* is a (opaque?) data structure that allows to access the data of a LOB.

  In a database table, the LOB locator is stored with the table rows but the actual LOB data might be stored in a separate storage (usually in a separate
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace).

  An empty LOB locator is returned by → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/lob#ora-func-empty_xlob[`empty_blob()` and `empty_clob()`] or
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob#dbms_lob-createTemporary[`dbms_lob.createTemporary`].

  LOB locators can be manipulated with the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob[`dbms_lob`] package. In fact,
  all procedures and functions of this package must be called with a lob locator.

{ Three types of LOBs #ora-lob-3-types

  There are three types of LOBs:
  table { ll
     Persistent LOBs ☰ The data of persistent LOBs is stored with tables and are subject to → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction[transactions].
     Temporary LOBs ☰ They reside in either a process's → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA[PGA] or → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary[temporary tablespace], depending on their size. 
     BFILEs ☰ The data is stored in a → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[file system].
  table }

  LOBs returned from SQL or PL/SQL built-in functions are temporary LOBs.

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/temporary_lobs` shows a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[session's] number of temporary LOBs.

  { Internal and external LOBs

    Because *persistent* and *temporary* LOBs are stored *in* the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database, they're referred to as *internal lobs*.

    BFILEs, on the other hand, are not stored in a database and are therefore referred to as *external LOBs*.

    Available → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data types] for internal LOBs are `CLOB`, `NCLOB` and `BLOB`.

{ ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error: character string buffer too small #lob-ora-06502

  When concatenating strings (→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2[`varchar2`]) and the resulting length becomes larger than 64 KB,
  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL throws an *→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-06502_PL-SQL-numeric-or-value-error[ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error]: character string buffer too small* error message.

  This error can be prevented when (at least) the first element in such a concatenation is a clob. In the following example, this is achieved using the
 `to_clob(…)` function:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/datatypes/lob/ORA-06502.sql||

}
{ Group by LOB columns not permitted #ora-lob-group-by

  Oracle does not allow to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[group by] LOB-columns:
code {
create table tq84_grpby_clob (
  id number,
  txt clob
);

insert into tq84_grpby_clob values (1, 'foo');
code }

  The following select statement causes the error *ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got CLOB*:
code {
select
   max(id),
   txt
from
   tq84_grpby_clob
group by
   txt;
code }

}

{ JDBC #ora-lob-jdbc

  With JDBC 4.0, LOBs should be manipulated with the following interfaces and implementations: (which provide random access to the data)
  table { ll
    ~Interface~ ☰ ~Implementation~
    `java.sql.Blob` ☰ `oracle.sql.Blob`
    `java.sql.Clob` ☰ `oracle.sql.clob`
    `java.sql.NClob` ☰ `oracle.sql.NClob` (In `ojdbc6.jar`)
  table }
