$ Oracle: Extract lines from a CLOB

{ Using START WITH and CONNECT BY

  Create a table that stores a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`clob`] which is identified by an `id`:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/datatypes/lob/clob/to-lines/table.sql||

  Insert three records. The third insert (`id=3`) creates a clob that is longer than 32K.
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/datatypes/lob/clob/to-lines/data.sql||

  The following → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/hierarchical-queries/start-with_connect-by[`start with` … `connect by`] query extracts the lines
  from the clob in the table:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/datatypes/lob/clob/to-lines/select.sql||

  If selecting with `id = 3`, the error *ORA-01436: CONNECT BY loop in user data* is thrown.
