$ Oracle: ANALYZE TABLE
@ analyze table

{ Most functionlity is superseded by DBMS_STATS

  Although `analyze table` has quite a few options, it should only be used
    • to use the `validate` or → #ora-analyze-table-chained-rows[`list chained rows`] clause
    • collect information on freelist blocks

  The other functionality of `analyze table` is superseded by `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats`.

}
{ analyze table … list chained rows #ora-analyze-table-chained-rows

  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/analyze/table/list-chained_rows.sql||

  The result of this command is inserted into a table named `chained_rows`. Such a table can be created with → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utlchain_sql[`utlchain.sql`].
  -
  Old data in `chained_rows` is not automatically purged by an `analyze table … list chained` command.
