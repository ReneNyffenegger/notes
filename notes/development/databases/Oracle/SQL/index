{ SQL statement execution

  When a SQL statement is executed, development/databases/Oracle checks
  if it has a cached (parsed) version of it to reuse it.

  These parsed representations are stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache.

  If Oracle finds such a parsed statement, it is referred to as *soft parse* or *library cache hit*.
  -
  If not, Oracle parses the SQL statement. This is referred to as *hard parse* or *library cache miss*.
