$ Oracle: The DUAL table
@ dual

`DUAL` is the name of a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables with exactly *one* record and *one* → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns.
The name of the column is `DUMMY` and its value is `X` and its value is `X`.

Although it is possible to delete or update the record, or insert new records, one *really should not do that*.

The owner of `DUAL` is `SYS`, but it is accessibly by every → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users.

{ Purpose of the DUAL table

  The purpose of the `DUAL` table is to let a user evaluate an SQL-expression in an SQL statement.

  { Oracle 23c

    Up to → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c, the value of an SQL-expression could only be calculated in PL/SQL or an SQL statement, however, in
    → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c, it's possible to select an expression simply like so:
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate as this_moment
   7*6     as result
;
code }

  }

}
{ Optimizer

  The → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer «knows» that `dual` has one record only. In fact, when querying an SQL expression from `dual`, Oracle does not physically select
  the record (see the plan operation `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan/operations/fast-dual`):
code {
select → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate from dual;
code }

}
{ Creation of DUAL

  Oracle creates `DUAL` when it installs the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary.
 (`→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/dcore_bsq`)

code {
create table dual                   /* pl/sql's standard pckg requires dual. */
  (dummy varchar2(1))    /* note, the optimizer knows sys.dual is single row */
  storage (initial 1)
/

insert into dual values('X')
/

create public synonym dual for dual
/
code }
}
{ Name

  The name of this table is `DUAL` because it originally contained two rows.

  The table was created by → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Weiss[Charles "Chuck" Weiss] (the 26th Oracle employee?) and was meant to create reports with summaries of DATA and INDEX extents.

  At one point in time, the second (or first) row was apparently removed from this table.
