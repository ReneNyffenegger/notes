$ Oracle: SELECT a random SAMPLE from a table

Select approximately 0.1 percent of the records found in `xyz`:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select
   *
from
   xyz
SAMPLE(0.1)
code }

In order to select the same sample twice (assuming that the records didn't change), the `sample` clause can be combined with a `seed`:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select
   *
from
   xyz
SAMPLE(0.1) SEED(42)
code }

The sample clause logically belongs to the table (or more accuratly to the *query table expression*) so that `where` clauses are applied after determining the sample.

sa:
  The sample clause implements → misc/ISO/9075/features[SQL feature] T613 (but uses `sample` rather than `tablesample`).
