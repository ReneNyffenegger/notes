$ Oracle: SELECT AI
@ select ai

code {
SELECT AI [action]  …;
code }

{ Action

  `action` is one of
  table { ll
    `RUNSQL` ☰ Generated and execute an SQL statement that hopefully does what the prompt requests. This is the default action if `action` is omitted.
    `SHOWSQL` ☰ Shows the SQL statement rather than running it.
    `EXPLAINSQL` ☰ Explains the generated statement in natural language (not `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain`).
    `NARRATE` ☰ Send the result of the executed SQL statement back to the → development/Artificial-intelligence/language-model/LLM and let it describe it.
    `CHAT` ☰ Let the LLM create a response from the prompt without using SQL.
  table }

  See also the `action` parameter of `dbms_cloud_ai.generate`.

}
{ Misc

  An AI profile needs to be set with `dbms_cloud_ai.set_profile`, otherwise, `select ai …` throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00923_FROM-keyword-not-found-where-expected

  Single quotes in the prompt following `select ai` need to be quoted as in ordinary strings:
code {
select ai Who didn''t order anything last month?
code }

  The `AI` keyword is understood by the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` statement only.

  The text after `select ai` is case sensitive.
