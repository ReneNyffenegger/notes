$ Oracle MATCH_RECOGNIZE: Select first row

Some test data:
code {
create table tq84_test_data (id integer, letter char(1));
insert into tq84_test_data
select
   level,
   chr(64+level)
from
   dual connect by level < 10;
code }

Use a *pattern variable* (`ptrn`) that matches each row. Then match as many rows as possible (`ptrn*`), i. e. the entire result set. Apply `first(…)` in the measures clause to return values of the «first» (matched) record:
code {
select
   *
from
   tq84_test_data
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/match_recognize (
   order by id
   measures
      first(id    ) as id,
      first(letter) as letter
   pattern(ptrn*)
   define
      ptrn as 1=1
);
code }

Same result, but different method:
code {
select
   id,
   letter
from
   tq84_test_data
order by
   id
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows#ora-fetch-first-row-only[fetch first row only];
code }
