$ Oracle MATCH_RECOGNIZE: Select first row

The following example demonstrates how `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/match_recognize` can be «abused» to select the «first» record
in a table or resultset.

First, we need some test data:
code {
create table tq84_test_data (id integer, letter char(1));
insert into tq84_test_data
select
   level,
   chr(64+level)
from
   dual connect by level < 10;
code }

In the actual query, we define the *pattern variable* `ptrn` that matches each row (`as 1=1`).
-
Then, in the `pattern` clause, we use the start (`ptrn*`) to match as many rows as possible, i. e. the entire result set.
-
Finally, we apply `first(…)` in the measures clause to return values of the «first» (matched) record:
code {
select
   *
from
   tq84_test_data
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/match_recognize (
   order by id
   measures
      first(id    ) as id,
      first(letter) as letter
   pattern (ptrn*)
   define
      ptrn as 1=1
);
code }

Of course, the same result can be queried with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows#ora-fetch-first-row-only[`fetch first row only`] clause way easier:
code {
select
   id,
   letter
from
   tq84_test_data
order by
   id
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows#ora-fetch-first-row-only[fetch first row only];
code }
