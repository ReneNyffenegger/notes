$ Oracle MATCH_RECOGNIZE: ONE ROW PER MATCH vs ALL ROWS PER MATCH

In the  `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/match_recognize` clause, it is possible to specify if a matched pattern produces one record (`one row per match`) or returns a record for all rows that were
matched (`all rows per match`).

The differences between using these claues is demonstrated with the following example.

First, we need a table with some test data. Especially note that there are four groups where where of «consecutive» values for `nr` (the second and fourth group consists of one row only):
gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/match_recognize/find-consecutive-rows/data.sql||

{ One row per match

  The following query uses `one row per match` (which is the default and therefore not explicitetly stated) to 
  find the first and last (`min` and `max`) `id` of each group of consecutive rows:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/match_recognize/find-consecutive-rows/one-row-per-match.sql||

}
{ Find ALL consecutive rows

  This query specifies `all rows per match` and thus returns more details.

  In order to return a matched groups starting and ending `id`, it also specifies `first(id)` and `final last(id)` in the `measures` clause:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/match_recognize/find-consecutive-rows/all.sql||
}
