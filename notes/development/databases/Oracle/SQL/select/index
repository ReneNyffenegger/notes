$ Oracle SQL: SELECT
@ select

The `select` statement is used to get data stored in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/table[tables].

{ Oracle 23c: No table (dual) required anymore #ora23-select-no-dual

  Prior to → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c[Oracle 23c], the `select` statement required at least one table to select from. In order to evaluate an expression, this table typically was `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual`:
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate as this_moment,
   7*6     as result
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

  With 23c, `dual` is not needed anymore:
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate as this_moment,
   7*6     as result;
code }

}
