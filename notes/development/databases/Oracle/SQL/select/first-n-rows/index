$ Oracle SQL: Select first n rows / rows between n and m (TOP n/LIMIT queries)

At times, it's necessary to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select] the *first n rows* or the rows between n and m (paging) from a table or query.

Here are a few wrong and correct ways to do it.

{ 12c - Row limiting clause #ora-sql-row-limiting-clause

  Other databases made top-n queries quite easy, with, for example, a → development/databases/SQLite/sql/select/limit[limit clause] (such as → development/databases/SQLite or
  a → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/select/top-n[top n] clause in → development/databases/SQL-Server[SQL Server]).

  Oracle, however, did not have a similar clause until → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/12c, what I found, *imho*, quite a nuisance.
  -
  12c, *finally*, comes with the *row limiting clause* which makes it acceptably easy to query the first n records.

  { Test data

    First, we need to create a table with test data:
  
    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/data.sql||

  }
  { Select first row only #ora-fetch-first-row-only

    The `select first row only` does exactly that:

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/12c-first-row.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         1 one        en
code }

  }
  { Select first n rows only

    The `select first n rows only` selects the first n rows.

    In the following example, there's an ambiguity: the third row might be where the `num` 3 is translated to german (`drei`) or where it is english (`three`).

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/12c-first-3-rows.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         1 one        en
         2 deux       fr
         3 three      en
code }

  }
  { Select first 3 rows with ties

    With `select first n rows with ties`, this ambiguity can be resolved

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/12c-first-3-rows-with-ties.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         1 one        en
         2 deux       fr
         3 three      en
         3 drei       de
code }

  }
  { Select m rows starting at the nth record

    With `offset m rows fetch next n rows only`, the n records, starting at the mth record, can be fetched:

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/12c-offset-4-next-2.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         4 vier       de
         5 cinque     fr
code }

  }
  { Select a percentage rather than a fixed amount of rows

    With `fetch first n percent rows only`, it can be stated how many percent of the result set should be returned:

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/12c-30-pct.sql||

  }

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         1 one        en
         2 deux       fr
         3 three      en
code }

}
{ 11g: ROWNUM

  In Oracle 11g, the `rownum` → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/pseudo[pseudo column] was needed.

  { The wrong way

    The following approach is (most probably) wrong (and returns something different than was intended) because Oracle first evaluates the `where` clause,
    *then* adds the pseudo column `rownum` and *then* applies the `order by`. (See also: → development/databases/SQL/operation-order).

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/rownum-wrong.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         1 one        en
         4 vier       de
         6 six        en
code }

  }
  { Inner query

    The following approach is better. With the *inner query*, Oracle is forced to first evaluate the `order by` clause. The result set is *then* passed
    to the *outer query* where the `where rownum` condition is applied.

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/rownum-inner-query.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         1 one        en
         2 deux       fr
         3 three      en
code }

  }
  { Paging - wrong again

    Unfortunately, the approach with the inner query does not allow for paging (selecting rows n through m):

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/rownum-paging.sql||

    This query returns *nothing*!

    This is because `rownum` never reaches 4 because `rownum` only increases when a row is returned.

  }
  { Paging with analytical functions

    Paging, however, is possible with analytical functions, such as `row_number()`, `rank()` or `dense_rank()`.

    gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/top_n/row_number-paging.sql||

code {
       NUM TXT        LN
---------- ---------- --
         3 drei       de
         4 vier       de
         5 cinque     fr
code }

  }

}
