sa:


  With a combination of the set operators → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[`union all`] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/minus[`minus`], it is possible to execute
  an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement that → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/compare-data[compares the data of two tables returns their difference]

  Using a set operator in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views prevents the view from being → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views#ora-updatable-view[updatable].
