$ Oracle SQL: Set operators
@ set operator

The so called *set operators* allow to combine the resultset of multiple → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statements] (queries).

The *set operators* are
  • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union`
  • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all`
  • `intersect`
  • `intersect all`
  • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/minus`
  • `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/minus/all`
  • `except`
  • `except all`

Set operators cannot be used on → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] whose → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data type] is
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`blob`, `clob`], `bfile`, `varray` or nested table.

{ Precedence

  All set operators have equal precedence.

sa:


  With a combination of the set operators → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all[`union all`] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/minus[`minus`], it is possible to execute
  an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement that → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/compare-data[compares the data of two tables returns their difference]

  Using a set operator in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views prevents the view from being → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views#ora-updatable-view[updatable].
