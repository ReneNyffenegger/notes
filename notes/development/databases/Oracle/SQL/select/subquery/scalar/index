$ Oracle: Scalar Subquery
@ scalar subquery

A *scalar subquery* is a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery that returns zero or one row with exactly one column.
-
With this property, scalar subqueries can be used in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] where an *expression* is expected.

If the subquery would return more than one row, Oracle throws the error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01427_single-row-subquery-returns-more-than-one-row.
