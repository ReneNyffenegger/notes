$ Oracle: CONTAINERS clause in SELECT statements
@ containers

`→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` statements using the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/containers[`containers()`] clause are executed in each queried PDB 

If the queried table does not have a `CON_ID` column, such a column is added.

The following select statement is a simple demonstration that `containers` adds the column `con_id` and returns a resultset for every PDB:
code {
select
   dual.dummy,
   con_id,
   con_id_to_con_name(con_id)  con_name
from
   containers(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual);
code }

sa:
  The `containers` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints.
