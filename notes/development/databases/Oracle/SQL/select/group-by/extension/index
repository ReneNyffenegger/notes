$ Oracle: GROUP BY extensions

So-called *→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] extensions* are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by/extension/rollup[`rollup`]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by/extension/cube[`cube`] (produces *cross-tabulation* values)
  • grouping sets

`group by` extensions produce *superaggregate groupings* (or superaggregate rows) in addition to ordinary group aggregates (or regular rows).

→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`SELECT` statement] that contain group by extensions allow to use functions like
  • `grouping` (?)
  • `grouping_id`
  • ?
