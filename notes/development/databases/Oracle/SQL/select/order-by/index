$ Oracle SQL: SELECT - ORDER BY clause
@ order by

It's not possible to order a result set on a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/long[`long`] data type. Trying to do so causes the error message
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00997_illegal-use-of-LONG-datatype.

The behavior of `order by` is influenced by the value of → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/nls#ora-nls_sort[`nls_sort`] (even if `nls_comp` is set to binary, see MOS Note 227335.1).

An `order by` clause might contain → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate functions].

sa:

  Oracle recommends to use → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure/deterministic[deterministic user defined PL/SQL functions] if they're used in `order by` clauses.

  The *SQL work area* in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA.

  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01791_not-a-SELECTed-expression

  Using `order by` in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views prevents the view from being → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views#ora-updatable-view[updatable].
