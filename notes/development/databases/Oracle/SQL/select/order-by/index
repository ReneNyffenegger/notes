$ Oracle SQL: select - order by clause
@ order by

It's not possible to order a result set on a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/long[`long`] data type. Trying to do so causes the error message
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00997_illegal-use-of-LONG-datatype.

The behavior of `order by` is influenced by the value of → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/nls#ora-nls_sort[`nls_sort`].

An `order by` clause might contain → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate functions].

sa:

  The *SQL work area* in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA.
