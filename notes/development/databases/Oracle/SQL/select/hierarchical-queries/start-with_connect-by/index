$ Oracle SQL: hierarchical queries / start with … connect by
@ start with … connect by

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select … START WITH initial-condition CONNECT BY [ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/hierarchical-queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle[NOCYCLE] ] recurse-condition

→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select … CONNECT BY [ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/hierarchical-queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle[NOCYCLE] ] recurse-condition
code }

Oracle's SQL extenstion `start with` and `connect by` can be used to create a query on data that has a hierarchical (parent-child such as superior-employee) relationship among records (that is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/hierarchical-queries).

{ prior clause

  The relationship between the parent record and its child records is expressed by the `prior` keyword:
  code {
  PRIOR child_id = parent_id
  code }

}
{ Interpreting start with … connnect by prior statements

The following sort-of-pseudo code demonstrates how a `start with … connect by` statement might be interpreted.

code {
declare

  procedure RECURSE (rec in MATCHES_SELECT_STMT, parent_id IN field_type) is
  begin

       APPEND_RESULT_LIST(rec);     

       for rec_recurse in (select * from some_table) loop
           if FULLFILLS_CONNECT_BY_CONDITION(rec_recurse.id, parent_id) then
              RECURSE(rec_recurse,rec_recurse.id);
           end if;
       end loop;

  end procedure RECURSE;

begin

  for rec in (select * from some_table) loop
      if FULLFILLS_START_WITH_CONDITION(rec) then
         RECURSE(rec, rec.child);
      end if;
  end loop;

end;
code }

Thanks to ~Frank Trenkamp~ who spotted an error in the logic in the above pseudo code and corrected it.
-
Thanks also to ~Abhishek Ghose~ who made me think about a better way to describe the logic.

}
{ TODO

  With `sys_connect_by_path` it is possible to show the entire path from the top level down to the 'actual' child

  `connect_by_root`, `connect_by_isleaf`, `connect_by_iscycle`
