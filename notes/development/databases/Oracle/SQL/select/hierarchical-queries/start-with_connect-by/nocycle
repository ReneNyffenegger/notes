$ Oracle SQL: hierarchical queries / start with … connect by nocycle

{ A directed graph with cycles

  Here's a directed graph with cycles

  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/directed-graph.txt||

}
{ Create table

  In order to store the graph in Oracle, we create a table:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/create-table.sql||

}
{ Inserting edges

  We insert a record for each edge:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/insert-edges.sql||

}
{ Nodes reachable from F

  The following query selects all nodes that are reachable from F:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/nodes-reachable-from-F.sql||

  The query returns
code {
F->J
 J->G
 J->K
  K->L
  K->M
F->L
code }

  Note: the node `L` is reached via two paths. This is not a problem for the select statement.

}
{ Nodes reachable from A

  Similar query, but now starting from node `A`:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/nodes-reachable-from-A.sql||

  Because there's a loop (`C->H->D->C`), Oracle will throw the error *ORA-01436: CONNECT BY loop in user data.*.

  In order to prevent this error, we'll use the `nocycle` clause:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/nodes-reachable-from-A-nocycle.sql||

  The query returns
code {
A->B
 B->E
A->C
 C->H
  H->I
   I->D
    D->F
     F->J
      J->G
      J->K
       K->L
       K->M
     F->L
code }


  The query works now. However, the edge `D->C` is not displayed! 

}
{ Cleaning up

  Finally, we can clean up:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/nocycle/clean-up.sql||


}
