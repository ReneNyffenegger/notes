$ Oracle SQL: start with … connect by example: recursive additions

This is a hopefully simple example to demonstrate `start with` … `connect by` statements.

{ Create the table

  First, we create a table to hold data with a hierarchical relation ship.

  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/recursive-additions/create-table.sql||

}
{ Fill the data

  The relationshipt among the parent record and its child records is: the sum of all `child` values is equal to the value of their `parent`.

  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/recursive-additions/insert-data.sql||

}
{ Select hierarchically

  Now, we can execute the most basic `start with` … `connect by` sql statement. Note how `start with` clause establishes the condition for all root records and
  how the `connect by` clause establishes the recursion.

  gh|oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/hierarchical_queries/start-with_connect-by/recursive-additions/select-hierarchically.sql||

  The query returns
code {
18
  7
  11
26
  1
  12
  13
38
  6
  15
    5
      2
      3
    10
  17
    8
    9

code }

}
{ Cleaning up

  Finally, we can clean up.

}
