$ Oracle SQL: HAVING clause
@ having

The `having` clause allows to formulate rules which specify which aggregated rows are returned.

With → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c, macros for scalar expressions can be used inside the `having` clause.

{ Order of GROUP BY and HAVING clause

  When combining `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` with `having`, the order in which these clauses appear is unimportant. Both of the following two queries are equivalent:
code {
select
   sum(num)  sum_num,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab
group by
   txt
having
   sum(num) > 0;


select
   sum(num)  sum_num,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab
having
   sum(num) > 0
group by
   txt;
code }

}

sa:
  In order for a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized[materialized view] to be fast refreshable, the query must not have a
 `having` clause.
