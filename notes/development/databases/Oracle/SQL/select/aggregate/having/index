$ Oracle SQL: HAVING clause

The `having` clause allows to formulate rules which specify which aggregated rows are returned.

With → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c, macros for scalar expressions can be used inside the `having` clause.

sa:
  In order for a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized[materialized view] to be fast refreshable, the query must not have a
 `having` clause.
