$ Oracle SQL: DISTINCT and COUNT

gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/aggregate/distinct.sql||

Unlike some SQL implementations found in other → development/databases[databases] (for example → development/databases/MySQL), Oracle does not allow to use a (comma-separated) list
of expressions in the `count(distinct …)` clause. The following statement raises *ORA-00909: invalid number of arguments*:
code {
select count(distinct owner, object_type) from all_objects
code }

This shortcoming is typically circumvented with a subquery:
code {
select count(*) from (select distinct owner, object_type from all_objects);
code }
