$ Oracle: An alternative for LISTAGG to avoid ORA-01489

Oracle's default implementation → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate/listagg[`LISTAGG`] cannot handle agregated values longer than 32K characters and throws a
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01489_result-of-string-concatenation-is-too-long error if this limit is reached.

The following code offers a simple (that is: poor man's) alternative which uses the → development/databases/Oracle/Data-Cartridge/interfaces[Data Cartridge Interface] to create
a → development/databases/Oracle/Data-Cartridge/interfaces/aggregation[user defined aggregate function] which returns a
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`CLOB`].
