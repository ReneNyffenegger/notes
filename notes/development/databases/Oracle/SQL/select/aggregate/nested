$ Oracle SQL: nesting aggregate functions

Trying to demonstrate how → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate functions can be nested]

Table with test data:
gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/aggregate/nested/create-table.sql||

«Normal» `group by` with aggregation:
gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/aggregate/nested/select.sql||

Aggregate aggregated numbers, resulting in one record:
gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/aggregate/nested/select-nested.sql||
