$ Oracle: SELECT with PIVOT clause

code {
pivot [xml] ( → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate-function](expr), … ) for (column…) in (…)
code }

{ Selected columns and implicit group by

  The pivot clause does not require an explicit → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[`group by` clause] to aggregate the values of the expressions in the specified
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggreage-functions]. Rather, the pivot clause implicitely groups on all columns that are not explicitely mentioned in the
  pivot clause.
  -
  This implicit `group by` is performed on all columns that are not referred in in the pivot clause.

  The following table and select statements try to elaborate on that.

  First, we need a table:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/columns_implicit-group-by/table.sql||

  In the following query, the pivot clause refers to the columns `val_1` and `col_1`. These columns
  don't appear in the result set as ordinary columns.
  -
  The `in` clause specifies the names of the additional columns, the aggregate function the column
  that is aggreagated:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/columns_implicit-group-by/star.sql||

  The previous select statement is a bit meaningle because it groups on all availabler columns. Therefore, in most cases, it is advisable to
  select the columns which are grouped by in a subquery:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/columns_implicit-group-by/subquery.sql||

  Finally, it is also possible to specify multiple columns for the additiona columns.
  -
  By default, they have a rather ugly name with apostrophes in them. They can, however, be given more beautiful names:
  gh|Oracle-patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/columns_implicit-group-by/multiple-columns.sql||

}
{ Other examples

  The following examples should eventually be desribed with more text.

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/test_01.sql||

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/test_02.sql||

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/test_03.sql||

  { Two aggregates

    gh|Oracle-Patterns|/SQL/select/pivot/two_aggregates.sql||

  }


}

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/pivot/un[`unpivot` clause].
