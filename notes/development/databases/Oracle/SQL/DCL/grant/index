$ Oracle SQL: GRANT
@ grant

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL[Oracle DCL] `grant` statement allows to give a user or a → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles[role] an
object → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privilege] which is needed for the user or role to access the respective object.

The granted privileges can be queried through the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] views
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/privs[`dba_tab_privs`, `all_tab_privs` and `user_tab_privs`].

A given privilege can be taken away with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/revoke[`revoke`] statement.

{ Grant privileges on columns

  { Create two users

    Create two → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users[users] for an example that is supposed to demonstrate privileges on columns
