$ Oracle SQL example: Bar charts

The following example uses the → development/Unicode characters → https://db.renenyffenegger.ch/IT/Unicode-Character-Database/cp/9608[FULL BLOCK],
→ https://db.renenyffenegger.ch/IT/Unicode-Character-Database/cp/9609[LEFT SEVEN EIGHTHS BLOCK],
→ https://db.renenyffenegger.ch/IT/Unicode-Character-Database/cp/9610[LEFT THREE QUARTERS BLOCK] etc., (found in the → https://db.renenyffenegger.ch/IT/Unicode-Character-Database/block/Block%20Elements[Block Elements] code block)
to create a bar chart from a series of numbers.

The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[`with`] clause defines a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with#ora-with-func[local function] (`bar`) that uses the mentioned Unicode
characters to create a bar whose length corresonds to `val`.

The «magic» value 14849680 is the → development/Unicode/UTF-8 value for the character that follows the 8 characters with which the bar is drawn. So, by subtracting a value between 1 and 8 from 14849680,
I get the block character with the desired width. 

code {
with
   function bar(val number) return varchar2 is
      val_8 pls_integer;
      val_r pls_integer;
   begin
      val_8 := trunc(val/8);
      val_r := val - 8*val_8;
      return substr(
         lpad(
           chr(14849680-8), val_8 , chr(14849680-8)
         ) || case when val_r > 0 then chr(14849680-val_r) end,
         1, 150
       );
   end;
rnd as (
   select
      100 + 100* sin(2*3.14156 / 48 * (level-13)) + dbms_random.value(0,40)  val
   from
      dual connect by level <= 48
)
select
   to_char(val, '990.00') val,
   bar(val)               bar
from
   rnd
/
code }

The result of the statement, When executed in → development/databases/Oracle/SQLcl[SQLcl], is shown below. (I tried the same thing with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus and setting `NLS_LANG` to
`American_America.UTF8`, but the output was not rendered as nicely).
