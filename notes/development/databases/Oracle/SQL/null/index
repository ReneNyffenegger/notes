$ Oracle SQL: NULL
@ null

{ Zero length strings are NULL

  A speciality of → development/databases/Oracle is that it considers a zero length → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2#varchar2-null[`varchar2` to be `null`].
  -
  Unlike in → development/databases/SQL-Server however, a string can be concatenated with the null value without the entire expression becoming null.

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/null-related[SQL functions] related to `null`.

  Because empty strings are equivalent to `null`, it's impossible to create empty → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/JSON[JSON] strings.

}
{ Indexes

  Most → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] do not create an index-entries for rows where all indexed
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] are `null`.
  -
  An exception to that rule are → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/bitmap[bitmap indexes]: the create an entry for all rows regardless of `null` or `not null` values.
