$ Oracle SQL: NULL
@ null

{ NULL is not equal to any other value #ora-null-cmp

  When comparing two expressions and at least one of these expressions is `null`, Oracle considers the expressions to be different.
 (The only *exception* to this rule I can think of is the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/decode` statement).

  Because a comparison that involves `null` is always false, the following statement returns 0:
code {
select count(*) from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual where null = null;
code }

  The undocumented function `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/null-related/sys_op_map_nonnull` allows to mitigiate this nuisance: the following query returns 1:
code {
select count(*) from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual where sys_op_map_nonnull(null) = sys_op_map_nonnull(null);
code }

}
{ Zero length strings are NULL #empty-string-null

  A speciality of → development/databases/Oracle is that it considers a zero length → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2#varchar2-null[`varchar2` to be `null`], the following query returns 1:
code {
select count(*) from dual where '' is null;
code }
  
  Unlike in → development/databases/SQL-Server however, a string can be concatenated with the null value *without* the entire expression becoming null.

  Because empty strings are equivalent to `null`, it's impossible to create empty → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/JSON[JSON] strings.
  -
  It is, however, possible to create → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`clob`] values with an empty string value, see
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/lob#to_clob-ex[this `empty_clob()` example].

}
{ Indexes

  Most → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] do not create index-entries for rows where all indexed
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] are `null`.
  -
  An exception to that rule are → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes/bitmap[bitmap indexes]: they create an entry for all rows regardless of `null` or `not null` values.

  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer allows to configure how `null` values are
  displayed under → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer/GUI/menu/Tools/Preferences/Database/Advanced[Tools -> Preferences -> Database -> Advanced].

  A → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery that returns `null` values to a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/where/subquery/in_not-in[`not in`] operator
  causes the entire query to not return any record at all.
