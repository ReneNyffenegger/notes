$ Oracle JSON: lax vs strict format

With lax format, the following JSON document is valid. It is invalid with strict format because strict format requires names to be quoted.
code {
{
   num: 42
}
code }

The default format is lax.

The difference between lax and strict JSON format only plays a role when using the two predicates `is json` and `is not json`.

The following → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/check[check constraint] makes sure that documents are stored in the strict format:
code {
create table tasks (
  …
  doc varchar(4000) check (doc is json (strict))
);
code }
