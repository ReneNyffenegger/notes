$ Oracle SQL: table(collection)
@ table()

Within an SQL statement, the expression `table(collection)` is treated like a table:
code {
select *
from
  table(collection);
code }

This is demonstrated in → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/collection-types/return-table-from-function[return a »table« from a function].

sa:

  In order to get data stored in a table, the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` statement is needed.
