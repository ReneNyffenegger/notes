{ Physical attribute clause #ora-sql-phys-attr-clause

  The *physical attribute* clause allows to specify the following values:
  table { ll
     `pctfree` ☰
     `pctused` ☰ Ignored in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces] with → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-assm[automatic segment space management] (ASSM)
     `initrans` ☰
     *storage clause* ☰
  table }

}
{ Storage clause #ora-sql-storage-clause

  The *storage clause* allows to specify the storage related characteristics of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[segments] (i. e. the allocated sizes
  of extents etc);

  table { ll
    `initial` ☰ The size of the first → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent when a segment is created. This value is used differently and in conjunction with other values depending on the tablespace's extent manegment configuration.
    `next` ☰ The size of the next extent. This value is used differently …
    `minextents` ☰ In locallly managed tablespaces, the value is used in conjunction with `pctincrease`, `initial` and `next`.
    `maxextents` ☰ Only meaningful in dictionary managed tablespaces.
    `pctincrease` ☰ In locally managed tablespaces, this value is used to determine the initial segment size. 
    `freelists` ☰ Ignored in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces] with → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-assm[ASSM]
