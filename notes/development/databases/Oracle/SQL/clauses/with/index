$ Oracle SQL: WITH clause

{ Local functions #ora-with-func

  A `with` clause allows to declare → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL functions that are local to the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement in which it occurs:
code {
with
   function f (a number, b number) return number is
   begin
      return abs(a) + abs(b);
   end f;
   function g (a number, b number) return number is
   begin
      return f(a-5, b+5);
   end g;
   d as (
     select -4 u,  9 v from dual union all
     select  4 u,  9 v from dual union all
     select -2 u, -8 v from dual union all
     select  1 u,  0 v from dual
   )
select
   u,
   v,
   f(u,v) f,
   g(u,v) g
from
   d
;
code }

  In a `with` clause, the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints[`/*+ materialize */` hint] forces the data that is returned by its → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery to be stored
  in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/global-temporary[global temporary table].
