{ Views where the SCN is found

  In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views[dynamic performance views (`v$…`)] and the
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary], the columns that store SCNs seem to have the form `%CHANGE%#`. Thus, they can be queried with
code {
select distinct
   viw.view_name,
   viw.column_name,
-- viw.table_name,
   com.comments
from (
    select 
       col.owner,
       regexp_replace(
       regexp_replace(
       regexp_replace(col.table_name, '^AWR_[CP]DB_', 'AWR_xDB_')
                                    , '^G?V_\$'     , 'V$'      )
                                    , '^(DBA|CDB)_' , 'DBA_'    ) view_name,
       col.table_name,
       col.column_name
   from
      dba_tab_columns col  join
      dba_objects     obj on col.owner      = obj.owner      and
                             col.table_name = obj.Object_name
   where
      obj.object_type not in ('SYNONYM') and
      col.column_name like '%CHANGE%#'
)                  viw                                left join
dba_col_comments   com on viw.owner       = com.owner       and
