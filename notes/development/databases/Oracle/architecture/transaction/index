{ Committing a transaction

  When a session wishes to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit the changes it made, the redo log entries that belong to that transactions and that are still stored in the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/redo-log-buffer need to be written
  to disk so that is possible to → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery[recovery] the transaction.

  This is necessary because the changes might not yet be written to the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files].

  The redo records are written to disk by the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[Log Writer process (LGWR)].

  When LGWR writes the redo entries to the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files, it also assigns
  an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN to be able to identify them again.

  When LGWR is finished with everything, it notifies the session that the transaction is now securly safed.

  It should be noted that LGWR, in order to reduce I/O, also writes redo log entries of transactions that have not yet been commited.
  In case of a recovery, these can be rolled back.
