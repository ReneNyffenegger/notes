$ Oracle instance
@ instance

An Oracle instance consists of
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background processes] and
  • memory structures.

→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[Server processes] are associated with an instance but are *not* part of the instance.

The main memory structures are
  • System Global Area (SGA)
  • Program Global Areas (PGAs)

When an Oracle Database is *shut down*, there is no instance.

{ System Global Area (SGA)

  The SGA is the (shared) memory that an Oracle instance needs to operate.
  It consists of
    • Shared pool (parsed → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements], system parameters, data dictionary etc.)
    • Flashback buffer (optional)
    • Database buffer cache (stores copies of *data blocks*)
    • Database Smart Flash cache (optional level 2 cache on Solaris and → Linux)
    • Redo log buffer
    • Large pool (optional)
    • In-Memory Area (to store data in the columnar format)
    • Memoptimize Pool (key-based queries)
    • Shared I/O Pool (Secure files)
    • Stream pool (used by Oracle Streams, Data Pump and → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Golden-Gate to store buffered queue messages).
    • Java pool
    • Fixed SGA (stores general information about the state of the database and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instance], and information communicated between processes)
