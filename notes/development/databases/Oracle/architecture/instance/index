$ Oracle instance
@ instance

An Oracle instance consists of
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background processes] and
  • memory structures.

→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[Server processes] are associated with an instance but are *not* part of the instance.


When an Oracle Database is *shut down*, there is no instance.

{ Memory management

  The main memory structures are
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA[System Global Area] (SGA)
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA[Program Global Areas] (PGAs)
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/UGA


}
{ Starting an instance

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/startup-shutdown[Starting an instance] automatically creates the mandatory → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background processes].

}
  

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/instance

  Compare with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[SQL Server instance].

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture

  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance

  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug allows to inspect and change memory in the instance.

  A client needs → development/databases/Oracle/Net to connect to an instance.

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin/oradim[`oradim`] allows to start and stop instances (as well as the corresponding → Windows/services[Windows services]).
  -
  → development/tools/scripts/personal/orastart[`orastart`] is a simple → Windows/PowerShell script that starts both, an instance and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/Listener[listener].
