$ Oracle: X$KSMMEM
$ x$ksmmem

`x$ksmmem` exposes the value of every byte in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA. Therefore the number of bytes in `x$ksmmem` is equal to the size of the SGA as sound in `x$ksmsgmem`:
code {
with ksmmem as (
  select
     count(*) * 8                             size_b,
    (count(*) * 8 / 1024/1024)                size_mb,
     min(to_number(addr, 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')) min_addr,
     max(to_number(addr, 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')) max_addr,
     min(to_number(addr, 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')) + (count(*)-1) * 8 max_addr_calculated
  from
     x$ksmmem
)
select
   ksmsgmem.ksmsgmemval  "Fixed SGA Size",
   ksmmem.*
from
   ksmmem,
   x$ksmsgmem ksmsgmem
where
    ksmsgmem.ksmsgmemnam = 'Fixed SGA Size'
;
code }

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/s/m/fs/v[`x$ksmfsv`] provides the names of variables and the addresses of ther values in the SGA.
