$ Oracle: X$KSMHP
@ x$ksmhp

{ No full table scan

  Querying `x$ksmhp` with a full table scan (like for example `select * from x$ksmhp`) does not return a record.

  In order to find records, it must be quered with a valid heap descriptor (address) on the column `ksmchds`.

  Valid heap descriptors can be found (among others?) in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/cursor[`x$kglcursor`]:
code {
select kglobhd6 from x$kglcursor;
…
00007FFB3D4DDAE0
…
code }

  With such a heap descriptor, the corresponding records can be queried like so:
code {
select
   addr,
   ksmchcom   chunk_allocation_comment,
   ksmchptr   chunk_pointer,
   ksmchsiz   chunk_size,
   ksmchcls   allocation_class,
   ksmchtyp   chunk_type,
   ksmchpar,
   ksmchown,
   indx,
   inst_id,
   con_id
from
   x$ksmhp
where
   ksmchds  = hextoraw('00007FFB3D4DDAE0');
code }

}
