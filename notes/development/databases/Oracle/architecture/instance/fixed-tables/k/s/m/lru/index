$ Oracle: X$KSMLRU
@ x$ksmlru

`x$ksmlru` stores the largest allocations of memory in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool that caused other objects in the shared pool to be flushed out.
-
It might help to identify what caused a large operation.

The contents of this table are erased when it is selected from.

This table always has eight (?) records although the data of the records is reset to zero when this table is queried.

It is unclear to me, if `x$ksmlru` lists the eight *biggest* memory chunks or the eight *most recent* object since this table was last queried.
