$ Oracle: X$KSMLRU
@ x$ksmlru

`x$ksmlru` lists some figures about flushing out of objects from the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool because another object required the flushed out object's memory.

This table always has eight (?) records although the data of the records is reset to zero when this table is queried.

It is unclear to me, if `x$ksmlru` lists the eight *biggest* memory chunks or the eight *most recent* object since this table was last queried.
