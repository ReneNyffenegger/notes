$ Oracle: X$KTFBUE
@ x$ktfbue

Blocks(?) / bitmaps(?) of used extents (i. e. the *extent allocation* of a segment) of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-local-mgmt[locally managed tablespaces].

? When querying `x$ktfbue`, the returned information is read from the corresponding segment header blocks.

sa:

 Extent information of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-dict-mgmt[dictionary managed tablespaces] is stored in
`→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/fet` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/uet`.

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/extents`

 Bug 29275347 seems to indicate that `x$ktfbue` is skipped when executing `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[dbms_stats].gather_fixed_objects_stats`.

 Other → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables[fixed tables] such `x$ktfbfe`
