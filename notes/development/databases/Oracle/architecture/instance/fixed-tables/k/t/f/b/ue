$ Oracle: X$KTFBUE
@ x$ktfbue

Blocks(?) / bitmaps(?) of used extents (i. e. the *extent allocation* of a segment).

? When querying `x$ktfbue`, the returned information is read from the corresponding segment header blocks.

sa:

 Bug 29275347 seems to indicate that `x$ktfbue` is skipped when executing `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[dbms_stats].gather_fixed_objects_stats`.

  Other → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables[fixed tables] such `x$ktfbfe`
