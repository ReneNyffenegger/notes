$ x$comvw$

{ Relation to INT$DBA views

 `x$comvw$` seems to be somehow related to `INT$DBA…` views (which are created with the `sharing=extended data` option):
code {
alter session set events='10053 trace name context forever, level 1';
select count(*) from sys.int$dba_procedures;
alter session set events='10053 trace name context off';
code }

  Find entries in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file:
code {
select
   trc.payload,
   trc.timestamp
from
   v$diag_info inf   join
   v$diag_trace_file_contents  trc on regexp_replace(inf.value, '.*[\\/]', '') = trc.trace_filename
where
   inf.name = 'Default Trace File' and
   lower (trc.payload) like '%x$comvw$%'
order by
   trc.line_number
;
code }

}
