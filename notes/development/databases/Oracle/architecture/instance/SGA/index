$ Oracle System Global Area (SGA)
@ SGA

The SGA is the (shared) memory that an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[Oracle instance] needs to operate.
It consists of
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool (parsed → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements], system parameters, data dictionary etc.)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/Features_Options_Management-Packs/Flashback[Flashback] buffer (optional)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache[Database buffer cache] (stores copies of *data blocks*)
  • Database Smart Flash cache (optional level 2 cache on Solaris and → Linux)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/redo-log-buffer[Redo log buffer]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool (optional)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/In-Memory-Area (optional, to store data in the columnar format)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/memoptimize-pool (optional, for key-based queries(?))
  • Shared I/O Pool (Secure files)
  • Streams pool (used by Oracle Streams, Data Pump and → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Golden-Gate to store buffered queue messages).
  • Java pool
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/fixed[Fixed SGA] (stores general information about the state of the database and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instance], and information communicated between processes)h

{ SGA Granules

? In 9i, the SGA architecture was reengineered with a concepts called *granules*. These allow to relocate memory between areas such as buffer cache and shared pool.

  The size of the granules are dependent on OS, → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions[Oracle version] and size of the SGA (MOS ID #947152.1).
