$ Oracle System Global Area
@ SGA

The SGA is the (shared) memory that an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[Oracle instance] needs to operate.
It consists of
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool (parsed → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements], system parameters, data dictionary etc.)
  • Flashback buffer (optional)
  • Database buffer cache (stores copies of *data blocks*)
  • Database Smart Flash cache (optional level 2 cache on Solaris and → Linux)
  • Redo log buffer
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool (optional)
  • In-Memory Area (to store data in the columnar format)
  • Memoptimize Pool (key-based queries)
  • Shared I/O Pool (Secure files)
  • Stream pool (used by Oracle Streams, Data Pump and → development/databases/Oracle/High-Availability/Golden-Gate to store buffered queue messages).
  • Java pool
  • Fixed SGA (stores general information about the state of the database and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instance], and information communicated between processes)

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga[`v$sga`] can be queried for the actual memory consumption of the SGA.
