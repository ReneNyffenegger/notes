$ Oracle: Large Pool
@ Large Pool

The Large Pool is an optional component of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA. It can be configured to allow allocations of large chunks of memory to
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/UGA (Session memory for shared server and Oracle XA interface
  • I/O Buffer Area
  • Deferred insert pools (for *fast ingest* inserts into → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] defined as `memoptimize for write`)
  • Free memory

The Large Pool (as opposed to the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool) does not have LRU list: allocated memory remains allocated until they are explicitly freed.
