$ Oracle: fixed SGA
@ fixed SGA

The *fixed SGA* contains
  • most latch structures
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/buffer-header[buffer headers] (Really? Some sources indicate they're in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[process] state object
  • session state object
  • …?

{ Size of the fixed SGA

  The size of the fixed SGA does not change. This is probably the reason that the fixed SGA is called *fixed*.

  The size of the fixed SGA can be queried like so:
code {
select
   value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga[v$sga]
where
  name = 'Fixed Size';
code }

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/fixed-views[fixed table] `x$ksmmem` allows to query each address aligned on 8 byte boundaries of the fixed SGA. Thus, the size of the fixed SGA is equal to
code {
select
   8 * count(*)
from
   x$ksmmem;
code }

}
