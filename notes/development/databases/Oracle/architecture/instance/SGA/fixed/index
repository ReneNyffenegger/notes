{ Size of the fixed SGA

  The size of the fixed SGA does not change. This is probably the reason that the fixed SGA is called *fixed*.

  The size of the fixed SGA can be queried like so:
code {
select
   value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga[v$sga]
where
  name = 'Fixed Size';
code }

  The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/fixed-views[fixed table] `x$ksmmem` allows to query each address aligned on 8 byte boundaries of the fixed SGA. Thus, the size of the fixed SGA is equal to
code {
select
   8 * count(*)
from
   x$ksmmem;
code }

}
