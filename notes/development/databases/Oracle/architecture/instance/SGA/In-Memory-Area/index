$ Oracle In-Memory Area
@ In-Memory Area

The Large Pool is an optional component of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA.

If enabled, The In-Memory Area contains the *In-Memory column store* (IM column store).

The IM column store stores → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] and partitions in a format that is optimized for *rapid scans* (especially for → development/Data/OLAP)

{ Dual format

  The IM Column store simultaneously allows to store → development/Data[data] in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache in (traditional) row-format and in the In-Memory Area in columnar-format

  Although the data is stored in two formats, the memory requirements are not doubled.

}
{ INMEMORY attribute

  Some → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Oracle objects] can be given the `inmemory` attribute which adds the object to the IM column store.

  This attribute can be set on
    • tablespaces
    • tables
    • partitions and subpartitions
    • materialized views
    • a subset of columns in that object
  
}
{ In-Memory Compression Unit (IMCU)

  The IMCU is a compressed, read-only storage unit that contains data for one or more columns.

}
{ Snapshot Metadata Unit (SMU)

  An SMU contains → development/Data/metadata[metadata] and transactional information for an associated IMCU.

}
{ Expression Statistics Store (ESS)

  The ESS stores statistics about expression evaluation.

  The ESS is a permanent (not disabable) component of the database. Thus, it is independent of the IM column store and resides in the SGA and also persists on disk.


}
{ In-Memory Expression Unit (IMEU)

  The IMEU is a storage container for materialized IM expressions and user-defined virtual columns.
