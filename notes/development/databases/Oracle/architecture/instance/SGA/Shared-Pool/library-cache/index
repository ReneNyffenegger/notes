$ Oracle: Library Cache
@ library cache

The *library cache* is a component of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool which itself is a component of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA.

The library cache was introduced because → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parsing[parsing], validating and checking privileges of SQL statements is expensive in terms of CPU cycles.
-
The cache stores the results of a parsed SQL statement so that (the same) SQL statement can be executed multiple times (without having to re-parse it).

The library cache consists of
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache/Shared-SQL-Area[Shared SQL Area]
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA/private-SQL-area[Private SQL Area] (Shared Server only, otherwise, the private SQL area is located in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA)
 • → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL objects
 • Control structures (locks and library cache handles)


The library cache is divided into namespaces (or libraries) which can be queried with:
code {
select namespace from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/librarycache;
select kglstdsc  from → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/st;
code }

   In → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions[versions] prior to 10g, using `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats/api/gather/table_stats` would invalidate a cursor (i. e. remove
   the associated data from the library cache and cause a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/parsing#ora-hard-soft-parse[hard parse] for the purged statements.
   -
   This behavior can now be controlled with the paramter → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats#dbms_stats-no_invalidate[`no_invalidate`] of the `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats` packages.

   The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views
     • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/db/object_cache`
     • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/librarycache`
     • `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/subcache`

   The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables[fixed tables] `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/q/l/set` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/xs`
