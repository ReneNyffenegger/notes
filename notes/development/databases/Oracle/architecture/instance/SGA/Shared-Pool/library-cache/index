$ Oracle: Library Cache
@ library cache

The *library cache* is a component of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool which itself is a component of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA.

The library cache consists of
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache/Shared-SQL-Area[Shared SQL Area]
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA/private-SQL-area[Private SQL Area] (Shared Server only, otherwise, the private SQL area is located in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA)
 • → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL objects
 • Control structures (locks and library cache handles)

The library cache was introduced because parsing, validating and checking privileges of SQL statements is expensive in terms of CPU cycles. The cache stores the results so that they can be used with less
resources.

The library cache is divided into namespaces (or libraries) which can be queried with:
code {
select namespace from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/librarycache;
select kglstdsc  from → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/st;
code }

  `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/librarycache`

  `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/subcache`

  `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/q/l/set`
