$ Oracle: Shared Pool
@ Shared Pool

The *Shared Pool* is part of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA. It stores or caches
  • Parsed → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL code]
  • System parameters
  • → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[Data dictionary] information

(Sub-) components of the Shared Pool are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache[Library cache] (stores executable SQL and PL/SQL)
  • Reserved pool (to allocate large (>5 KB) contiguous chunks of memory
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/data-dictionary-cache[Data dictionary cache]
  • Server result cache (for SQL query result cache)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/other-components[Other components] (enqueues, latches, ILM (Information Lifecycle Management) bitmap tables, → development/databases/Oracle/Active-Session-History[Active Session History (ASH)] etc.)

The Shared Pool also stores → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/buffer-header[buffer headers].

{ LRU list

  The Shared Pool uses a LRU list to determine which memory can or should be freed if memory becomes sparse. 

  This is different from the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool which does not have such a LRU list.

}
{ SQL Statements

  All child versions of SQL statements that are stored in the Shared Pool can be queried in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql[`v$sql`].
  -
  The child versions' work area can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/workarea[`v$sql_workarea`].

  Remove all information from the shared pool:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter flush shared_pool;
code }


}
{ Queries

code {
select * from x$ksmsp;
code }

}
