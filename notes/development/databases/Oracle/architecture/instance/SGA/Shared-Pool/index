$ Oracle: Shared Pool
@ Shared Pool

The *Shared Pool* is part of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA. It stores or caches
  • Parsed → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements]
  • → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL code]
  • System parameters
  • → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[Data dictionary] information

(Sub-) components of the Shared Pool are
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/library-cache[Library cache] (stores executable SQL and PL/SQL)
  • Reserved pool (to allocate large (>5 KB) contiguous chunks of memory
  • → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[Data dictionary] cache
  • Server result cache (for SQL query result cache)
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/other-components[Other components] (enqueues, latches, ILM (Information Lifecycle Management) bitmap tables, → development/databases/Oracle/Active-Session-History[Active Session History (ASH)] etc.)

The Shared Pool also stores → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/buffer-header[buffer headers].

{ LRU list

  The Shared Pool uses a LRU list to determine which memory can or should be freed if memory becomes sparse. 

  This is different from the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool which does not have such a LRU list.
