$ Oracle: buffer header
@ buffer header

A *buffer header* is associated with a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache/buffer.

Buffer headers are stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool (although the buffers reside in the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache).
-
(Note: as per *Oracle Insights* by Cary Millsap et al, the buffer headers are in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/fixed (p. 197)).

The buffer header is the primary data structure that is used for *buffer cache management*: it relates
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache/buffer[(memory) buffers] with their actual
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[(disk) data blocks]. A buffer header also
stores the last time that a data block was read from disk.

Some information about each buffer header is exposed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/bh[`v$bh`]
(and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/bh[`x$bh`]).
