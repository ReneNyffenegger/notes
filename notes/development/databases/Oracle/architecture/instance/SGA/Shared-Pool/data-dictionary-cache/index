$ Oracle: data dictionary cache
@ data dictionary cache

The *data dictionary cache* stores → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[information from the data dictionary] in memory because it is crucial for
→ development/databases/Oracle to work properly.

{ Row cache

  The *data dictionary cache* is also referred to as *row cache* because its content is stored in rows rather than in buffers (which stores copies of entire → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data blocks]).

  Hence, in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views, some information about the data dictionary cache can
  be queried from `v$rowcache`.
