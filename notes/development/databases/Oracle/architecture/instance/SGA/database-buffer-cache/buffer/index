$ Oracle: buffer
@ buffer

A *buffer* is a portion of memory within the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache that is used to store a copy of a
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block.

A buffer is associated with a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool/buffer-header. The buffer headers are stored in the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool (rather than in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache).
