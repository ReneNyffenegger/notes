$ Oracle: default pool
@ default pool

The *default pool* is part of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache.

The size of the default pool is controlled by the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#db_cache_size[`db_cache_size` init parameter].

Starting with → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/12c, the default pool has an optional portion, the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache/default-pool/big-table-cache which uses a
temperature-based rather than an LRU-based block replacement algorithm.
