$ Oracle: big table cache
@ big table cache

Starting with → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/12c, the *big table cache* is an optional part of the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache/default-pool that uses a temperature-based, object-level replacement algorithm instead of the
traditional LRU-based, block-level replacement algorithm.
