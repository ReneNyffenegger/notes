$ Oracle instance: startup and shutdown

An → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is started in phases:
  • shutdown (No processes running at all)
  • nomount (instance initialized)
  • mount (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control opened)
  • open (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database opened)

A shutdown has the same phases in reverse order.

{ Shutdown -> nomount

  The following steps are performed when an idle (shutdown) instance is broght to *nomount*:
    • A → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/server-parameter-file is searched.
    • The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA is sized according to the values found in the parameter file
    • The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background processes] are started
    • The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/alert-log is opened

  An instance needs to be in the nomount state to
    • create a new → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database
    • for some → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery[backup and recovery] operations

}
{ Nomount -> mount

  In order to mount a database, the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance opens the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control as specified in the
  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#control_files[`control_files` init parameter].

  A mounted database is closed for ordinary users. Only adminsitrators have access to it for a restricted set of operations.

}
{ mount -> open

  The control file was were opened in the previous step records the locations of the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo log files] that belong to a
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database. This information is now needed to
  open these files.

  If the instance fails to open one of these files or if the *consistency check* is not successful, the instance will issue an error.
  In this case, → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/media[media recovery] is likely.;

  The steps to open a mounted database are:
    • The *online* data files that belong to a non-→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo are opened
    • An → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo is acquired
    • The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo log files] are opened

  Note: It's also possible to open a database in read only mode.

  When a database is opened, the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSTEM[`SYSTEM` tablespace] is always online.

}
{ Shutdown

  { Shutdown modes

    A shutdown can be performed with the following modes
      • `shutdown abort` 
      • `shutdown immediate`
      • `shutdown transactional`
      • `shutdown normal`

    In any of these modes, no new connections are possible.
    -
    With `shutdown normal`, the instance waits for all connected users to disconnect and then shuts down.
    -
    With `shutdown transactional`, the instances waits for all active transactions to finish and then shuts down. A session is not allowed to start a new transaction.
    -
    With `shutdown immediate`, the instance terminates any executing SQL statements, rolls transactions back, disconnects users and then shuts down.
    -
    A `shutdown abort` just terminates the instance.

    All shutdown modes except `shutdown abort` perform a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/CKPT/checkpoint. Therefore, after a `shutdown abort`,
    → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance is required to startup and reopen a database.

  }

}
{ Availability on v$ views

  Not all → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views[`v$` views] are available at the different stages of the startup. For example,
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/instance[`v$instance`] or
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/bgprocess[`v$bgprocess`] are available when the instance is started, but
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/datafile[`v$datafile`] is only available when the database is mounted.
