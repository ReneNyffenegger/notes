$ Oracle: ASM instance
@ ASM instance

An ASM instance is basically the same as an «ordinary» → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[Oracle instance]. However, an ASM instance
requires less resource.

An ASM mounts → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk-group[ASM disk groups] to make
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/file[ASM files] available to database instances.
