$ Oracle Program Global Area
@ PGA

The PGA is (non-shared) memory that is used by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server] (and
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background]?) → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes].

A PGA consists of
  • stack space (session variables, arrays …)
  • hash area (for → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/hash[hash joins])
  • bitmap merge area (to merge data from scans of multiple bitmap indexes)
  • User Global Area (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/UGA) (in dedicated server environments)
  • SQL work area (sort area?), used by → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`]
  • Session memory (Logon information
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA/private-SQL-area[Private SQL area] (Values of bind variables, session specific information for processing etc.)

In shared server environments (as opposed to non-dedicated server environments), the UGA moves into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool because multiple clients share the
same → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server process].

Because the memory of the PGA is not shared between processes, there is no need to protect its data structures with *latches*.

  { Size of PGA and UGA #size-PGA-UGA

    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sesstat[`v$sesstat`] allows to query (among many other values) the size of of
    the PGA:

    The memory chunks of the PGA are selectable from → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/s/m/p/p[`x$ksmpp`] (which has the same structure as
