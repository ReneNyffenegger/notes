$ Oracle Program Global Area
@ PGA

The PGA is (non-shared) memory that is used by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server] (and
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background]?) → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes].

{ Instance PGA

  Each process has its own PGA, the entirety of all PGAs in an instance is referred to as *instance PGA*.

  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[Initialization parameters] related to the PGA set the size of the
  instance PGA, not the size of the processes' PGA.

  Because the memory of a process' PGA is not shared between processes, there is no need to protect its data structures with → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/latch[latches].

}
{ Components of a PGA

  A PGA consists of
    • Stack space (session variables, arrays …)
    • Hash area (for → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/hash[hash joins])
    • Bitmap merge area (to merge data from scans of multiple bitmap indexes)
    • User Global Area (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/UGA) (in dedicated server environments)
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA/SQL-work-areas[SQL work areas],  used by → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`]
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[Session] memory (Logon information)
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA/private-SQL-area[Private SQL area] (Values of bind variables, session specific information for processing etc.)
    • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob#ora-lob-3-types[Temporary LOBs]

  In shared server environments (as opposed to non-dedicated server environments), the UGA moves into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool because multiple clients share the
  same → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server process].

? The init parameter `_pga_max_size` (as per unpublished note 420968.1) limits the per-process PGA size. The default value is 200 MB.
