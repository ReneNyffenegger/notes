$ Oracle Program Global Area
@ PGA

The PGA is (non-shared) memory that is used by both → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background] → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes].

A PGA consists of
  • stack space (session variables, arrays …)
  • hash area (for *hash joins*)
  • bitmap merge area (to merge data from scans of multiple bitmap indexes)
  • User Global Area (UGA) (in dedicated server environments)
  • SQL work area (sort area?), used by → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] and → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`]
  • Session memory (Logon information
  • Private SQL area (Parsed SQL statements, session specific information for processing)

In shared server environments (as opposed to non-dedicated server environments), the UGA moves into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Large-Pool because multiple clients share the
same → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server process].
