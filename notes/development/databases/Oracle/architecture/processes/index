{ Show processes

   On Unix, the Oracle Processes can be listed with something like
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/ps -eaf | → Linux/shell/commands/grep ora
code }

}
{ Foreground and background processes

  While → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background] processes do the work for Oracle itself,
  foreground processes do the work for clients (such as executing → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements]).

}
