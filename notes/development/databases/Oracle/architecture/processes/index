$ Oracle: Process
@ process

{ Show processes

  { With SQL

    The current processes can be queried from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/process`.

  }
  { On the Command line

    On a Unix command line, the Oracle Processes can be listed with something like
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/ps -eaf | → Linux/shell/commands/grep ora
code }

  }

}
{ Foreground and background processes

  While → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background] processes do the work for Oracle itself,
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server processes] (aka foreground processes) do the work for clients (such as executing → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements]).

}
sa:

  A → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA[Program Global Area] (PGA) is created for each
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[server] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background] process.

  Resources that are shared among processes are protected by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/latch[latches] from being corrupted.

  → development/databases/Oracle/internals/process/Windows

  Each process writes some information into a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file.

  The number of processes that were active during the last three seconds can be quried from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/pga/stat`: 
code {
select value from v$pgastat where name = 'process count';
code }

  When a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session process dies, the client is notified with the error message
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-03113_end-of-file-on-communication-channel
