$ Oracle Process Monitor (PMON) background process

The Process Monitor Process* (PMON) periodically checks all → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes] to find any that have died abnormally. 
If it finds such a process, PMON initiates and coordinates the *Cleanup Main Process* (CLMN) and the *Cleanup Slave Process* slaves (CLnn).

PMON runs as an operating system process, and not as a thread. In addition to database instances, PMON also runs on Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) instances and Oracle ASM Proxy instances.

PMON is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background process].
