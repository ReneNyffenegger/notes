$ Oracle: checkpoint
@ checkpoint

A checkpoint corresponds to an SCN in the database's redo thread.
-
The SCN of the latest checkpoint indicates where recovery must start when needed.

Checkpoints are recorded in
  • The control file and
  • Each datafile header

The checkpoint information is written to the datafile headers the control file by the CKPT background process.
-
CKPT also signals DBWR to write blocks to disk.

The information of a checkpoint includes
  • SCN
  • Checkpoint position
  • Location in the redo log (where recovery begins)
  • etc.

Checkpoints are necessary for recovery.

The goals of checkpoints are
  • Reduction of recovery time after instance or media failure
  • Regular writing of dirty buffers from the buffer cache to disk
  • Make sure that commited data is stored on disk during a consistent shutdown
  

A checkpoint is performed
  • When redo log files switch
  • When the value specified in `log_checkpoint_timeout` is reached
  • When the amount of bytes in the current redo log reaches `log_checkpoint_interval * IO OS blocks`.
  • `alter system switch logfile`
  • `alter system checkpoint`
rem {
   • When an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is shutdown (except for `shutdown abort`)
rem }
