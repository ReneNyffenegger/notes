$ Oracle Checkpoint Process (CKPT) background process

? At specific times, the *Checkpoint Process* requests a checkpoint be made by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/DBWn[`DBWn`]. When DBWn is finished with the checkpoint,
CKPT updates the data file headers and control files with the most recent checkpoint.

? CKPT also wakes up every three seconds to check if the amount of memory exceeds the value configured in the
→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#pga_aggregate_limit[`pga_aggregate_limit` init parameter].

CKPT is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background process] (but can also run as a thread).
