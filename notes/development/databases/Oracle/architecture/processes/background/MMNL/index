$ Oracle Manageability Monitor Lite Process (MMNL)

The *Manageability Monitor Light process* collects statistics about *active* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions] and stores them in the *Active Session History* (ASH) buffer.

These statistics include values such as
  • user id,
  • state,
  • machine,
  • SQL text
 
Some data is also collected from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] and → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/wait[`v$session_wait`] views.

The ASH is a rolling buffer in memory: new data overwrites old data when the buffer is full. However, before the old data is overwritten, → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/MMON takes a snapshot
and  MMNL flushes (every 10th record of) the ASH buffer into the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist/active_sess_history[`dba_hist_active_sess_history`] view in the AWR.


MMNL is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background process].
