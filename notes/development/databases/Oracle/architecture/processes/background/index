$ Oracle background processes
@ background process

The background → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes] are part of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA.

Each background process is designed to perform a specific taks. They work with each other. Many processes also operate on *data files*. 

There are mandatory and optional processes.

The mandatory background processes are created when a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is started.

Background processes have `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[v$session].type = BACKGROUND`.
