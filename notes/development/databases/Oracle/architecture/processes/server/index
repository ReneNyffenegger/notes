$ Oracle: Server Processes

A server process is an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[Oracle process] that communicates with a client (aka client process).

Server processes are associated with an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instance], but they are not part of the instance.

Server → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes] are also referred to as *foreground processes* (as opposed to
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background processes]).

A server process does not write directly into a *database file*. Instead, it writes into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache and
lets background processes do file I/O.
(But see also → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache#buffer-cache-direct-path[bypassing the buffer cache with *direct path* inserts and reads]).
