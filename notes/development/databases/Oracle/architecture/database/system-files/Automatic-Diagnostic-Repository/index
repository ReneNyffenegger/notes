$ Oracle Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR)
@ ADR

The *Automatic Diagnostic Repository* is a file-based hierarchical repository for diagnostic data, especially network tracing and database logging).

The ADR consists of the following diagnostic data:
  • Background and foreground → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[trace files]
  • Dump files (a special trace file that contains the point-in-time information about a state or structure)
  • Health monitor reports (Detection of data corruptions)
  • Incident packages
  • Incident dumps
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/alert-log

{ ADR base and ADR home #oracle-adr-base

  *ADR home* is the root directory where an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance stores its diagnostic data.

   All *ADR home* directories are subdirectores of a (single) *ADR base* directory. The *ADR base* directory might hence be viewed as an ADR root directory.

   In a → development/databases/Oracle/Options/real-application-clusters[RAC] environment, each participating
   → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance and ASM have their own *ADR home*.

   The location of the *ADR base* directory is specified by the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[initialization parameter] `diagnostic_dest`.

}

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[Trace files] that are currently available in the ADR are listed in
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/diag/trace_file[`v$diag_trace_file`].

  Don't confuse the ADR with the → development/databases/Oracle/Automatic-Workload-Repository[AWR]

  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/ADRCI

  The state of the ADR is exposed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/diag/info[`v$diag_info`]
