{ LOGGING and NOLOGGING

  Certain operations that change data can be executed with `LOGGING` or `NOLOGGING`. If performed with `NOLOGGING`, *no* redo data will be generated.

  The operations where the logging clause can be applied are the
  `create` and `alter` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL statements] for the following objects:
    • table
    • index
    • materialized view
    • materialized view log
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace
    • pluggable database

  Two special statements where it can applied are also
    • `create index … rebuild`
    • `alter table … move`

  NOLOGGING can also be used in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache#buffer-cache-direct-path[direct path inserts] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader.

  The `NOLOGGING` clause is ignored if the respective → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] is located in a
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database or → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace with
  *force logging*.

  Operations on objects in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/temp[temp file] are always executed with NOLOGGING.
