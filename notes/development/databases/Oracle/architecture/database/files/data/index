$ Oracle database: Data file
@ data file

The locations of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database's] data files are recorded in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control.

? The data file stores the last checkpoint SCN.

→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/image-copy[Image copies] of a data file might be stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area.

In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary, data files are listed under → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/data_files[`dba_data_files`].


{ Permanent and temporary data files

  Oracle distinguishes between
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data/permanent[permanent data files] and
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data/temp[temporary data files]

}
{ Online and offline data files

  A data file is either online or offline.

  The data in an offline data file cannot be accessed until it is brought online.

  Reasons to take a data file offline:
    • Offline → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup[backups]   
    • Fixing → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block/corruption

  Oracle will automatically bring a data file offline if it cannot write to it anymore.

}
{ Alloction unit blocks

  The *data file* is a *physical* file. When Oracle needs to allocate more space for a data file, that is, to grow the physical file, it does so by allocating that space in the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[logical units] of
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data blocks].

  The maximum number of data blocks that can be allocated for a data file is operating system dependent, typically, it is 2²²-1 blocks.

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data/header

  The maximum number of data files that can be opened in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database is specified with the
  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#db_files[`db_files` init parameter]. Regardless of this parameter's value,
  it cannot be more than 65533 data files.

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data/checkpoint

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/space[dbms_space].isdatafiledroppable_name` checks if a data file can be dropped.

  The *maximum number of data files* is recorded in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/high_ater_mark_statistics`.
