@ data file checkpoint

Each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data has a checkpoint. This checkpoint is basically
an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN.

The datafile checkpoint guarantues that the data that was changed by commited transactions with an SCN that is lower than the data file checkpoint is stored in the data file.

The SCN of the data file checkpoint can be queried from the column `checkpoint_change#` in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/datafile[`v$datafile`].

A datafile checkpoint is stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data/header.
