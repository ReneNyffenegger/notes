@ data file checkpoint

Each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data has a checkpoint. This checkpoint is basically
an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN.

The datafile checkpoint guarantues that the data that was changed by committed → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction[transactions]
with an SCN that is lower than the data file checkpoint is stored in the data file.

The SCN of the data file checkpoint can be queried from the column `checkpoint_change#` in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/datafile[`v$datafile`].

A datafile checkpoint is stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data/header.
