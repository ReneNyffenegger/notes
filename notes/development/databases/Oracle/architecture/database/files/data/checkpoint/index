$ Oracle: datafile checkpoint
@ data file checkpoint

Each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data has a checkpoint. This checkpoint is basically
an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN. All commited transactions with an SCN that is lower than the data file checkpoint is guaranteed to be stored
to the data file.

The SCN of the data file checkpoint can be queried from the column `checkpoint_change#` in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/datafile[`v$datafile`].
