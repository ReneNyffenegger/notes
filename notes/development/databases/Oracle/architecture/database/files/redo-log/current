$ Oracle: current redo log file
@ current redo log file

The *current* redo log file is the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log that → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[LGWR] is currently writing to.
Only *one* log file is currently being written to at a specific time. (Note: although only one redo log file is written to, the log file's content can be multiplexed to multiple physical files,
see → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/group])

When the current log file is filled up, a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/switch is initiated which
  • closes the current log file
  • opens the next log file which becomes the new current log file
  • increases the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log/sequence[log sequence number] and assigns the new sequence number to the new current log file
