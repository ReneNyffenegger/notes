$ Oracle: redo log sequence
@ redo log sequence

The redo log sequence is an ever increasing number that uniquely identifies each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log[redo log file].

The log sequence is increased when a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/switch is performed.

The current sequence number is stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control. 

? If the database is opened with `resetlogs`, the sequence number is reset to 1.
