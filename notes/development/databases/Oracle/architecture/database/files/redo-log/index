$ Oracle: redo log file
@ log file

A *redo log file* might either be
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online] or
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived]

{ Identification of log files

  Each redo log file is assigned a sequence number in every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/switch[log switch].

  Thus, each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived] log file is uniquely identified by the sequence number.

  The history of log files is found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/log/history[`v$log_history`].
