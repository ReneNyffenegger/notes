$ Oracle: redo log file
@ log file

A *redo log file* might either be
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online] or
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived]

Oracle (that is: → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[LGWR]) writes to *one* redo log file at a time. This specific log file is called the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log/current[current log file].


{ Identification of log files

  Each redo log file is assigned a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log/sequence[sequence number] in every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/switch[log switch].

  Thus, each → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online] and
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived] log file is uniquely identified by the sequence number.
