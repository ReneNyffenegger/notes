@ control file

Every Oracle → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database needs a control file.
-
The controlfile is a small binary file that stores some important characteristics of the database:
  • database name
  • database creation timestamp
  • names and locations (filesystem paths) of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo log files]

The control file is created by the `create database` statement.
