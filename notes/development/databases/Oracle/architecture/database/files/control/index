$ Oracle control files
@ control file

Every Oracle → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database needs a control file.
-
The controlfile is a small binary file that stores some important characteristics of the database:
  • database name
  • database unique identifier (DBID)
  • database creation timestamp
  • names and locations (filesystem paths) of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo log files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log[archived redo log files]
  • information about → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces]
  • last checkpoint → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN
  • (?) history of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/switch[log switches]
  • (?) the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log/sequence
Additionally, → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN[RMAN] uses the control file to store a history of → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery[backup] → development/Data/metadata.

The control file is created by the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database[`create database`] statement.

(Multiplexed) copies of the control file might be stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area.


{ Purpose

  The control file contains the necessary information to *open* a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database such as the location of
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[redo log files])
  -
  Thus, when an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/startup-shutdown[started up], it first goes through a phase
  when the control files are opened but the database is still closed.

  A control file also contains the information that is required to recover a database (such as checkpoints).

{ Default location of control files

  The default location for control files can be found with
code {
select
   default_value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter[v$parameter]
where
   name = 'control_files';
code }

}

{ Dictionary views

  Some dictionary views that are related to control files are:
  table { ll

    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database[`v$database`] ☰ This view displays some (most, all?) of the information that is stored in the control file.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/controlfile[`v$controlfile`] ☰ Shows the physical location of the control files.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/controlfile/record_section[`v$controlfile_record_section`] ☰ Shows the sections that are stored in a control file.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter[`v$parameter`] ☰ `select value from v$parameter where name = 'control_files'` to get the locations of the control files as specified with the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#control_files[`control_files` init parameter].

  table }

}

{ RMAN commands

  → development/databases/Oracle recommends to turn on autobackup on for control files:  
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure controlfile → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure/autobackup on;
code }

code {
configure controlfile autobackup format for device type disk to 'controlfile_%f';
code }

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/restore controlfile from autobackup;
code }
  
}
{ Dumping the contents of a control file to a trace file #ora-controlfile-dump

  The entries of a control file can be dumped to a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file[trace file]
  by setting the following event:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session[alter session] set events 'immediate trace name controlf level 10';
code }

  Alternatively, it can also be dumped with → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/dump/controlf[`oradebug dump controlf`].

}


sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[Oracle files]

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/controlfile

  This kind of control files is not the same thing as the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader/control-file[control files] needed by
  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader.
