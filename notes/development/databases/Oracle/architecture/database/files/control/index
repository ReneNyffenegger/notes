$ Oracle control files
@ control file

Every Oracle → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database needs a control file.
-
The controlfile is a small binary file that stores some important characteristics of the database:
  • database name
  • database creation timestamp
  • names and locations (filesystem paths) of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[online redo log files]
  • (?) last checkpoint SCN
Additionally, → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN[RMAN] uses the control file to store a history of → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery[backup] → development/Data/metadata.

The control file is created by the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database[`create database`] statement.

A control file might be stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area.

{ Default location of control files

  The default location for control files can be found with
code {
select
   default_value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter[v$parameter]
where
   name = 'control_files';
code }

}

{ Dictionary views

  Some dictionary views that are related to control files are:
  table { ll

    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database[`v$database`] ☰ This view displays some (most, all?) of the information that is stored in the control file.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/controlfile[`v$controlfile`] ☰ Shows the physical location of the control files.
    `v$control_record_section` ☰ Shows the sections that are stored in a control file.
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter[`v$parameter`] ☰ `select value from v$parameter where name = 'control_files'` to get the locations of the control files as specified with the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#control_files[`control_files` init parameter].

  table }

}
