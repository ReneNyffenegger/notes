$ Oracle: redo log file group
@ redo log file group

When the *current* redo log file group is filled up, a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/switch is necessary.

Although a log file group might consist of multiple files, Oracle's documentation usually refers to a group as a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log[log file]. This makes sense given that each
member in a group is (at least in theory) identical.

{ Log group status

  table { ll

    `UNUSED`           ☰ 1) The group was never written to. 2) After a `RESETLOGS` for non-current groups.
    `CURRENT`          ☰ The group that is written to by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR. A current group is also active.
    `ACTIVE`           ☰ A group that may be used for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/crash
    `CLEARING`         ☰ Log is being cleared after an `alter database clear logfile` statement
    `CLEARING_CURRENT` ☰
    `INACTIVE`         ☰ Log is no longer needed for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance. It might be used for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/media.
