$ Oracle online redo log files
@ online redo log file

The *online redo log files* are needed for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance and → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/media.


The *online redo log file* contains → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data (which is a stream of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data/record[redo records]).

The online redo log files are created by the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database[`create database`] statement.

The location of the redo log files is specified with the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/log_archive_dest_n[log_archive_dest_n] init parameter and
stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control file].

The redo log files might be stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area.

{ Log file groups and group members


  Every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database] has as least two → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/group[redo log file groups].

  Each group has at least one → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/member[member]. Each member is a
 *physical* file.

  The entirety of these log files (all members) are referred to as ~log files~.

  Exactly *one* group is *current*. This is the gruop to whose members the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[Logwriter Process (LGWR)] writes
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data.

  A → development/databases/DBA might decide to have multiple members in a group and store each member on different disks for redundancy reasons. Thus, if one disk fails or one of the members becomes corrupt, there is still
  another log file with the precious data needed for recovery.

  Each log file group is recorded in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/log[`v$log`]. All members are recorded in
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/log/file[`v$logfile`].


}
{ Active and inactive redo log files

  An active log file might be needed for (a possibly future) → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance.

}
{ Analyzing the redo log

  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/LogMiner[Oracle LogMiner] exposes an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL] interface to analyze the entries in the redo log files.

}
{ Size of redo log file

  The minimum size of a redo log file is 4 MB. The maximum size is operating system dependent, typically 2 TB.
