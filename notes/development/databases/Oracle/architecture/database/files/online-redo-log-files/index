$ Oracle online redo log files
@ redo log

The *online redo log files* are needed for *instance recovery* and *media recovery*.

Every → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[database] has as least two *online redo log files*. The entirety of these log files are referred to as ~log files~.

The online redo log files are created by the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database[`create database`] statement.

The location of the redo log files is specified with the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/log_archive_dest_n[log_archive_dest_n] init parameter and
stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control file].

The redo log files might be stored in the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area.

{ Log file groups

  Usually, the log files are multiplexed, that is: stored redundantly. This protects against corruption of the redo log files themselves.

  Ideally, each group has identical copies of the log files.


}
{ Active and inactive redo log files

  An active log file might be needed for (a possibly future) → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/instance.

}
{ Analyzing the redo log

  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/LogMiner[Oracle LogMiner] exposes an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL] interface to analyze the entries in the redo log files.
