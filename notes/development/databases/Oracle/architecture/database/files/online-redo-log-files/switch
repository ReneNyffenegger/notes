$ Oracle: log switch
@ log switch

A *log switch* occurs when the *current* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log is filled up.

In a log switch, a new → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/redo-log is created. This is the log file
that  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[`LGWR`] will now write to until the next log switch.

Although a new *log file* is created, no new → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files is created. Rather, some already existing online redo log files are recycled.

The log switch assigns a unique sequence number to the new log file that will hence forth be needed to identify the log file, mainly in
→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery processes.


sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files/group[redo log group].
