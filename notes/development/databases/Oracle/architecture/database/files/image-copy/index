$ Oracle: image copy
@ image copy

An *image copy* is an bitwise exact copy of one of the crucial → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[database files]
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data,
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control or
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/archived-redo-log.

? Image copies are usually used for restoration (recovery?) of these files.

Image copies are created with
  • standard OS utilities such as Linux/shell/commands/cp[`cp`] or
  • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN (→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/backup[`backup AS COPY database`])
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/ARCn[Archiver process]

Image copies cannot be written into a → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set, they can only be written to disk.

{ RMAN commands

code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure[configure] → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/commands/configure#rman-configure-device-type[device type] disk backup type to copy;
code }

}

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/backup-set
