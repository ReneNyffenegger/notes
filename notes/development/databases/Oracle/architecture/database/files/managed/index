$ Oracle managed files (OMF)

The goal of *Oracle managed files* is to simplify the work of a → development/databases/DBA. With OMF, → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[files needed by Oracle] are automatically
created (named and stored in a location) and deleted.
-
With OMF enabled, the following database structures are managed by OFM
  • Data files
  • Redo log files
  • Control files
  • Archived logs
  • Block chaning tracking files
  • Flashback logs
  • RMAN backups

Files that are controlled by OFM include
  • Trace files
  • Audit files
  • Alert logs
  • Core files
  • Password files (?)

The following three → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameters] enable OMF:
table { ll
  `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/create/file_dest` ☰
  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/create/online_log_dest_[`db_create_online_log_dest_{1…5}`] ☰ Allows to override the location of `db_create_file_dest` for redo log files and control files
  `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/recovery_file_dest` ☰ Fast recovery area
table }


? OMF can be used on top of traditional → Linux/filesystem/filesystems such as VxFS or ODM.

OMF can be used with the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/recovery/fast-recovery-area.
