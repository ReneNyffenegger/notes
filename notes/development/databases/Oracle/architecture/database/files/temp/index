$ Oracle database: temp file
@ temp file

*Temp files* are similar to → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files]. They differ in the following points
  • They don't store permanent → development/databases/Oracle/objects[objects] such as → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables]
  • Temp files are in `NOLOGGING` mode and therefore don't generate → /development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data.
