$ Oracle ASM file
@ ASM file

An *ASM file* is a file that is stored in a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk-group.

ASM file names begin with a plus symbol (`+`) followed by the name of the disk group it belongs to. It's possible to create *user friendly* aliases for ASM file names. These aliases
can have a hierarchical like structure.

It is awkward to manipulate files under ASM.
