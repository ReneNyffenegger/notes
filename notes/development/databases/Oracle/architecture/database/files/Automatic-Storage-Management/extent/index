$ ASM extent
@ extent

An extent is stored on a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk in its entirety.

The sizes of the extents are variable.

An extent consists of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/allocation-unit[allocation units (AU)].

An (ASM) extent must not be confused with the (logical) → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[extents] that are allocation units for
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[(data) segments].
