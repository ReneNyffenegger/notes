{ Allocation Units (AU)

  Every ASM disk is divided into allocation units (AU).
 
  The AU is the fundamental allocation unit on an ASM disk.

  A → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/file[file] extent consists of one or more AUs, a
  file consists of one or more file extents.

  The size of the disk's AUs are set with the disk group attribute `AU_SIZE`. Possible values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 MB.
  -
  → development/Data/warehouse[Data warehouses] and → development/Data/OLAP[OLAP] environments tend to have larger AUs because they
  have large sequential reads.
