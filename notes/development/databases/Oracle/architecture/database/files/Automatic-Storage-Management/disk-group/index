$ Oracle ASM disk group
@ ASM disk group

An ASM disk group is the fundamental object that → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management manages.

ASM disk groups consist of multiple → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk[disks].

ASM disk groups store → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/file[(ASM) files], possibly from various → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[databases].
-
The contents of the files are distributed in a way that eliminates hot spots and provides balanced I/O across the disks.

{ Redundancy levels

  A disk group can be created with one of three redundancy levels:
    • Normal (2-way mirroring)
    • High (3-way mirroring)
    • External (do not use ASM mirroring)

  the redundancy level determines the number of tolerated disk failures before the diskgroup is unmounted.

  Each disk group stores the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/Automatic-Storage-Management/disk-group/metadata[metadata] it needs to manage the space on its disks.
