$ Oracle Database Service

A *Database Service* represents a single → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database, either a single-instance database or a Real Application Cluster database.

A connection request typically specifies a database service name. If no such name is specified, the default service name found in the `listener.ora` file is used.

{ Edition attribute

  A service can be given an *edition* attribute which causes subsequent sessions connecting with this service to use this edition.

}
{ Internal services

  Oracle maintains two *internal* services:
    • `SYS$BACKGROUND` and
    • `SYS$USERS`

  These services are used by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background[background processes] and user sessions that are not associated with a service.

}
{ Global Database Service

  A *global database service* is a service provided by multiple databases synchronized through data replication.
