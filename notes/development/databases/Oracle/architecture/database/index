$ Oracle Database
@ database

A database can be designed as a multitenant container database (CDB) or a non-container database (non-CDB)

{ Physical and logical storage structures

  An Oracle database consists of physical and logical components.

  { Physical components

    The physical components are files in a file system.
    These files store
      • data and
      • metadata.
  
     The data is what is precious to a user. It is inserted, updated and deleted with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statements] and queried with
     → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statements].
  
     The metadata stores information about the database server. It is used by the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance for proper operation.

     The physical files are
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[Data files]
       • Control files
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[Online redo log files]

     The physical files are created with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database[`create database`] statement. Additional data files can later be added.


   }
   { Logical structures

     Logical components are not visible in the operating systems. They are
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[Data blocks]
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[Extents]
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[Segments]
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[Tablespaces]

   }

}
{ Opening a database

  
  A database cannot be opened if online data needs *media recovery*.

}
{ Tablespace

  The physical data files that store the *data* is logically abstracted by tablespaces. That is, a tablespace represents one or more data files.


}
{ Protected database

  A *protected database* is a database that backs up to a *Recovery Appliance*.

}
{ CDB

  A CDB consists of
    • One CDB root container (also *the root*, named `CDB$ROOT`)
    • exactly one seed pluggable database (aka *seed PDB*, named `CDB$SEED`)
    • zero or more user-created pluggable databases (PDBs), and
    • zero or more application containers

  The entire CDB ecosystem is referred to as the *system container*.

  To a user or application, PDBs appear as separate databases.

}
{ Misc

  A database maintains a list of → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[database users].
