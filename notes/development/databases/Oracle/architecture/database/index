$ Oracle Database
@ database

A database can be designed as a multitenant container database (CDB) or a non-container database (non-CDB)

{ Database name #ora-db-name

  When a database is created, it can or will be given a *database name*.

  This name is stored (among other information) in the database's → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/control[control files].

  The database name must match the value of the `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/name` init → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[parameter].].

  The maximal length of the database name is eight → development/Unicode/ASCII characters (or bytes).

}
{ Database ID

  When a database is created, Oracle calculates a numerical database identifier (DBID).

}
{ Physical and logical storage structures

  An Oracle database consists of physical and logical components.

  { Physical components (files)

    The physical components are files in a file system.
    These files store
      • data and
      • metadata.
  
     The data is what is precious to a user. It is inserted, updated and deleted with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statements] and queried with
     → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statements].
  
     The metadata stores information about the database server. It is used by the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance for proper operation.

     The physical files are
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[Data files]
       • Control files
       • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[Online redo log files]

     The physical files are created with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL/create-database[`create database`] statement. Additional data files can later be added.


   }
  { Logical structures

    Logical components are not visible in the operating system. They are
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[Data blocks]
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[Extents]
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[Segments]
      • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[Tablespaces]

  }
}
{ Opening a database
  
  A database cannot be opened if online data needs *media recovery*.

}
{ Tablespace

  The physical data files that store the *data* is logically abstracted by tablespaces. That is, a tablespace represents one or more data files.

}
{ Protected database

  A *protected database* is a database that backs up to a *Recovery Appliance*.

}
{ CDB

  A CDB consists of
    • One CDB root container (also *the root*, named `CDB$ROOT`)
    • exactly one seed pluggable database (aka *seed PDB*, named `CDB$SEED`)
    • zero or more user-created pluggable databases (PDBs), and
    • zero or more application containers

  The entire CDB ecosystem is referred to as the *system container*.

  To a user or application, PDBs appear as separate databases. 

  See also → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/multitenant[multitenant architecture].

}
{ Misc

  A database maintains a list of → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[database users].

}
sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files

  The value of `ORA_<sid>_AUTOSTART` in the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ORACLE/KEY_homename[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_homename`]

  The control file that is used for the database is not the same thing as the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader/control-file[control file (ctl)] that is used by
  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader.

  A database is either in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/archiving-mode[archivelog or noarchivelog mode].

  The *maximum number of bytes of the (current) database* is recorded in
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/high_ater_mark_statistics`.

  The fundamental → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] to store → development/Data in a database is a
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables.

  A → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/service[database service] represents a single-database.
