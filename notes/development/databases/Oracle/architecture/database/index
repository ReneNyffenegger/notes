An Oracle database consists of physical files that store
  • data and
  • metadata.

The data is what is precious to a user. It is inserted, updated and deleted with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statements] and queried with
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[`select` statements].

The metadata stores information about the database server. It is used by the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance for proper operation.

A database can be designed as a multitenant container database (CDB) or a non-container database (non-CDB)

{ Tablespace

  The physical data files that store the *data* is logically abstracted by tablespaces. That is, a tablespace represents one or more data files.

{ CDB

  A CDB consists of
    • One CDB root container (also *the root*, named `CDB$ROOT`)
    • exactly one seed pluggable database (aka *seed PDB*, named `CDB$SEED`)
    • zero or more user-created pluggable databases (PDBs), and
    • zero or more application containers

  The entire CDB ecosystem is referred to as the *system container*.

  To a user or application, PDBs appear as separate databases. 

  See also *multitenant architecture*.
