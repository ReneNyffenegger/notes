$ Oracle: data block corruption
@ data block corruption

If a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block is not in a recognized Oracle format or is internally incosistent, then the
data block is said to be *corrupt*.

? If only a few data blocks are found to be corrupt, it might be advisable to repair them with *block recovery* rather than *data file recovery*.

→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[Data blocks] that were corrupted since the last
→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup are recorded in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database/block_corruption[`v$database_block_corruption`].
