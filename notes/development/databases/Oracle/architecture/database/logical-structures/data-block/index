$ Oracle logical database structure: data block
@ data block

A *data block* is the smallest → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[locigal] unit of data storage and organization and
corresponds to a specific number of bytes on disk and the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA[SGA's]
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache/buffer[buffer] (in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache).

*Data blocks* are also referred to by 
  • (Oracle) blocks
  • pages

{ Recording changes to a data block

  Changes that are performed on a data block are recorded in *change vectors* (see → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data/record).

}
{ Block size

  The block size is operating system dependent and cannot be smaller than 2KB or larger than 32KB.

}
{ Database block address (DBA) #ora-db-block-addr

  The database block address (DBA) identifies the location of a block in the storage system. It consists of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data file] number and a block number.

  The (hashed) value of the DBA is also used to determine the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache#ora-buffer-cache-lru[buffer cache's LRU list] in which the
  block is referred (if the block *is* cached in the buffer cache).

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility[`dbms_utility`] provides the three functions `make_data_block_address`, `data_block_address_block` and
  `data_block_address_file` to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility/data-block-address-conversion[convert between data block address and file/block number].

}
{ Maximum number of columns in a data block

  Although → development/databases/Oracle can store → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns#oracle-max-table-columns[up to 1000 columns in a table or view] (as of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN), the maximum number
  of columns in a data block is limited to 255.

  → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/backup-recovery/backup/incremental

  The → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters#db_block_checksum[`db_block_checksum` init parameter]

 `ORA-01578` is the *block corruption error* and is recorded in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/alert-log.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/objects/clusters[Oracle cluster object] allows to store «related» records (for example with the same parent key) in the same database block.

  The PL/SQL package → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/rowid[`dbms_rowid`] provides the some functions such as `rowid_block_number`, `rowid_relative_fno` and `rowid_row_number` which allow
  to determine the block number and the record number within this block of a given record, which is identified by its → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/rowid.

  Using → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter/dump/datafile[`alter system dump datafile …`] to
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter/dump/datafile#ora-dump-block[dump a data block] to a
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files/Automatic-Diagnostic-Repository/trace-file which allows to inspect the data block's content.
