$ Oracle logical database structure: data block
@ data block

A *data block* is the smallest → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[locigal] unit of data storage and organization and
corresponds to a specific number of bytes on disk and the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA[SGA's]
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache/buffer[buffer] (in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache).

*Data blocks* are also referred to by 
  • (Oracle) blocks
  • pages

{ Recording changes to a data block

  Changes that are performed on a data block are recorded in *change vectors* (see → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data/record).

}
{ Maximum number of columns in a data block

  Although → development/databases/Oracle can store → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns#oracle-max-table-columns[up to 1000 columns in a table or view] (as of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN), the maximum number
  of columns in a data block is limited to 255.

}
{ Block size
