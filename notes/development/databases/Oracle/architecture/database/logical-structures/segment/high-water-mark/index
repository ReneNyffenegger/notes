$ Oracle: high water mark
@ high water mark

The *high water mark* divides a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment into the portion that contains or contained data and the portion that is still unused.

The used part might not contain data or only sparse data, because data was deleted again.

The *high water mark* is especially significant in *full table scan* because this operation only reads → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data blocks] only up to the
high water mark.
