$ Oracle: Temporary segment

*Temporary segments* are needed for operations involving
  • sorts
  • hashing
  • bitmap merging

Temporary segments are also used/created by the following SQL statements
  • `create table as select`
  • `alter index rebuild`
  • `create index`
  • `drop table` / `drop object` (which converts the segment into a temporary segment which is then cleaned up later(?) by SMON?)
  • `create snapshot`
  • `create partition table`


→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/SMON cleans temporary segments up:
   • in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary[temporary tablespaces] when the database is started up
   • in permanent tablespaces when the user process has died before it can clean up the segment.


sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary[Temporary tablespaces]
  -
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[Segments]

   The following command drops the temporary segments in the tablespace whose id/number is `n-1` (MOS Note 1495163.1):
code {
alter session set events 'immediate trace name → development/databases/Oracle/tools/oradebug/doc/event/action/drop_segments[drop_segments] level n`
code }
