$ Oracle logical database structure: Segment
@ segment

A segment is the logical container for
  • a *nonpartitioned schema objects*
  • a *partition* of partitioned objects
  • a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/clusters of tables

A segment belongs to exactly one → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace and consists of
of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[extents].

The data of a segment is stored in at least one → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data file], but can easily span multiple data files.
-
In the case of a *hybrid partitioned table* however, some data is stored via (ordinary) segments in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files] and other data is stored in external data sources.

In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary, storage allocation for segments is recorded in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/segments[`dba_segments`].

Types of segments:
 • User segments
 • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/undo[Undo segments]
 • Temporary segments

A segment in *manual segment space management* (MSSM) maintains a *free list* which keeps track of free blocks below a segment's
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/high-water-mark.

Some statistical numbers about segment usage is found in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/segment_statistics`.

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/header

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/space` returns space related information of segments and can be used to analyze segment growth and space requirements.
