$ Oracle: Temporary tablespace
@ temporary tablespace

A *temporary tablespace* stores objects only for the duration of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session such as
  • intermediary sort results
  • temporary tables and indexes
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob#ora-lob-3-types[temporary LOBs].
  • temporary B-trees

A single temporary tablespace named *TEMP* is created along with the creation of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database.
-
It's possible to add more temporary tablespaces.

It's not possible to create → development/databases/Oracle/objects[database objects] in a temporary tablespace (however, the column name `tablespace_name` in
`→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/private_temp_tables` seems to indicate that data stored in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/temporary/private[private temporary table]
may be stored in a temporary tablespace).
