$ Oracle: Temporary Tablespace
@ temporary tablespace

A *temporary → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace* stores objects only for the duration of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session such as
  • intermediary sort results
  • temporary tables and indexes (see → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/temporary[temporary segments])
  • → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob#ora-lob-3-types[temporary LOBs].
  • temporary B-trees

A single temporary tablespace named *TEMP* is created along with the creation of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database.

When adding more temporary tablespaces, Oracle recommends to create them → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-local-mgmt[locally managed] with *uniform extent sizes* of 1MB.

It's not possible to create → development/databases/Oracle/objects[database objects] in a temporary tablespace (however, the column name `tablespace_name` in
`→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/private_temp_tables` seems to indicate that data stored in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/temporary/private[private temporary table]
may be stored in a temporary tablespace).

{ Shrinking the tablespace

  Temporary tablespaces can be shrunk:
code {
alter tablespace temp shrink space;
alter tablespace temp shrink space                                       keep 500 m;
alter tablespace temp shrink tempfile '/opt/oracle/oradata/…/temp01.dbf' keep 500 m;
code }

}
{ Determine a database's default temporary tablespace #ora-temp-ts-def

code {
select property_value from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/database/properties where property_name = 'DEFAULT_TEMP_TABLESPACE';
code }

}
{ Tablespace groups

  A *tablespace group* allows to use multiple temporary tablespaces for operations that require large amounts of temporary space.
