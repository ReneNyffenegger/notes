$ Oracle logical database structure: Tablespace
@ tablespace

A tablespace consists of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files].

Because a tablespace is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[logical storage structure] and a data file a
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[phsysical structure] the tablespace/data file boundary is the connection between the logical and physical world of
→ development/databases/Oracle storage.

In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary, tablespaces are listed under → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tablespaces[`dba_tablespaces`].

A → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users can be assigned a *default tablespace*.
-
For each tablespace, a quote can be defined for a user (see also `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ts_quotas`)


There are three types of tablespaces:
  • permanent tablespaces,
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo[undo tablepspaces] and
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary[temporary tablespaces]

{ Typical tablespaces

  A database must have at least the two tablespaces
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSTEM and
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX

{ Space management (locally vs dictionary managed tablespaces) #ora-ts-space-management

  There are two methods to manage available space (that is its → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[extents]) within a tablespace:
    • Locally managed tablespaces, and
    • Dictionary managed tablespaces

  A *locally managed tablespaces* is the more modern and usually preferred variant.

  Which variant is used for a tablespace can be queried with the following select statement:
code {
select
   tablespace_name,
   extent_management
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tablespaces[dba_tablespaces];
code }

  { Space management for locally managed tablespace

    For a locally managed tablespace, there are again two different methods to manage space:
      • Automatic segment space management (ASSM), the default for locally managed tablespace
      • Manual segment space management (MSSM), which is considered legacy

    With ~automatic segment space management~, space in a tablespace is managed using bitmaps. There is only one parameter that controls space allocation:
      • `pctfree`

    With ~manual segment space management~, free space is managed using a linked list by the name of *free list*. This list records free
    → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data blocks] below a segment's *high water mark*.
    -
    Parameters that control space management are:
      • `pctfree`
      • `pctused`
      • `freelists`
      • `freelist groups`

    The space management type (for locally managed tablespace) can be queried in the column `segment_space_management` in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[`dba_tablespaces`].
