$ Oracle logical database structure: tablespace
@ tablespace

A tablespace consists of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files].

Because a tablespace is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[logical storage structure] and a data file a
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[phsysical structure] the tablespace/data file boundary is the connection between the logical and physical world of
→ development/databases/Oracle storage.

In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary, tablespaces are listed under → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tablespaces[`dba_tablespaces`].

{ Typical tablespaces

  A database must have at least the two tablespaces
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSTEM and
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX

  Typically, there is also an
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo[undo tablepsace] and a
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary

}
{ Locally / dictionary managed tablespace

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[extents] that are allocated in a tablespace can be managed either locally or in
  the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[dictionary].

  Managing them locally is the more modern and usually preferred variant.

  Which variant is used for a tablespace can be queried with the following select statement:
code {
selet
select
   tablespace_name,
   extent_management
from
   dba_tablespaces;
code }

}

 `dbms_space_admin` provides maintenance procedures for *locally managed* tablepsaces;
