$ Oracle logical database structure: tablespace
@ tablespace

A tablespace consists of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files].

Because a tablespace is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[logical storage structure] and a data file a
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[phsysical structure] the tablespace/data file bounderay is the connection between the logical and physical world of
→ development/databases/Oracle storage.

{ Typical tablespaces

  A database must have at least the two tablespaces
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSTEM and
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX

  Typically, there is also an
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo[undo tablepsace] and a
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary

}


sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX,
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo[undo tablespaces]

  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[Logical structures]
