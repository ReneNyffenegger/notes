$ Oracle logical database structure: Tablespace
@ tablespace

A tablespace consists of one or more → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files].

Because a tablespace is a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures[logical storage structure] and a data file a
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files[phsysical structure] the tablespace/data file boundary is the connection between the logical and physical world of
→ development/databases/Oracle storage.

In the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary, tablespaces are listed under → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tablespaces[`dba_tablespaces`], quotas
are recorded in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ts_quotas`.

A → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users can be assigned a *default tablespace*.
-
For each tablespace, a quote can be defined for a user (see also `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ts_quotas`)

There are three types of tablespaces:
  • permanent tablespaces,
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/undo[undo tablepspaces] and
  • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/temporary[temporary tablespaces]

{ Typical tablespaces

  A database must have at least the two tablespaces
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSTEM and
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/SYSAUX

}
{ Space management (locally vs dictionary managed tablespaces) #ora-ts-space-management

  There are two methods to manage available space (that is its → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/extent[extents]) within a tablespace:
    • Locally managed tablespaces (LMT) with either automatical (ASSM) or manual segment space management (MSSM), and
    • Dictionary managed tablespaces (DMT)

  A *locally managed tablespaces* is the more modern and usually preferred variant.
  -
  Oracle recommends LMTs with ASSM.

  Dictionary managed tablespaces can only be created if the SYSTEM tablespace is also dictionary managed (error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-12913_cannot-create-dictionary-managed-tablespace)

  Which variant is used for a tablespace can be queried with the following select statement:
code {
select
   tablespace_name,
   extent_management
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tablespaces[dba_tablespaces];
code }

  { Segment space management for locally managed tablespace

    For a locally managed tablespace, there are again two different methods to manage space:
      • Automatic segment space management (ASSM), the default for locally managed tablespace
      • Manual segment space management (MSSM), which is considered legacy

    { Automatic segment space management

      With *ASSM*, space in a tablespace is managed using bitmaps. There is only one parameter that controls space allocation:
        • `pctfree`

    }
    { Manual segment space management

      With *MSSM*, free space is managed using a linked list by the name of *free list*. This list records free
      → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data blocks] below a segment's *high water mark*.

      Parameters that control space management are:
        • `pctfree`
        • `pctused`
        • `freelists`
        • `freelist groups`

    }
    { Querying space management type from the data dictionary

      The space management type (for locally managed tablespace) can be queried in the column `segment_space_management` in `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace`.
      -
      But compare with the value of `segment_subtype` (which can be `ASSM`, `MSSM`, `SECUREFILE` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null`) in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/segments`.

    }

  }

}

 `dbms_space_admin` provides maintenance procedures for *locally managed* tablepsaces.
