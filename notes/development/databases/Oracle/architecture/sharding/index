$ Oracle Sharding

With *Oracle Sharding*, → development/Data[data] is horizontally distributed (partitioned) across multiple → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database[databases].

The application does not realize that the data is sharded and perceives it as coming from a single database: the sharded database (SDB).
-
The SDB is a *logical database*.
