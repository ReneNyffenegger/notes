  The → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL procedure → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter/kill-session/kill_my_session[`KILL_MY_SESSION`] can be used to
  terminate a session.
  -
  Alternatively, on → Windows, there is also the → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin/orakill[`orakill`] utility.

  The current session can also be terminated like so
code {
SQL> alter session set events 'immediate crash';
…
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-03113_end-of-file-on-communication-channel
…
SQL> select * from dual;
…
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-03114_not-connected-to-ORACLE
code }

    • the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter/cancel-sql` statement which terminates the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execution of an SQL statement]
    • the `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/max/idle/blocker_time` parameter which specifies how long a blocking session can remain idle until it gets terminated

  → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[System privileges] and → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles[roles] that are enabled in the current session can be queried frmo
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/session/roles` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/session/privs`.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session[SQL noun `session`].

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus command `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/connect` disconnects the current session and starts a new one.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] shows all sessions.
  -
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/wait[`v$session_wait`] shows what each session is waiting for.
  -
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/mystat[`v$mystat`] records statistical data about the session that accesses it.
  -
  Similarly, → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sesstat[`v$sesstat`] provides these statics for all current session.

  The functions `current_session_id` and `current_session_serial` in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/debug_jdwp[`dbms_debug_jdwp`] provide a session's id (SID) and serial#.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/pipe[`dbms_pipe`] allows two or more sessions to communicate with each other.

  Resources that are shared among sessions are protected by → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/latch[latches] from being corrupted.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sess/time_model[`v$sess_time_model`] reports accumulated times for various categories of waiting operations.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/system[`dbms_system`] allows to modify
