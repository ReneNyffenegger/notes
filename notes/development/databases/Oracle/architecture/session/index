 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter`.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL procedure → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter/kill-session/kill_my_session[`KILL_MY_SESSION`] can be used to
  terminate a session.

  Alternatively, on → Windows, there is also the → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin/orakill[`orakill`] utility.

  The current session can also be terminated like so
code {
SQL> alter session set events 'immediate crash'
…
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-03113_end-of-file-on-communication-channel
…
SQL> select * from dual;
…
