$ Oracle multitenant architecture
@ multitenant architecture

The multitenant architecture allows for a separation of duties between a PDB administrator and a CDB administrator.

Starting with → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c, Oracle supports multitenant architecture only.

{ Container Database CDB

? A *container database (CDB)* consists of
    • Zero, one or more *pluggable databases (PDB)* and
    • Zero, one or more *application containers*

  A CDB also has
    • Exactly one *CDB root container* (also referred to as the «root»)
    • Exactly one *system container*
    • Exactly one *seed PDB*

}
{ System container

  The system container is the CDB's *logical container* and contains
    • The root container
    • The CDB's PDBs.

}
{ Portable Database PDB

  A *portable database* (PDB) is a collection of
    • Schemas
    • Schema objects
    • Non-Schema objects

  A PDB belongs to zero or one application container.
  -
  If it  belongs to an application container, it is a *application PDB*.

  With regard to → development/databases/Oracle/Net, a PDB feels like an ordinary
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database.

}
{ Application container

  An *application container* is an optional component of the CDB which stores stores
  → development/Data and → development/Data/metadata for «application back-ends».

  An application container consists of
    • Exactly one *application root* and
    • the PDBs plugged into this root.

}
{ Root container

  The root container stores the → development/Data/metadata which is required to manage the PDBs.

  The name of the root container is `CDB$ROOT`.

  Oracle recommends to use *AL32UTF8* for the root → development/Unicode/character-set.

}
{ Seed PDB

  The *seed PDB* is a system-supplied, read-only template from which new PDBs are created.

  The name of the seed PDB is `PDB$SEED`.

code {
create pluggable database pdb_abc_2
from pdb_abc_1
file_name_convert=('/pdb_abc_1/', '/pdb_abc_2/');

    admin user pdb_xyz_admin identified by secretGarden;

 `dbms_pdb`

  The procedure `dbms_pdb_num` (`→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catfusrg_sql`) checks if Multitenant is used and counts user-created PDBs.

code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database where cdb = 'YES';
code }

code {
select
   sys_context('USERENV', 'CDB_NAME'),
   sys_context('USERENV', 'CON_NAME'), 
   sys_context('USERENV', 'APPLICATION_NAME')
from
   dual;
code }

code {
select * from containers(table_name);
select * from containers(table_name) where con_id <> sys_context('userenv', 'con_id');
code }

    DL = data link (formerly OBL); MDL = metadata link; EDL = extended data link

    Columns
      • `SHARING` in `DBA_OBJECTS`
