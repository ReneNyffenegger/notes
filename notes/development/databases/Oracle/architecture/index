$ Oracle architecture

{ Big Picture

  Oracle distinguishes between
    • → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instances] and
    • databases.

  { Database

    The database is the set of (physical) files that store the → development/Data[data] or
    are used for the operation.
    -
    The files that store data are called *data files*.
    -
    The files used for operation are called → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/system-files[system files].

  }
  { Instance

    An Oracle instance consists of memory and → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes].

    Thus, when an Oracle Database is shut down, there is no instance.

  }

}
{ Single instance and RAC databases

  { Single instance

    In a *single instance database*, the database is attached to at most one instance.

  }
  { Real Application Clusters

    On the other hand, in a → development/databases/Oracle/Options/real-application-clusters[Real Application Cluster] (RAC) environment, there are multiple instances that
    share the same database.

    These instances (usually) run on different (hardware) servers.

    For a client application, there is no difference between a RAC environment and a single instance: the cluster *feels* like a single server.

  }

}
{ Listener

  The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/Listener is needed for establishing connections between client applications and an Oracle server.

  When a client application wants to open an Oracle connection, it contacts the listener. The listener then creates a *user*
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[process] and hands the connection details to the client application.

}
