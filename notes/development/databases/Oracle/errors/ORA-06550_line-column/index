$ ORA-06550: line …, column …:

An *ORA-06550* error is thrown when attempting to execute an anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block] which is invalid.

The message indicates the line and column in the block where the invalidity originates.

Because ORA-06550 errors are related to PL/SQL, they're typically (always?) followed by a *PLS-xxxxx* error message.

{ Simple example

  The following block has a type which makes it impossible for Oracle to execute:
code {
declare
   txt varchar2(20);
begin
   txt := 'Hello world.';
   dmbs_output.put_line(txt);
-- ^^
-- ||  Note the typo!
end;
/
code }

Trying to execute the block results in the error message
code {
ERROR at line 5:
ORA-06550: line 5, column 4:
PLS-00201: identifier 'DMBS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE' must be declared
ORA-06550: line 5, column 4:
PL/SQL: Statement ignored
code }

  The identifier which is found at line 5, column 4, is the erroneus `dmbs_output`.

}


sa:

 Error message *ORA-04063: … has errors*.
