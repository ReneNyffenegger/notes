$ ORA-02290: check constraint … violated

The *ORA-02290* error message is thrown if the condition of a formulated → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/check is not met.


Create a table with a few check constraints:
code {
create table tq84_chk (
    col_1  varchar2(5)    check (col_1 = lower(col_1)),
    col_2  number  (5)    check (col_2 > 0           ),
    --
    check (length(col_1) < col_2)
);
code }
 
Insert a record which violates one of the constraints:
code {
insert into tq84_chk values ('foo', 2);
code }

The insert statement throws *ORA-02290: check constraint (RENE.SYS_C0038178) violated*.
-
Query `dba_constraints` to find out which constraint was violated:
code {
select
   owner,
   table_name,
   search_condition
from
   dba_constraints
where
   owner || '.' || constraint_name = 'RENE.SYS_C0038178';
code }
