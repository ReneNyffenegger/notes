$ ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended

{ Trailing semicolons

  Semicolons are typically used in SQL scripts to separate SQL statements from one another, but they don't technically belong to the SQL statement and cause the
 *ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended* error in the following example:
code {
create table tq84_test_tab(a number);

begin
--
-- Note the trailing semicolon in the insert statement:
--
   execute immediate '
      insert into tq84_test_tab values(42);
   ';
end;
/

drop table tq84_test_tab;
code }


  Sometimes, a trailing semicolon also raises the → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00922_missing-or-invalid-option error message.


}
{ Missing semicolon

  In → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL, the semicolon *is* important. Because it is missing in the following anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block, it raises the ORA-00933 error:
code {
declare
   cnt   number;
begin
   select
      count(*) into cnt
   from
      user_objects
     
   dbms_output.put_line('Number of objects is: ' || cnt);
end;
/
code }

}
{ GROUP BY

  This error might also be thrown if the alias of a
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns in a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` statement's select list is copied down to the
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` clause:

code {
select
   sum(bytes),
   owner          object_owner
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/segments[dba_segments]
group by
   owner          object_owner
;
code }

}
{ UNION ALL combined with GROUP BY #ora-00933-union-all-group-by

  An *ORA-00933* is also thrown when appling an `order by` clause to the first query of a statement that combines two queries with `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all`:
code {
begin
   insert into tq84_ora_933(gr, val) values ('A', 1000);
   insert into tq84_ora_933(gr, val) values ('B',  500);
   insert into tq84_ora_933(gr, val) values ('C', 1500);
   commit;
end;
/
 
select  gr    , val      from tq84_ora_933 order by val desc union all
select 'TOTAL', sum(val) from tq84_ora_933;

drop table tq84_ora_933;
code }

  If the `order by` clause is applied at the end of the statement, Oracle throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00904_invalid-identifier#ora-00904-union-all-order-by[ORA-00904: invalid identifier].

}

sa:

  This error is also thrown when attempting to return the value of an
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/identity[identity column] with the
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/identity/returning-into#ora-returning-identity-into[`insert … returning into`] clause.
