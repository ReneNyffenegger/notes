$ ORA-12054: cannot set the ON COMMIT refresh attribute for the materialized view

{ ANSI join vs traditional joins #ora-12054-ansi-join

  Create two tables that will later be joined in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views/materialized:
code {
create table tq84_A (
   id  varchar2( 5) primary key,
   txt varchar2(10)
);

create table tq84_B (
   id    references tq84_A,
   val_1 number,
   val_2 number
)
code }

  The following materialized view joins these two tables with an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join/ANSI. The materialized view is created without any error:
code {
create materialized view tq84_MV
   refresh complete on commit
as  
select
   a.id,
   sum(b.val_1) sum_val_1
from
   tq84_A a                 join
   tq84_B b on a.id = b.id
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by
   a.id;
code }

  Trying to create the following materialized view with a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery throws an *ORA-12054: cannot set the ON COMMIT refresh attribute for the materialized view* error:
code {
create materialized view tq84_MV_subquery
   refresh complete on commit
as  
select
   id,
   sum_val_1
from (
   select
      a.id,
      sum(b.val_1) sum_val_1
   from
      tq84_A a                 join
      tq84_B b  on a.id = b.id
   group by
      a.id
);
code }

  It turns out that this error is not thrown anymore if the subquery joins these tables with a «traditional» join:
code {
create materialized view tq84_MV_subquery
   refresh complete on commit
as  
select
   id,
   sum_val_1
from (
select
   a.id,
   sum(b.val_1) sum_val_1
from
   tq84_A a,
   tq84_B b
where
   a.id = b.id
group by
   a.id
);
code }

  Testing the materialized view:
code{
insert into tq84_A values ('A', 'aaa' );
insert into tq84_A values ('B', 'bbbb');
insert into tq84_B values ('A', 5, 1);
insert into tq84_B values ('A', 6, 2);

→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit;

select * from tq84_MV;
select * from tq84_MV_subquery
code }


  Cleaning up:
code {
drop materialized view tq84_MV_subquery;
drop materialized view tq84_MV;
drop table tq84_B;
drop table tq84_A;
code }

}
