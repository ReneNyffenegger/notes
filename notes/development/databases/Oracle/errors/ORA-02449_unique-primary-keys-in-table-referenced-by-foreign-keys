$ ORA-02449: unique/primary keys in table referenced by foreign keys

The error message *ORA-02449: unique/primary keys in table referenced by foreign keys* is caused by the
`drop table` statement if the table that is attempted to be dropped is referenced by one or more tables
with → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys] that reference the to-be-dropped table's
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key.

{ Remove foreign keys

  The following script is quite a brute force attempt to remove all foreign keys which reference
  a table so that the table can be dropped.
  
  If this script *should* be used, of course, is in the eye of the beholder.
