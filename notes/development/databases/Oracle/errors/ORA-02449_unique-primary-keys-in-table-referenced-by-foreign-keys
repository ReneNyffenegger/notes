$ ORA-02449: unique/primary keys in table referenced by foreign keys

The error message *ORA-02449: unique/primary keys in table referenced by foreign keys* is caused by the
`drop table` statement if the table that is attempted to be dropped is referenced by one or more tables
with → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys] that reference the to-be-dropped table's
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key.

{ DROP TABLE … CASCADE CONSTRAINTS

code {
create table tq84_A (
   id number primary key
);

create table tq84_B (
   id   number primary key,
   id_a        references TQ84_A
);

alter table tq84_A add id_b references tq84_B;

--
--   The following statements both cause ORA-02449: unique/primary keys in table referenced by foreign keys
--
drop table tq84_A;
drop table tq84_B;

--
--   Tables can be dropped with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/drop/cascade-constraints[DROP TABLE … CASCADE CONSTRAINTS]:
--
drop table tq84_A cascade constraints;
drop table tq84_B cascade constraints;
code }

{ Remove foreign keys (Brute force)

  The following script is quite a brute force attempt to remove all foreign keys which reference
  a table so that the table can be dropped.
  
  If this script *should* be used, of course, is in the eye of the beholder.

  Compare the effect of this script with `alter table disable primary key cascade`.
