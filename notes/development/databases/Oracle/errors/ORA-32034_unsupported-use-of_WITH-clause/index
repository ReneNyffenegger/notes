$ ORA-32034: unsupported use of WITH clause

{ Nested WITH clauses

  Nested → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[`with` clauses] are not supported. The following statement tries to nest such clauses nevertheless which results in
 *ORA-32034: unsupported use of WITH clause*:
code {
with
    a as (select 4   n from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual),
    b as (with c as (select n+3 n from a)
select
   * from b;
code }

}
{ Using the WITH_PLSQL hint #ora-32034-with_plsql

  When using → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with#ora-with-func[local functions in a `with` clause], the `with_plsql` clause needs to be used to prevent
 *ORA-32034: unsupported use of WITH clause*.

  We need a demonstration table:
code {
create table tq84_t (n number);
code }


  The following statement causes *ORA-32034: unsupported use of WITH clause*:
code {
insert into tq84_t
   with function f(i number) return number as begin
        return i*2;
   end f;
select
   f(level)
from
   dual → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/_examples/generate-rows#ora-gen-data-connect-by[connect by level] <= 10;
/
code }


  The following statement uses the `with_plsql` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints to prevent this error:
code {
insert /*+ with_plsql */ into tq84_t
   with function f(i number) return number as begin
        return i*2;
   end f;
select
   f(level)
from
   dual connect by level <= 10;
/
code }

  Testing the result and cleaninug up:
code {
select * from tq84_t;

drop table tq84_t;
code }

}
