$ ORA-00979: not a GROUP BY expression

A `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` with a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` clause requires all non-aggregated columns to be present in the `group by` clause also, otherwise, Oracle throws
a *ORA-00979: not a GROUP BY expression* error message, as demonstrated below:
code {
create table tq84_00979 (
    val    number,
    grp_1  varchar2(10),
    grp_2  varchar2(10),
    col    date
);

--
-- Cause ORA-00979:
--
select
   max(val),
   grp_1,
   grp_2
from
   tq84_00979
group by
   grp_1;

--
-- This one is OK
--
select
   max(val),
   grp_1,
   grp_2
from
   tq84_00979
group by
   grp_1,
   grp_2;


--
-- This one also causes an ORA-00979 because
-- of the col expression in the order by clause
--
select
   max(val),
   grp_1,
   grp_2
from
   tq84_00979
group by
   grp_1,
   grp_2
order by
   col;

drop table tq84_00979;
code }

{ Improved error messages in 23c

  The ORA-00979 error message belongs to the → development/databases/Oracle/errors[error messages] that were
  → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c#ora-23c-err[improved in the 23c release]: in this release, it now lists the (first?) expression missing in the `group by` clause.
