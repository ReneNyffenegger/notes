$ ORA-00936: missing expression

{ Using a column name that is a semi-reserved keyword

  Semi-reserved keywords can be used as column names when tables or views are created. However, when using such column names in a query's select list,
  the query throws a *ORA-00936: missing expression* error, as for example with the following query:
code {
select
   group#,
   thread#,
   sequence#,
   iscurrent,
   current,
   first_change#,
   con_id
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/archive;
code }

  In order to query a semi-reserved keyword, they need to be quoted (`"…"`):
code {
select
   group#,
   thread#,
   sequence#,
   iscurrent,
  "CURRENT",
   first_change#,
   con_id
from
   v$archive;
code }

  Semi-reserved keywords can be found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/reserved_words[`v$reserved_words`]:
code {
select
   keyword
from
   v$reserved_words
where
   res_semi = 'Y'
code }

}
