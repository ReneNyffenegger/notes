$ ORA-00936: missing expression

The following → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement causes the error message *ORA-00936: missing expression* to be thrown:
code {
select
   object_name,
   object_type,
   owner      , -- <== Note the comma!
from
   dba_objects;
code }


{ Using a column name that is a semi-reserved keyword

  Semi-reserved keywords can be used as column names when tables or views are created. However, when using such column names in a query's select list,
  the query throws a *ORA-00936: missing expression* error, as for example with the following query:
code {
select
   group#,
   thread#,
   sequence#,
   iscurrent,
   current,
   first_change#,
   con_id
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/archive;
code }

  In order to query a semi-reserved keyword, they need to be quoted (`"…"`):
code {
select
   group#,
   thread#,
   sequence#,
   iscurrent,
  "CURRENT",
   first_change#,
   con_id
from
   v$archive;
code }

  Semi-reserved keywords can be found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/reserved_words[`v$reserved_words`]:
code {
select
   keyword
from
   v$reserved_words
where
   res_semi = 'Y'
code }

}
{ Using CHAR instead of CHR

  This error message is also caused when inadvertantly using the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/char[data type `char`] instead of
  the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/text/chr-nchr[SQL function `chr`]:
code {
select
   dummy || char(13) as char_with_newline
from
   dual;
code }

}
