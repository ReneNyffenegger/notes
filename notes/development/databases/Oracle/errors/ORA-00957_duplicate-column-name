$ ORA-00957: duplicate column name

{ CREATE TABLE statement

  A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[table column] name must uniquely identify a column and must therefore not be used multiple times.

  The following `create table` statement failes because `col_two` is specified twice:
code {
create table tq84_ora_00957 (
   col_one   number  (1),
   col_two   varchar2(2),
   col_two   varchar2(2),  -- col_two appears twice
   col_three date
);
code }

}
{ INSERT statement

  Similarly, in an `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert` statement, a column name must also be unique.
code {
create table tq84_ora_00957 (
   col_one   number  (1),
   col_two   varchar2(2),  -- col_two appears twice
   col_three date
);

insert into tq84_ora_00957 (
   col_one,
   col_two,
   col_two,
   col_three
)
values (
   1,
  'X',
  'X',
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate
);
code }

}
{ SELECT statement

  It is permissible to select the same column (name) twice in a `development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select`:
code {
select
   col_one,
   col_two,
   col_two,
   col_three
from
   tq84_ora_00957;
code }

  In this case, Oracle quietly aliases the second `col_two` to `col_two_1`.

}
{ Views

  Although the `select` statement above can be executed, it cannot be used in a view.

  The following statement also throws a *ORA-00957: duplicate column name* error:

code {
create view tq84_ora_00957_v as
select
   col_one,
   col_two,
   col_two,
   col_three
from
   tq84_ora_00957;
code }

}
{ MODEL clause #ora-00957-model

  The *ORA-00957* error can also be thrown in the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model` clause:
code {
select
   *
from
   dual
model
   dimension by (dummy)
   measures     (dummy)
   ()
;
code }

}
