$ ORA-00960: ambiguous column naming in select list

An *ORA-00960:ambiguous column naming in select list* error is caused, for example, with the following
`→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` statement because the identifier `object_name` in the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by` clause does technically (but not value-wise) identify a column:
code {
select
   object_type,
   object_name,
   obj.*
from
   user_objects obj
order by
   object_name;
code }

In order to fix this error, at least the identifier `object_name` of the `order by` clause must be qualified with the alias:
code {
select
   object_type,
   object_name,
   obj.*
from
   user_objects obj
order by
   obj.object_name;
code }
