$ ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object

The → development/databases/Oracle/objects#ora-obj-name[name] of an → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] must be unique within a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/_namespace[namespace]. The *ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object* error indicates that there is already another object in the same name namespace with
the given name.

Ok (usually):
code {
create table xyz;
code }

After creating an object with the name `XYZ`, the following statements (as well as others) would throw *ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object*:
code {
create table xyz;
create view  xyz as select 1 one from dual;
code }
