$ ORA-02291: integrity constraint … violated - parent key not found

The *ORA-02291: integrity constraint … violated - parent key not found* error message is thrown if the value of a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key that was attempted to be inserted into a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables was not found in the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary key].

{ Demonstration

  The following simple demonstration will throw this error.

  First, we need two tables with a foreign-primary key relationship:
code {
create table tq84_P (
   id  number(6),
   val varchar2(10),
   --
   constraint pk primary key (id)
);

create table tq84_F (
    id_p,
    txt    varchar2(20),
    --
    constraint fk foreign key (id_p) references tq84_P
);
code }


  The following statement throws *ORA-02291: integrity constraint (RENE.FK) violated - parent key not found*:
code {
insert into tq84_F values (1, 'xyz');
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_F;
drop table tq84_P;
code }

}
{ Determining parent and child table #ora-02291-det-tab

  The following statement helps to find the involved tables given the constraint name in the error message:
code {
select
   pk.owner         pk_owner,
   pk.table_name    pk_table,
   fk.owner         fk_owner,
   fk.table_name    fk_table, 
   pk.status        pk_status,
   fk.status        fk_status
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints[all_constraints]  pk                                                     join
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints[all_constraints]  fk on pk.owner           = fk.r_owner            and
                          pk.constraint_name = fk.r_constraint_name
where
   fk.owner || '.' || fk.constraint_name = 'RENE.FK';
code }
