$ ORA-02273: this unique/primary key is referenced by some foreign keys

A → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key cannot be dropped as long as → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys] reference it. An attempt to do so results in
the error message *ORA-02273: this unique/primary key is referenced by some foreign keys*.

This is demonstrated with the following simple snippets.

Create two tables with a primary key-foreign key relation:
code {
create table tq84_P (
    id  integer,
    txt varchar2(10) not null,
    constraint tq84_P_pk primary key (id)
);

create table tq84_C (
    id_p   not null,
    val    number(5,2),
    constraint tq84_C_fk foreign key (id_p) references tq84_P
);
code }


The following statement throws *ORA-02273: this unique/primary key is referenced by some foreign keys*:
code {
alter table tq84_P drop constraint tq84_P_pk;
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_C;
drop table tq84_P;
code }
