$ ORA-32630: multiple assignment in automatic order MODEL

In the following example, the error message *ORA-32630: multiple assignment in automatic order MODEL* is thrown because the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model` clause of
the `select` statement uses `automatic order` in the `rules` clause and multple rules apply
to the same row (so that Oracle cannot determine the order in which the rules should be applied):
code {
create table tq83_model_cell_assignment (
    dim_1     number(2),
    dim_2     char(1),
    val_1     number(5,2),
    val_2     varchar2(3)
);

exec dbms_random.seed(42);
insert into tq84_model_cell_assignment
select
   level,
   chr(ascii('A')+10 - level),
   dbms_random.value(1,1000),
   dbms_random.string('a', 3)
from
   dual connect by level <= 10;

select *
from
   tq84_model_cell_assignment
model
   dimension by (dim_1, dim_2)
   measures     (val_1, val_2)
 rules
   automatic order
  (
    val_1[any      , dim_2 <= 'F'] = 999.99,
    val_1[dim_1 > 7, any         ] =   0.01
  );
code }

When `automatic order` is removed, the error disappears:
code {
select *
from
   tq84_model_cell_assignment
model
   dimension by (dim_1, dim_2)
   measures     (val_1, val_2)
  (
    val_1[any      , dim_2 <= 'F'] = 999.99,
    val_1[dim_1 > 7, any         ] =   0.01
  );
code }
