$ ORA-24344: success with compilation errors

*ORA-24344: success with compilation errors* indicates that the executed SQL statement is *syntactically* correct, but *logically* incorrect, for example because it references
a table that does not exist etc.

This error is for example thrown when creating a view with the *force* option on a table that is inexistant, as is demonstrated in
the following anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block]:
code {
begin
 
   → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate '
     create or replace force view TQ84_ORA_24344 as
     select
        xyz
     from
        inexisting_table';
       
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[dbms_output].put_line('View created without exception');

exception when others then
   dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm);
end;
/
code }
