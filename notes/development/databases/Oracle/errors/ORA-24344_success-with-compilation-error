$ ORA-24344: success with compilation errors

*ORA-24344: success with compilation errors* occurs when using `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate` to execute statments such as
`create or replace view`, `create procedure`, `alter procedure` etc. and the → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] that is being modified or created
(i.e.  the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[view], procedure etc.) have an error, for example because they reference a table that does not exist etc.

{ CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW

This error is for example thrown when creating a view with the *force* option on a table that is inexistant, as is demonstrated in
the following anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block]:
code {
begin
 
   → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate '
     create or replace force view TQ84_ORA_24344 as
     select
        xyz
     from
        inexisting_table';
       
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[dbms_output].put_line('View created without exception');

exception when others then
   dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm);
end;
/
code }

}
{ CREATE PROCEDURE

  The procedure which the `execute immediate` statement tries to create is syntactially incorrect: it lacks a semicolon after a statement:
code {
begin
   execute immediate q'[
create procedure tq84_ora_24344_prc as
   dbms_output.put_line('hello world')  -- Note the missing semicolon!
end tq84_ora_24344_prc;
]';
end;
/

ERROR:
ORA-24344: success with compilation error
ORA-06512: at line 2
code }
