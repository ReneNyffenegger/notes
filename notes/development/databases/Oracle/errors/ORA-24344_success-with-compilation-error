$ ORA-24344: success with compilation errors

*ORA-24344: success with compilation errors* occurs when using `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate` to execute statements such as
`create or replace view`, `create procedure`, `alter procedure` etc. and the → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] that is being modified or created
(i.e.  the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[view], procedure etc.) have an error, for example because they reference a table that does not exist etc.

In → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c, the error message text → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c#ora-23c-err[has changed to] *A compilation error occurred while creating an object*.

{ CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW

This error is for example thrown when creating a view with the *force* option on a table that is inexistant, as is demonstrated in
the following anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block]:
code {
begin
 
   → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate '
     create or replace force view TQ84_ORA_24344 as
     select
        xyz
     from
        inexisting_table';
       
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[dbms_output].put_line('View created without exception');

exception when others then
   dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm);
end;
/
code }

}
{ CREATE PROCEDURE

  The procedure which the `execute immediate` statement tries to create is syntactially incorrect: it lacks a semicolon after a statement:
code {
begin
   execute immediate q'[
create procedure tq84_ora_24344_prc as
   dbms_output.put_line('hello world')  -- Note the missing semicolon!
end tq84_ora_24344_prc;
]';
end;
/

ERROR:
ORA-24344: success with compilation error
ORA-06512: at line 2
code }

}
{ Interesting behavior in combination with EXECUTE IMMEDATE in 19c #ora-24344-exec-imm

  Tomáš Š. has notified me of an interesting behavior if an ORA-24344 error is thrown in a `create or replace view force` statement being executed in `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate` in an Oracle 19c (tested with oracle 19.21) database.

  The following → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block[PL/SQL block] creates the view `tq84_view_1` and then stops executing. The interesting thing is that Oracle reports *PL/SQL procedure successfully completed*:
code {
begin
 
    dbms_output.put_line('-- start --');
    execute immediate 'create or replace force view tq84_view_1 as select * from inexisting_table';

    dbms_output.put_line('-- not reached --');
    execute immediate 'create or replace force view tq84_view_2 as select * from inexisting_table';
 
end;
/
-- start --
code }

    The following query confirms that only the first view is created (with status being invalid):
code {
select
   object_name,
   status,
   created,
   last_ddl_time,
   timestamp
from
   user_objects
where
   object_name like 'TQ84_VIEW_%';
code }

   If the `execute immediate` statements are placed within → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler[exception handlers], it shows that there is indeed the ORA-24344 exception thrown and handled such that both
   views are created:
code {
drop view tq84_view_1;
begin
 
    dbms_output.put_line('-- start --');
    begin
    execute immediate 'create or replace force view tq84_view_1 as select * from inexisting_table';
    exception when others then dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm); end;
   
    dbms_output.put_line('-- reached --');
    begin
    execute immediate 'create or replace force view tq84_view_2 as select * from inexisting_table';
    exception when others then dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm); end;
   
    dbms_output.put_line('-- reached as well --');
 
end;
/
code }

}
