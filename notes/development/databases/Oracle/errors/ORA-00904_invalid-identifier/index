$ ORA-00904: invalid identifier

*ORA-00940: invalid identifier* typically indicates that the SQL parser recognized a token as an identifier but the identifier referred to nothing.
-
For exampile, `dual` has no column named `no_such_column`, therefore, the following SQL statement throws this error:
code {
select
   dummy,
   no_such_column
from
   dual;
code }

This error is often seen when a user thinks a function exists which in reality does not. For example, a developer coming from
→ development/databases/SQL-Server might think Oracle has a function named → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions#t-sql-isNull[`isNull`] and hit such an error:
code {
select
   isnull(dummy, 'Y') dummy_
   from
     dual;
code }


The error message *ORA-00904: invalid identifier* might also be caused in a `create table` statement if where a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns name was expected but none was given:
code {
create table tq84_invalid_identifier (
   id    number(9)    primary key,
   val   varchar2(10)            ,  -- <== Note the comma
);
code }
