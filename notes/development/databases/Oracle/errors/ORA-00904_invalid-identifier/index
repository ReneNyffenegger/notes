$ ORA-00904: invalid identifier

*ORA-00940: invalid identifier* typically indicates that the SQL parser recognized a token as an identifier but the identifier referred to nothing.
-
For exampile, `dual` has no column named `no_such_column`, therefore, the following SQL statement throws this error:
code {
select
   dummy,
   no_such_column
from
   dual;
code }

This error is often seen when a user thinks a function exists which in reality does not. For example, a developer coming from
→ development/databases/SQL-Server might think Oracle has a function named → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions#t-sql-isNull[`isNull`] and hit such an error:
code {
select
   isnull(dummy, 'Y') dummy_
   from
     dual;
code }


The error message *ORA-00904: invalid identifier* might also be caused in a `create table` statement if a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns name was expected but none was given:
code {
create table tq84_invalid_identifier (
   id    number(9)    primary key,
   val   varchar2(10)            ,  -- <== Note the comma
);
code }

{ UNION ALL in combination with ORDER BY #ora-00904-union-all-order-by

  Interestingly, an *ORA-00904* is also thrown in the following statement (even though `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual` has a column named `dummy`):
code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/order-by dummy;
code }

  If the `order by` clause is applied to the first query, Oracle throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/00933_SQL-command-not-properly-ended#ora-00933-union-all-group-by[ORA-00933: SQL command not preperly ended].

}

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00936_missing-expression,
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00942_table-or-view-does-not-exist.

  Surprisingly (at least to me), an ORA-00904 error is also thrown if the second parameter of the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/standard_hash` function is passed a value with lowercase letters.
