  If a column has a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns/default[defaul clause] which refers a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences that the schema in which the table is created does not
  have rights, the error message is also an ORA-00942:
code {
create table tq84_ora_942 (
   id   integer default other_schema.sequence_name.nextval,
   txt  varchar2(10)
);
code }

  Of course, this is also the case if the sequence is selected like so:
code {
select other_schema.sequence_name.nextval from dual;
code }
