$ ORA-00905: missing keyword

In the following SQL statement, the parser expects the keyword `end` after `'n/a'` but does not encounter it, so
in Oracle releases prior to → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c, the error message *ORA-00905: missing keyword* is thrown.
code {
select
   case when owner in ('SYS', 'SYSTEM') then 'n/a'
from
   dba_tables;
code }

In 23c or later, Oracle specifed the expected keyword, for example → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-02000_missing_keyword[ORA-02000: missing END keyword].

{ INTO clause / Copy paste from PL/SQL

  The ORA-00905 error is thrown, for example, when copying an `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select` statement from → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL without removing the `into` clause:
code {
select
   col_1
into
   var_1
from
   tab_A;
code }

}
{ Misc

code {
select
    *
from
   dual
pivot(max(dummy));
code }

}
