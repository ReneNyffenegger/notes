$ ORA-17008: Closed connection

As per MOS note 2873922.1, the ORA-17008 error typically happens in conjunction with *failover activity against a RAC database*, especially on a RAC node is brought down from a JAVA application configured to use failover (FCF/Fast Connection Failover).

I was experiencing this error when travelling in a train, using a Hot-Spot connection with SQL Developer (likely as a result of the Hot-Spot loosing its connection to the telcom provider).

Hm‥
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/serveroutput on
begin
   dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm(-17008));
end;
/
ORA-17008: Message 17008 not found;  product=RDBMS; facility=ORA
code }
