$ ORA-06553: PLS-:

*ORA-06553* is followed by a PL/SQL error, such as for example
  • PLS-221: '…' is not a procedure or is undefined
  • PLS-801: internal error [pfrxca: Entry vector too short - 5 < 5]

{ Example

  By default, there is no → development/databases/Oracle/objects[object] named `text`, the following
  select statement throws:→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00904_invalid-identifier[ORA-00904: "TEXT": invalid identifier]

code {
select
   text
from
   dual;
code }

  Create a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL package named `text`:
code {
create package text as
   function greeting return varchar2;
end;
/

create package body text as
   function greeting return varchar2 as begin
       return 'Hello World!';
   end greeting;
end;
/
code }

  `text` is a package, not a procedure. Oracle throws *ORA-06553: PLS-221: 'TEXT' is not a procedure or is undefined*:
code {
select
   text
from
   dual;
code }

   The following statement runs:
code {
select
   text.greeting
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

  Cleaning up:
code {
drop package text;
code }

}
