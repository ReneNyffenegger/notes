  The error codes 10000 through 10999 are reserved for *debug event codes* (and are not really errors,
  see → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[list of possible values for the `event` parameter]).

  The error codes 20000 through 20999 are reserved for *user defined errors* and can be raised with
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/exception/raise_application_error`.

  Sometimes, user defined error codes are also used by Oracle's → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms[`DBMS_*` packages], such as
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[`dbms_output`] (for example to throw *ORU-10027: buffer overflow, limit of … bytes*.
