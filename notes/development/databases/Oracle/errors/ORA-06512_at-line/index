$ ORA-06512: at <PL/SQL object>, line N

An *ORA-06512* error message is thrown by the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL execution engine if it encountes an SQL error or when `raise_application_error` is called and when no
→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler handles the error or exception.
-
The error message contains the actual error followed by a series of lines, starting with `ORA_06512`, that contain the stack trace.

{ Find offending source code line in exception handler #ora-06512-find-offending-line

  The following code is an attempt to demonstrate how it can be dealt with with ORA-06512 errors.

  { PL/SQL Package

    First, we need a PL/SQL package. For demonstration purposes, it is rather simple and does nothing useful. In fact, it only
    raises an exception in `proc_3`:

    The package's specification …
    gh|oracle-patterns|/errors/ORA/06512_at-line/show-offending-line/spec.sql||

    … and its body: 
    gh|oracle-patterns|/errors/ORA/06512_at-line/show-offending-line/body.sql||

  }
  { Using the package without exception handler

    The following anonymous block executes the package without exception handler. The returned error message conists of multiple lines, of which the lines starting with `ORA-06512` walk the stack from the line of code where
    the exception was raised to the caller:
    gh|oracle-patterns|/errors/ORA/06512_at-line/show-offending-line/exec-01.sql||

  }
  { Using the package with exception handler

    Within an exception handler, the value of → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[`sqlerrm`] is simply the raised error text. There is no stack trace:
    gh|oracle-patterns|/errors/ORA/06512_at-line/show-offending-line/sqlerrm.sql||

  }
  { Using DBMS_UTIILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_BACKTRACE

    However, it's possible to use → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/utility/format[`dbms_utility.format_error_backtrace`] to print (or analyze) the stacktrace in the exception handler:
    gh|oracle-patterns|/errors/ORA/06512_at-line/show-offending-line/error-backtrace.sql||

  }
  { Parse error stack using DBA_SOURCE

    Parse the error stack and use → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/source[`dba_source`] to display
    the source code line that cause the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/exception:
    gh|oracle-patterns|/errors/ORA/06512_at-line/show-offending-line/show-code-line.sql||

  }
