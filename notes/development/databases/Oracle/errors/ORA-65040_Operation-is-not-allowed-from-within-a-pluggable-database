$ ORA-65040: Operation is not allowed from within a pluggable database

Find an → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter] that can be immediately modified but is modifiable for a PDB:
code {
select
   name,
   value
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter
where
   ispdb_modifiable = 'FALSE'      and
   issys_modifiable = 'IMMEDIATE'
order by
   name;
code }

One of these parameters is `background_core_dump`. Assuming we're on a PDB, the following statement throws *ORA-65040: Operation is not allowed from within a pluggable database*:
code {
alter system set background_core_dump = full;
code }
