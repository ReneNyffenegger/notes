$ ORA-02292: integrity constraint (…) violated - child record found

Trying to delete a record in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables with a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key whose value is still referenced
in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables with a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key causes Oracle to throw the *ORA-02292* error.

{ Demonstration

code {
create table tq84_P (
   id  number(6),
   val varchar2(10),
   --
   constraint pk primary key (id)
);

create table tq84_F (
    id_p,
    txt    varchar2(20),
    --
    constraint fk foreign key (id_p) references tq84_P
);

insert into tq84_P values (1, 'one');
insert into tq84_F values (1, 'xyz');
code }

  Following statement throws *ORA-02292: integrity constraint (RENE.FK) violated - child record found* because `TQ84_F` has a record where `id_p = 1`:
code {
delete from tq84_P where id = 1;
code }

  The following statement can be used to find the name and owner of the table with the primary key:
code {
select
   pk.owner          pk_owner,
   pk.table_name     pk_table_name
from
   dba_constraints fk join
   dba_constraints pk on pk.owner            = fk.r_owner and
                         pk.constraint_name  = fk.r_constraint_name
where
   fk.owner           = 'RENE' and
   fk.constraint_name = 'FK'
;   
code }

  Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_F;
drop table tq84_P;
code }

}
