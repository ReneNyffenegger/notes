$ ORA-00911: invalid character

Althoug the dollar sign, the underscore and numbers are permitted in identifiers, identifiers cannot start with these characters (except when quoted):
code {
select _leading_underscore from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

String literals need to be quoted:
code {
create table tq84_xyz(
  col varchar2(20)
);

insert into tq84_xyz values (#)';

drop table tq84_xyz;
code }

sa:
  An SQL statement whose text contains the → development/Unicode character → https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+00A0[`\U00A0` = No-Break Space (NBSP)] causes an
  ORA-00911 error when used in a → Microsoft/dot-net application that used → development/databases/Oracle/ODP_NET (demonstration is
  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00911_invalid-character/dot-net[here]).
