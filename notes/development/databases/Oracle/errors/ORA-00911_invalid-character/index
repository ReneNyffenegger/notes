$ ORA-00911: invalid character

Although the dollar sign, the underscore and numbers are permitted in identifiers, identifiers cannot start with these characters (except when quoted):
code {
select _leading_underscore from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

String literals need to be quoted:
code {
create table tq84_xyz(
  col varchar2(20)
);

insert into tq84_xyz values (#);

drop table tq84_xyz;
code }

Special characters such as the greek μ which is commonly used to denote micro (as in microseconds) is not allowed in identifiers:
code {
create table tq84_t (
   time_µsecs  number
);
code }

If the μ *needs* to be in the column name, it can be quoted:
code {
create table tq84_t (
  "time_µsecs" number
);
code }

sa:

  This error message is also thrown when trying to set a hidden init-parameter without quoting it.
