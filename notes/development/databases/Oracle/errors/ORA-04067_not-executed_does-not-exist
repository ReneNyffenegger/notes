$ ORA-04067: … not executed, … does not exist

Create a package without package body:
code {
create or replace package tq84_ora_04067_pkg
   authid definer
as
   function f return number;
end tq84_ora_04067_pkg;
/
code }
 
Create a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views that uses the function in the package. The view compiles because the function `tq84_ora_04067_view.f` *is*
declared *even though* the package body does not exist:
code {
create or replace view tq84_ora_04067_view as
select
   tq84_ora_04067_pkg.f
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }
  
However, when the view is used, it will report the missing package body:
code {
select * from tq84_ora_04067_view;
-- ORA-04067: not executed, package body "RENE.TQ84_ORA_0406._PKG" does not exist
-- → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-06508_PL-SQL_could-not-find-program-unit-being-called[ORA-06508: PL/SQL: could not find program unit being called: "RENE.TQ84_ORA_04067_PKG"]
-- → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-06512_at-line[ORA-06512: at line 1]
code }
