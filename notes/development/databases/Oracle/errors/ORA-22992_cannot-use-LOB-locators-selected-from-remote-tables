$ ORA-22992: cannot use LOB locators selected from remote tables

rem {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[BLOBs and CLOBs] cannot be selected over a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/link in a
view.
-
Also, the same error is thrown in `create table … as` statement when the data selected contains a clob/blob over a database link.
rem }

{ ROW_NUMBER() analytic function

  For a reason I don't understand, the following statement threw an ORA-22992 error (Oracle 19.16).
  
 `tab_B@db.link` has a column that is a `clob` but I didn't select this column.

code {
select
   row_number() over (order by 1)
from
   tab_A@db.link a                 join
   tab_B@db.link b on a.id = b.id
;
code }


}
