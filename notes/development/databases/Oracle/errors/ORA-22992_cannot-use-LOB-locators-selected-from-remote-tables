$ ORA-22992: cannot use LOB locators selected from remote tables

  For a reason I don't understand, the following scenario threw an ORA-22992 error (Oracle 19.03 and 19.16).

  On the remote → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database, two tables are created:
code {
create table tq84_A (
   id  number  ( 5) not null,
   txt varchar2(10)
);

create table tq84_B (
   id  number  ( 5) not null,
   clb clob
);
code }

  Then, on the local database, I try to create table like so (19.3 and 19.16):
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/create/as-select[create table tq84_C as]
select
   row_number() over (order by 1) r
from
   tq84_A@dblink a                 join
   tq84_B@dblink b on a.id = b.id
;
code }

  This throws a *ORA-22992* although the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`clob`] of `tq84_B` is not involved.

  The table can be created if I don't use the analytic function:
code {
create table tq84_C as
select
   1 r
from
   tq84_A@dblink a                 join
   tq84_B@dblink b on a.id = b.id
;
code }


  When I drop the `clb` column on the remote database, I can also create the table with the `row_number()` function:
code {
alter table tq84_B drop column clb;

create table …
code }

}
