$ ORA-00975: date + date not allowed

Statements such as the following where two → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[dates] are added throw *ORA-00975: date + date not allowed*
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate + → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

In contrast, it's possible to add a number to a date (so-called *date arithmetic*):
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/date/sysdate + 1.5 dt
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

sa:
  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[`date` datatype]

  → development/databases/Oracle/errors[Other Oracle error messages]
