$ ORA-12838: cannot read/modify an object after modifying it in parallel

Make sure our session is enabled for parallel DML:
code {
select pdml_status from v$session where sid = sys_context('userenv', 'sid');
alter session enable parallel dml;
code }

Create a table for the result:
code {
create table tq84_objs (own varchar2(128), nam varchar2(128));
code }

Insert data with parallel execution:
code {
insert /*+ parallel */ into tq84_objs
select
   owner,
   object_name
from
   dba_objects;
code }

Verify if statement was executed in parallel:
code {
select * from v$pq_sesstat order by statistic;
code }

Following statement throws *ORA-12838: cannot read/modify an object after modifying it in parallel*:
code {
delete from tq84_objs where own = 'SYS';
code }

We have to commit the transaction in order to further modify data in the table:
code {
commit;
delete from tq84_objs where own = 'SYS';
code }
