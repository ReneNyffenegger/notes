$ ORA-01873: the leading precision of the interval is too small 

The first of the following two statements returns an interval of 24855 days, 3 hours, 14 minutes and 7 seconds.

The second statement throws *ORA-01873: the leading precision of the interval is too small*.
code {
select numtodsinterval(power(2, 31) - 1, 'second') as interval from dual;
select numtodsinterval(power(2, 31)    , 'second') as interval from dual;
code }


Similar with the following two statements:
code {
select (interval '0 06:54:15' day(9) to second(3)) * 86400 from dual;
select (interval '0 06:54:16' day(9) to second(3)) * 86400 from dual;
code }
