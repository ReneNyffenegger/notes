$ ORA-01403: no data found

{ Error not thrown in PL/SQL functions executed from SELECT statement #ora-1403-plsql-func

  This error is not thrown if the SQL statement is executed in a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/function-procedure[PL/SQL function] which is called from a `select` statement

  In order to demonstrate this behavior, a test table is created and filled with one record:
code {
create table tq84_test (
   id    number,
   val   varchar2(20)
);

insert into tq84_test values (42, 'forty-two' );
commit;
code }

  A function is created that selects the `val` value of the record in that table whose `id` matches the passed parameter. After selecting this value,
  an exception is thrown (`→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/exception/raise_application_error`):
code {
create or replace function tq84_fnc(id number)
   return varchar2
   authid definer
as
   ret varchar2(20);
begin

   select val into ret
   from   tq84_test t
   where  t.id =  tq84_fnc.id;

   raise_application_error(-20800, 'sql%rowcount = ' || sql%rowcount);
  
   return ret;
end tq84_fnc;
/
code }

  When exececuted with an id that does not exist in the table, the function expectedly throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01403_no-data-found:
code {
begin
   dbms_output.put_line(tq84_fnc(1));
end;
/
code }

  The `id` 42 exists, so the user defined exception (*ORA-20800: sql%rowcount = 1*) is thrown, which is also expected:
code {
begin
   dbms_output.put_line(tq84_fnc(42));
end;
/
code }

  This exception is also thrown in the following `select` statement:
code {
select tq84_fnc(42) from dual;
code }

  However, the following `select` statement returns, possibly unexpectedly, `null` (rather than raising ORA-01403):
code {
select tq84_fnc(1) from dual;
code }

  Cleaning up
code {
drop function tq84_fnc; 
drop table    tq84_test;
code }

}
{ ORA-00100 #ora-01403-00100

  ORA-01403 seems to be related to ORA-00100:
code {
SQL> exec dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm(-1403))
ORA-01403: no data found

SQL> exec dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm(-100))
ORA-00100: no data found

SQL> exec dbms_output.put_line(sqlerrm(100))
ORA-01403: no data found
code }
