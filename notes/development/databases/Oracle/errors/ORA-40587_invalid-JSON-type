$ ORA-40587: invalid JSON type

The following `select` statement produces an *ORA-40587: invalid JSON type* error.
code {
select → development/databases/Oracle/installed/types/json/object_t('{"num": 42, "txt": "hello world"}') from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }
 

However, this → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block runs fine:
code {
declare
   j json_object_t;
begin
   j := json_object_t('{"num": 42, "txt": "hello world"}');
end;
/
code }

My *assumption* (!) is that this error is thrown in SQL because `json_object_t` is not a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/types#ora-plsql-type-persistable[persistable type].

sa:

  → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-40573_invalid-use-of-PL_SQL-JSON-object-type

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/types/json[JSON related PL/SQL object types]
