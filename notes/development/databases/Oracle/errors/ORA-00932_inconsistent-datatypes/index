$ ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected … got …

An *ORA-00932* is thrown when a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data type] cannot be converated to another.
-
In Oracle versions prior to → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c, the message is *ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected … got …*, with the «error message improvement program», the messages
changed to *ORA-00932: expression is of data type …, which is incompatible with expected data type …*.

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[data type] of the column
  `data_default` in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] view
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/columns[`user_tab_columns`] is
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/long[`long`] which essentially makes it impossible
  to formulate a query-condition on that column when selecting from `user_tab_columns`:
code {
select *
from
   user_tab_columns
where
   data_default like '%sysdate%';
code }

{ ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got CLOB #ora-00932-exp-got-clob

  It's not possible to execute a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` on a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob#ora-lob-group-by[`clob` (or `blob`)] value.
  The following `select` statement raises a *ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got CLOB* error:
code {
create table tq84_ora_00932_clob (
    val number,
    txt clob
);
 
select
   txt,
   max(val) max_val
from
   tq84_ora_00932_clob
group by
   txt;
code }
  
    Similarly, it's not possible to use → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate[aggregate functions] on LOB values, the following statement raises the same error:
code {
select
   count(txt)
from
   tq84_ora_00932_clob;
code }
  
  Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_ora_00932_clob;
code }

  { Comparing a CLOB with a VARCHAR2/string

    This error is also thrown when a `clob` is compared with a `varchar2` value (see → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-22848_cannot-use_type-as-comparison-key).

   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob/api/compare[`dbms_lob.compare`] can be used to

  The following statement throws *ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got -* (23c: *ORA-00932: expression is of data type CHAR, which is incompatible with expected data type XMLTYPE*):
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/XML/extractvalue(         '<e>hello world</e>'   , '/e') e
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }
 
  Using `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/types/XMLType` is better:
code {
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/XML/extractvalue( → development/databases/Oracle/installed/types/XMLType('<e>hello world</e>')  , '/e') e
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

}
{ ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected NUMBER got CLOB

  Preparation for demonstration:
code {
create table tq84_src_varchar2 (id integer, val varchar2(20));
create table tq84_src_clob     (id integer, val clob        );
create table tq84_dest         (id integer, val number (7,2));
 
 
begin
   insert into tq84_src_varchar2 values (1, 111);
   insert into tq84_src_clob     select * from tq84_src_varchar2;
   commit;
end;
/
code }
 
  The following `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert` statement runs without problems, i. e. the `varchar2` of the source table is implicitely converted to a `number`: 
code {
insert into tq84_dest select * from tq84_src_varchar2;
code }

  However, this `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert` statement throws *ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected NUMBER got CLOB* (or
 *ORA-00932: expression is of data type CLOB, which is incompatible with expected data type NUMBER* with improved error messages).
  -
  Apparently, a `clob` is not implicitely converted:
code {
insert into tq84_dest select * from tq84_src_clob    ;
code }
 
  Cleaning up:
code { 
drop table tq84_dest;
drop table tq84_src_clob;
drop table tq84_src_varchar2;
code }
