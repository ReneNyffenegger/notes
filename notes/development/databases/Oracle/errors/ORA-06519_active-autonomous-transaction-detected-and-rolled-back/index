$ ORA-06519: active autonomous transaction detected and rolled back

code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return clob as
    pragma autonomous_transaction;
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    return stmt;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }

code {
create table tq84_test(a number);
code }

The following statement throws *ORA-06519: active autonomous transaction detected and rolled back*:
code {
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
code }

In order to prevent this error, an explicit `commit` (or `rollback`) is required in the function:
code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return clob as
    pragma autonomous_transaction;
begin

    execute immediate stmt;

    COMMIT;
    return stmt;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }
