$ ORA-00438: … Option not installed

In an Oracle database where *Real Application Testing* (RAT) is not installed, the following statement throws *ORA-00438: Real Application Testing Option not installed*:
code {
begin
   dbms_workload_capture.start_capture (
      name     => 'capture-test-1',
      dir      => 'CAPTURE_TEST',
      duration => NULL
   );
end;
/
code }

code {
select value from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/option where parameter = 'Real Application Testing';
