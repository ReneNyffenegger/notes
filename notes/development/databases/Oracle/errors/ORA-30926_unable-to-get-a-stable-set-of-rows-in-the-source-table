$ ORA-30926: unable to get a stable set of rows in the source tables

{ Demonstration of the error

  Create two → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] and populate them with a few records.
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/schema#ora-create-schema[create schema] authorization rene
 create table tq84_dst (id number, txt varchar2(5))
 create table tq84_src (id number, txt varchar2(5))
; 
 
begin
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (1);
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (2);
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (3);
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (4);
  
 insert into tq84_src values (1, 'one');
 insert into tq84_src values (2, 'two');
 insert into tq84_src values (3, 'three');
end;
/
code }

  The following statement runs without problems and merges three records:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/merge into tq84_dst dst
   using (
       select
          id,
          txt
       from
          tq84_src
   ) src
   on (
       dst.id = src.id
   )
   when matched then update
        set dst.txt = src.txt;
code }

  Add another record to `tq84_src` so that `id` is not unique anymore:
code {
-- update tq84_src set txt = upper(txt);       
insert into tq84_src values (2, 'two');
code }

  When running the `merge` statement again, it produces *ORA-30926: unable to get a stable set of rows in the source tables*.

  However, when the record  with `id=2` is deleted in `tq84_dst`, the statement runs again (but will only merge two records, obviously).
