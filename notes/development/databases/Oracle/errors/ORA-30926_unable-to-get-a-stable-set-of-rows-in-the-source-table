$ ORA-30926: unable to get a stable set of rows in the source tables

{ Demonstration of the error

  Create two → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] and populate them with a few records.
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/schema#ora-create-schema[create schema] authorization rene
 create table tq84_dst (id number, txt varchar2(5))
 create table tq84_src (id number, txt varchar2(5))
; 
 
begin
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (1);
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (2);
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (3);
 insert into tq84_dst (id) values (4);
  
 insert into tq84_src values (1, 'one');
 insert into tq84_src values (2, 'two');
 insert into tq84_src values (3, 'three');
end;
/
code }

  The following statement runs without problems and merges three records from the source table (`tq84_src`) into the destination table (`tq84_dst`):
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/merge into tq84_dst dst
   using tq84_src src
   on ( dst.id = src.id)
   when matched then update
        set dst.txt = src.txt;
code }

  If we add two records for `id=4` into  `tq84_src`…
code {
insert into tq84_src values (4, 'four');
insert into tq84_src values (4, 'FOUR');
code }
  …the merge statement is not deterministic, i. e. it is not clear whether the value if the destination table's record where `id=4` should be updated
  to `four` or `FOUR`.
  -
  So, when running the `merge` statement again, it produces *ORA-30926: unable to get a stable set of rows in the source tables*.

  However, when the record  with `id=4` is deleted in `tq84_dst`, the statement runs again (but will only merge two records, obviously).

}
{ Special circumstance where the error is not thrown

  Records in the source that already have the same value as that found in the destination don't seem to be counted as having updated the destination record, the
  following sample doesn't, *unexepectedly to me*, throw the error:
code {
drop table tq84_src;
drop table tq84_dst;

create table tq84_src (
   id  integer,
   val varchar2(10)
);
create table tq84_dst (
   id  integer,
   val varchar2(10)
);

begin
   insert into tq84_dst (id, val) values (1, 'one'  );
  
   insert into tq84_src (id, val) values (1, 'one'  );
   insert into tq84_src (id, val) values (1, 'one'  );
   insert into tq84_src (id, val) values (1, 'one'  );
   insert into tq84_src (id, val) values (1, 'ONE'  );
  
end;
/
   
   
merge into tq84_dst d
using
   tq84_src s
on
   ( s.id = d.id )
when
   matched then update set d.val = s.val;
   

select * from tq84_dst;   
code }

  It's unclear to me if this behavior is specified or a bug.

}
{ Changed error message

  With → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c, the error message has changed from *unable to get a stable set of rows in the source tables* to
 *The operation attempted to update the same row (rowid: …) twice*.

}

sa:

  An ORA-30926 error can be thrown when using the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/update/from[`from` clause in an `update` statement] (→ development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c).
