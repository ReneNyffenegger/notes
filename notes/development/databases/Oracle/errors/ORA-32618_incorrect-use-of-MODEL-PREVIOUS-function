$ ORA-32618: incorrect use of MODEL PREVIOUS function

The `previous()` can only be used within the `iterate … until` clause of a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model` statement.

Because this function is used outside of the `iterate` clause, the following statement throws the *ORA-32618: incorrect use of MODEL PREVIOUS function* error:
code {
select *
from
   dual 
model
   dimension by (0 as id )
   measures     (0 as num)
 rules
   (
      num[iteration_number] = previous(num[iteration_number])
   );
code }

sa:
  Oracle's `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model` clause
