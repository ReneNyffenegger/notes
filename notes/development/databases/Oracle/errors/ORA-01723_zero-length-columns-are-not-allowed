$ ORA-01723: zero-length columns are not allowed

The following `create table` statement throws the error *ORA-01723: zero-length columns are not allowed*:
code {
create table
   tq84_ora_01723 as
select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null as n
from
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

It is possible to create a table with initial `null` values if these are cast into a datatype:
code {
create table
   tq84_ora_01723 as
select
   cast(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null as varchar2(100)) as n
from
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }
