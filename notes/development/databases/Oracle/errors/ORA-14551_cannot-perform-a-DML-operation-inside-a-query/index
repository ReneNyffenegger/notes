$ ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query 

code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return number as
begin

    → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate stmt;
    return sql%rowcount;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }

code {
create table tq84_test(a number);
code }

The following statement throws a *ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query* error message:
code {
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
code }

Compile the function with → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/pragma/autonomous_transaction[`pragma autonomous_transaction`] …
code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return number as
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    return sql%rowcount;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }

… and try again. This time, it throws → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-06519_active-autonomous-transaction-detected-and-rolled-back.
code {
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
code }

code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return number as
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    commit;
    return sql%rowcount;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }

Finally, we can execute the DML in the function:
code {
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop function exec_immediate;
drop table    tq84_test purge;
code }
