$ ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query 

code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return clob as
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    return stmt;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }

code {
create table tq84_test(a number);
code }

The following statement throws a *ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query* error message:
code {
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
code }

Compile the function with → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/pragma/autonomous_transaction[`pragma autonomous_transaction`] …
code {
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return clob as
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    return stmt;

end exec_immediate;
/
code }

… and try again. This time, it throws *ORA-06519: active autonomous transaction detected and rolled back*.
code {
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
code }
