$ ORA-01720: grant option does not exist for …

Create three → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users[users]:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/connect rene/rene

create user tq84_a identified by tq84_a quota unlimited on users;
create user tq84_b identified by tq84_b quota unlimited on users;
create user tq84_c identified by tq84_c quota unlimited on users;

→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant create session, create table, create view to tq84_c;
code }

User `A` creates a table …
code {
connect tq84_a/tq84_a; 
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/table/create t (a number, b varchar2(10));
code }

… and grants `select` to `tq84_b` *with* …
code {
grant select on t to tq84_b with grant option;
code }

… and to `tq84_c` *without grant option*:
code {
grant select on t to tq84_c;
code }

User `tq84_b` creates a table and a view that selects from from tq84_a's table as well as from its own table:
code {
connect tq84_b/tq84_b; 

create table t (a number, b varchar2(10));

create view v as 
  select * from tq84_a.t union all
  select * from tq84_b.t;
code }

Because `tq84_b` granted `select` *with* grant option, he can «pass on» selectability:
code {
grant select on v to tq84_c;
code }

User `tq84_c` does the same thing…
code {
connect tq84_c/tq84_c

create table t (a number, b varchar2(10));

create view v as 
  select * from tq84_a.t union all
  select * from tq84_c.t;
code }


… but the following `grant` throws *ORA-01720: grant option does not exist for TQ84_A.T*:
code {
grant select on v to tq84_b;
code }


Cleaning up:
code {
connect rene/rene
drop user tq84_a;
drop user tq84_b;
drop user tq84_c;
code }
