$ ORA-02297: cannot disable constraint … - dependencies exist

Create some tables in parent child relationship:

code {
create table tq84_P (
   id  number,
   constraint tq84_P_pk primary key (id)
);

create table tq84_C (
   id   number,
   id_P not null,
   --
   constraint tq84_C_pk primary key (id  ),
   constraint tq84_C_fk foreign key (id_P) references tq84_P
);

create table tq84_CC (
   id   number,
   id_C not null,
   --
   constraint tq84_CC_pk primary key (id  ),
   constraint tq84_CC_fk foreign key (id_C) references tq84_C
);
code }

Try to disable a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key. It does not work because there is a referring table.
-
The error *ORA-02297: cannot disable constraint (RENE.TQ84_P_PK) - dependencies exist* will be thrown:
code {
alter table tq84_P disable primary key;
code }

With the `cascade` clause, however, the primary key can be disabled.
code {
alter table tq84_P disable primary key CASCADE;
code }

The previous command also disabled the foreign key of `TQ84_C` (but not of `TQ84_CC`):
code {
select
   con.table_name,
   con.constraint_type,
   con.constraint_name,
   con.status,
   con.deferred
from
   user_constraints con
where
   con.table_name      in ('TQ84_P', 'TQ84_C', 'TQ84_CC') and
   con.constraint_type in ('P', 'R')
order by
   con.table_name;
code }
   

Note: there is no corresponding `alter table enable primary key cascade`, unfortunately.


code {
drop table tq84_CC;
drop table tq84_C ;
drop table tq84_P ;
code }
