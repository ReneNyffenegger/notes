$ ORA-04031: unable to allocate … bytes of shared memory

The *ORA-04031 unable to allocate … bytes of shared memory* might cause some irritation when it reports, that a (relatively small) amount of memory cannot be allocated even though
there is plenty of free memory in the System.
-
This is because the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool#ora-shared-pool-alloc-mem[Shared pool heap manager] allocates *contiguous* memory and the largest chunk
of contiguous memory might be well below the total amount of free memory.

The most obvious fix for ORA-04031 errors is to increase the size of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool. When doing that, it might be useful to
consult `v$shared_pool_advice`.
-
Others solutions include:
  • Reducing the value of `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/session/cached/cursors`
  • Reducing the value of `cursor_space_for_time`

sa:

  While ORA-04031 indicates a problem in the → ,development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA,
  the error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-out-of-process-memory-when-trying-to-allocate_bytes is related to a similar problem for the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA.
