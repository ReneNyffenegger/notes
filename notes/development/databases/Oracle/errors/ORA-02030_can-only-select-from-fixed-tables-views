$ ORA-02030: can only select from fixed tables/views

The following statement throws *ORA-02030: can only select from fixed tables/views* because `V$SESSION` is a
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms to `V_$SESSION` (as is → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views#ora-vS-synonyms[the case] for all → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views[so called V$ views]):
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant select on v$session to rene;
code }

This statement runs ok (if the grantor has admin privileges for this `select` right):
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant select on v_$session to rene;
code }


An *ORA-02030: can only select from fixed tables/views* is also thrown for the same reason with the following `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/revoke` statement:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/revoke select on v$session from rene;
code }

This one runs ok:
code {
revoke select on v_$session from rene;
code }
