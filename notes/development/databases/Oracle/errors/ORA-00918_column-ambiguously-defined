$ ORA-00918: column ambiguously defined

code {
create table tq84_tab_a (id_a  integer, num number, txt varchar2(10));
create table tq84_tab_b (id_b  integer, num number, dt  date        );
code }

OK:
code {
select
   id_a,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab_a    join
   tq84_tab_b on id_a = id_b;
code }
   
The → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns `num` is found in both tables, → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables], `tq84_tab_a` and `tq84_tab_b`, the identifier is therefore abmbiguous and
causes the error *ORA-00918: column ambiguously defined*:
code {
select
   id_a,
   num
from
   tq84_tab_a                 join
   tq84_tab_b on id_a = id_b;
code }


Use *table aliases* to get rid of the error:
code {
select
   A.id_a,
   B.num
from
   tq84_tab_a A                      join
   tq84_tab_b B  on A.id_a = B.id_b;
code }

code {
drop table tq84_tab_a;
drop table tq84_tab_b;
code }

{ Subquery

  The following query, executed in a tool like → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus or
  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer[SQL Developer], runs fine, even though the column name `NUM` appears twice. Oracle silently renames the second `NUM` to `NUM_1`:
code {
select
   4   num,
   8   num,
  'x'  txt
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

  This query can be used as a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery as long as `NUM` is not selected from the subquery, i. e. the following statement runs fine as well:
code {
select txt from (
   select
      4   num,
      8   num,
      7   num_1,
     'x'  txt
   from
      dual
);
code }

  However, if either `NUM` or `*` is selected from this subquery, the ORA-00918 error is raised, as demonstrated with the following query:
code {
select * from (
   select
      4   num,
      8   num,
     'x'  txt
   from
      dual
);
code }

}
