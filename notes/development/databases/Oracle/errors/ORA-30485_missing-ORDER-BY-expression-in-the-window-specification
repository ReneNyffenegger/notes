$ ORA-30485: missing ORDER BY expression in the window specification

Some → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/analytic[analytic functions] require an `ORDER BY` expression. Without such an expression, the
*ORA-30485: missing ORDER BY expression in the window specification* is thrown, as for example in the following SQL statement:
code {
select
       object_type                                     typ,
       object_name                                     obj,
   lag(object_name, 1) over (partition by object_type) obj_lag
from
   user_objects
order by
   object_name
;
code }

The following statement has such on `order by` clause and doesn't throw this error:
code {
select
       object_type                                     typ,
       object_name                                     obj,
   lag(object_name, 1) over (partition by object_type
                             ORDER     BY object_name) obj_lag
from
   user_objects
;
code }
