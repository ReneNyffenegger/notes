$ ORA-00937: not a single-group group function

Using an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate and at least one non aggregated column without
a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` clause causes the error *ORA-00937: not a single-group group function* to be thrown.
(but compare with → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00979_not-a-GROUP-BY-expression).


Test table:
code {
create table tq84_tab (
   num   number,
   txt   varchar2(10)
);
code }

The following statement throws ORA-00937:
code {
select
   sum(num)   sum_num,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab;
code }

The following query is OK, though:
code {
select
   sum(num)   sum_num,
   txt
from
   tq84_tab
group by
   txt;
code }


Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_tab;
code }
