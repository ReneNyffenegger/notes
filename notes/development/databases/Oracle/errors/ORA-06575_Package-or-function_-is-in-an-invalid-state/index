insert into tq84_tab values(42);

Error not yet recognized:
code {
select * from user_errors where name = 'TQ84_FNC';
code }

Only by executing the following `select` statement, Oracle realizes that the function has become invalid and throws
*ORA-06575: Package or function TQ84_FNC is in an invalid state*.
code {
select tq84_fnc from dual;
code }

Because `tq84_fnc` was recompiled to be used in the `select` statement, an error is now recored in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/errors[`user_errors`]:
code {
select text from user_errors where name = 'TQ84_FNC';
--
-- PL/SQL: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

Cleaning up
code {
drop table tq84_tab;
drop function tq84_fnc;
code }
