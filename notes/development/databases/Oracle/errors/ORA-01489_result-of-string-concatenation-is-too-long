$ ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long

The maximum length of a string that can created from string concatenation in (Oracle)
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] is 4000 characters if the value of
`→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/max/string_size` is `STANDARD` or 32767 if this value is `EXTENDED`.
-

If the length of the created string exceeds this limit, Oracle will throw an *ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long* error.

The following statement selects a concatenated string with exactly this amount of characters. Adding *only one character* will cause the error message (assuming the value of `max_string_size` is `STANDARD`):
