$ ORA-00923: FROM keyword not found where expected

{ Missing commas in select list

  The error message *ORA-00923: FROM keyword not found where expected* might be caused by a missing comma in
  the selected columns of a `select` statement:
  code {
  select
     obj.object_name,
     obj.object_type    -- <== Note the missing comma!
     obj.last_ddl_time,
     obj_status
  from
     user_objects obj;
  code }

}
{ Using a keyword as alias #ora-00923-column-alias

  Another reason for this error is to use a keyword (such as `share`) for a column-alias:

code {
select
   '82.3 percent'  as share
from
   dual;
code }


  Keywords can be quoted (`"..."`) if the column really needs to be named after a reserved word:
code {
select
   '82.3 percent'  as "SHARE"
from
   dual;
code }

  Keywords can be found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/reserved_words[`v$reserved_words`]:
code {
select
   keyword
from
   v$reserved_words
where
   reserved = 'Y'
code }

}
