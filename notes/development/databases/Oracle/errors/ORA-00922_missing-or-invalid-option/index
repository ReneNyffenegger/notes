$ ORA-00922: missing or invalid option

{ Trailing semicolons in SQL statements

  While semicolons are typically used in SQL scripts to separate → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statements] from one another
  (for example when executed with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/start[`start`] command of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus),
  the semicolons are not part of the SQL statement. In fact, Oracle will throw an *ORA-00922* error when it tries to parse such an SQL statement:
code {
begin
   → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate 'create table tq84_xyz(a number);';
end;
/
code }

}
{ Missing semiicolon

  This error is also thrown when an SQL script contains multiple SQL statements, but two adjacent statements are *not* separated by a semicolon, such as in the following case:
code {
create table tq84_tab_one (
   col  number
)

create table tq84_tab_two (
   col number
);
code }

}
