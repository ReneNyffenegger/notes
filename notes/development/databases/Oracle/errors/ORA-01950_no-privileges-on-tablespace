$ ORA-01950: no privileges on tablespace '…'

Most likely, the user has no → ora/concepts/tablespaces.html#quota[quota] granted on the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace in which he wants to create a table or index. 

code {
select 
   bytes,
   max_bytes,
   dropped
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ts_quotas
where
   tablespace_name = '…' and
   username        = '…'
;
code }

A quota can be assigned to the user with
code {
alter  user USER_ABC quota 500 GB    on TABLESPACE_XYZ;
alter  user USER_ABC quota unlimited on TABLESPACE_XYZ;
code }

Alternatively, the `UNLIMITED TABLESPACE` → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[system privilege] can be given to the user.
