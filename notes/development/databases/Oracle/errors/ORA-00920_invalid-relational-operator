$ ORA-00920: invalid relational operator

A simple → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables:
code {
create table tq84_ora_00920 (
    id  integer   generated always as identity,
    prt varchar2( 3),
    txt varchar2(20)
);
code }
 
The following → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement is syntactically incorrect: it ends with a comma. When trying to execute it, Oracle will throw
→ development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00936_missing-expression.
code {
select
   max(id),
   prt
from
   tq84_ora_00920
group by
   prt,
;
code }
 

However, a select statement that uses same query in a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/subquery, will throw
*ORA-00920: invalid relational operator*:
code {
select
   prt,
   txt
from
   tq84_ora_00920
where
  (id, prt) in (
     select
        max(id),
        prt
     from
        tq84_ora_00920
     group by
        prt,     -- <=== ORA-00920: invalid relational operator
   );
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_ora_00920;
code }
