$ ORA-00600: internal error code…

*ORA-00600* errors indicate internal exceptions which are handled by the Oracle Kernel.
-
In contrast, the error messages → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-07445_exception-encountered_core-dump indicates an OS exception that is not handled by Oracle.

rem {
{ ORA-00600 [17…]

    ORA-00600 [17…] ☰ Core dump in any function related to manipulation of memory structures.

}
{ Memory leak errors

  table { ll

{ Arguments/parameters

  This error comes with multiple arguments/parameters.

  The first parameter of the *ORA-00600* error message is either a
    • number, which reflects the source component or layer the error is connected with, or a
    • mnemonic which indicates the source module where the error originated.

  The mnemonic is preferred.

{ Automatic Error Mitigation (AEM)

 *Automatic Error Mitigation* is a framework that automatically mitigates errors that occur during SQL statement compilation without user intervention in the Autonomous Database.
  -
  AEM includes optimization and code generation.

  AEM was introducted with Oracle 23ai.

  There are three types of mitigation strategies:
    • Failover to a execution plan that is known to have worked in the past
    • Using hints, identified by the optimizer, that specifically target the errir
    • Using hints to modify the global configuration

  The information about the error and the mitigation is kept (likely in trace files) for Oracle support.

  See also the init paramter `sql_error_mitigation` and the data dictionary view `dba_sql_error_mitigations`.
