$ ORA-40478: output value too large (maximum: N)

The following statement is likely to throw an *ORA-40478* error:
code {
select
   owner,
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/arrayagg(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/array(
      obj.object_name,
      obj.object_type,
      obj.created
   ))
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects obj
where
   obj.owner not in ('SYS', 'SYSTEM')
group by
   owner;
code }
   
   
Use the `returning clob` clause for the `json_arrayagg` function to prevent the ORA-40478 error:
code {
select
   owner,
   json_arrayagg(json_array(
      obj.object_name,
      obj.object_type,
      obj.created
   )
   RETURNING CLOB
   )
from
   dba_objects obj
where
   obj.owner not in ('SYS', 'SYSTEM')
group by
   owner;
code }
