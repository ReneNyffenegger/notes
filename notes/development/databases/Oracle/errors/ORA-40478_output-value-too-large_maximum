$ ORA-40478: output value too large (maximum: N)

The following statement is likely to throw an *ORA-40478* error:
code {
select
   owner,
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/arrayagg(→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/array(
      obj.object_name,
      obj.object_type,
      obj.created
   ))
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects obj
where
   obj.owner not in ('SYS', 'SYSTEM')
group by
   owner;
code }
   
   
Use the `returning clob` clause for the `json_arrayagg` function to prevent the ORA-40478 error:
code {
select
   owner,
   json_arrayagg(json_array(
      obj.object_name,
      obj.object_type,
      obj.created
   )
   RETURNING CLOB
   )
from
   dba_objects obj
where
   obj.owner not in ('SYS', 'SYSTEM')
group by
   owner;
code }

Forcing an *ORA-40478* error with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/error-clause[`error` clause for `json_table`]:
code {
select * from
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/table ('[
     [1, "one"  , "B"],
     [2, "two"  , "C"],
     [3, "three", "D"],
     [4, "four" , "E"],
    ]',
   '$[*]'
    → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/error-clause[ERROR ON ERROR]
    columns
       id    number  ( 1) path '$[0]' ,
       num   varchar2( 4) path '$[1]' ,
       meta  varchar2( 3) path '$[2]'
    );
