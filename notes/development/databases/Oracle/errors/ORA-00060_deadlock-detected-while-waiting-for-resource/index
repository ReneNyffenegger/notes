$ ORA-00060: deadlock detected while waiting for resource

The error *ORA-00060: deadlock detected while waiting for resource* is thrown if two sessions (or possibly more accurately: two transactions) wait for a resource that the
other session (transaction) has already aquired.

Jonathan Lewis → https://books.google.ch/books?id=hmYpj1OI0DoC&pg=PA82[has found that the session that waited the longest] gets the ORA-00060.

{ Demonstration

  Create some demonstration values:
code {
create table tq84_00600_deadlock (
   id   integer  primary key,
   val  varchar2(20)
);

begin
   insert into tq84_00600_deadlock values (42, 'A');
   insert into tq84_00600_deadlock values (99, 'B');
   commit;
end;
/
code }

~Session 1~ updates a record but does not commit the transaction:
code {
update tq84_00600_deadlock set val = 'C' where id = 42;
code }

~Session 2~ updates another record, also without commiting the transaction:
code {
update tq84_00600_deadlock set val = 'X' where id = 99;
code }

~Session 2~ tries to update the record which is already updated by another session (i. e. *session 1*). Because the other session locks the records,
session 2 is blocked with the following update statement:
code {
update tq84_00600_deadlock set val = 'Y' where id = 42;
code }

~Sesion 1~ tries to update the record which is already updated by *session 2*:
code {
update tq84_00600_deadlock set val = 'D' where id = 99;
code }

  This update staement leads to a situation where both would be blocked. Oracle handles this by raising *ORA-00060: deadlock detected while waiting for resource* in one of the two sessions.

  Cleaning up:
code {
drop   table tq84_00600_deadlock;
code }

}
