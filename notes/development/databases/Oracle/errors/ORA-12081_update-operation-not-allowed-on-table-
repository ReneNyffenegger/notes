$ ORA-12081: update operation not allowed on table ‥

code {
create table tq84_x(a number);

begin
   insert into tq84_x values (1);
   insert into tq84_x values (2);
   insert into tq84_x values (3);
   commit
end;

code }

Making the → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/read-only[read-only]:
code {
alter table tq84_x read only;
code }

Each of the following statements throws *ORA-12081: update operation not allowed on table "RENE"."TQ84_X"*:
code {
insert into tq84_x values (-1);
delete from tq84_x where a > 10;
delete from tq84_x where a = 1;
update tq84_x set a = 5 where a = 3;
code }

Enable → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML] again:
code {
alter table tq84_x read write;
code }

Cleaning up:
code {
drop table tq84_x;
code }
