{ Changing password in SQL*Plus

  An expired password can be changed with SQL*Plus: this tool will ask for a new password when it receives an ORA-28001.

{ Changing a password with ALTER USER privileges

  A user having the `alter user` → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[system privilege] can change a user's password:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/user[alter user] rene identified by theNewSecretPassword;
code }

}
{ Altering the password expiration policy

 «Create» the `alter profile` statement with which the profile of a given user can be altered so that the password life is infinite.
code {
select 'alter profile ' || profile || ' limit password_life_time unlimited;' from dba_users where username = 'RENE';
code }

  Executing the statement will change the password expiration policy for *all* users with this profile! This might or might not be what is intended.
code {
alter profile DEFAULT limit password_life_time unlimited;
code }

  Executing the `alter profile` statement does not automatically unlock the user.
