$ ORA-41904: Missing object privilege on … to create a view.

User RENE tries to create view and gets the error message *ORA-41904: Missing object privilege on "SYS"."DBA_TAB_COMMENTS" to create a view.*:
code {
create view tq84_x as
select *
from
   dba_tab_comments;  
code }

Someone with better privileges helps:
code {
grant select on dba_tab_comments to rene;
code }

Now, the view can be created by RENE.

{ Granting select on all dictionary views

  Alternatively, it's possible to grant select on all → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary views] by granting the `select any dictionary`
  → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges/system[system privilege] to a user:
code {
grant select any dictionary to rene;
code }

}
