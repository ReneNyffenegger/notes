$ ORA-41904: Missing object privilege on â€¦ to create a view.

User RENE tries to create view and gets the error message *ORA-41904: Missing object privilege on "SYS"."DBA_TAB_COMMENTS" to create a view.*:
code {
create view tq84_x as
select *
from
   dba_tab_comments;  
code }

Someone with better privileges helps:
code {
grant select on dba_tab_comments to rene;
code }

Now, the view can be created by RENE.
