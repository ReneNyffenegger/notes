$ ORA-40573: invalid use of PL/SQL JSON object type

This statement throws *ORA-40573: invalid use of PL/SQL JSON object type*:
code {
select
   json_array_t(json_arrayagg(column_name))
from
   dba_tab_cols
where
   owner      = 'SYS'                   and
   table_name = 'USER_TAB_COMMENTS'
;
code }
 
So does this statement:
code {
select
   json_array_t('["TABLE_NAME","TABLE_TYPE","COMMENTS","ORIGIN_CON_ID"]')
from
   dual;
code }
 

The following → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block runs fine, however: 
code {
declare
   a json_array_t;
begin
   a := json_array_t('["TABLE_NAME","TABLE_TYPE","COMMENTS","ORIGIN_CON_ID"]');
end;
/ 
code }

My *assumption* (!) is that this error is thrown in SQL because `json_object_t` is not a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/types#ora-plsql-type-persistable[persistable type].
