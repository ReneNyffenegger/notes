$ ORA-01790: expression must have same datatype as corresponding expression

Cause ORA-01790: 
code {
select    1     as  x  from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all
select   'two'  as  x  from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }

Cause another ORA-01790: 
code {
select   'two'  as  x  from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all
select    2     as  x  from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }


Use `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to/char` to prevent the error:
code {
select   to_char(1) as  x  from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/union/all
select   'two'      as  x  from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual;
code }
