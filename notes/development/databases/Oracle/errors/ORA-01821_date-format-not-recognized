$ ORA-01821: date format not recognized

{ Fractional seconds

The following statement throws *ORA-01821: date format not recognized* (note the three f's with which the user tries to accommodate for the three fractional digits):
code {
select
   to_timestamp('2025-01-13 07:16:14.353', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss.fff')
from
   dual;
code }

With only two f's, the query runs ok:
code {
select
   to_timestamp('2025-01-13 07:16:14.353', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss.ff')
from
   dual;
code }

}
