→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/sequences[Sequences] are not allowed in `where` conditions; the following statement throws *ORA-02287: sequence number not allowed here*:
code {
select val from tq84_tab where id = tq84_seq.currval;
code }

Sequences are also not allowed with → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[`with` clauses], the same error is thrown:
code {
with seqval as (select tq84_seq.currval curid from → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual)
select
   val
from
   tq84_seq       join
   seqval   on id = curid;
