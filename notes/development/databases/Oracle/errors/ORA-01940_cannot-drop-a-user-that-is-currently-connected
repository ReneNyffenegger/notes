$ ORA-01940: cannot drop a user that is currently connected

A user that has open → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions] cannot be dropped, in such a case, the following statement would throw the error meesage *ORA-01940: cannot drop a user that is currently connected*:
code {
drop user k cascade;
code }

Generate → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/system/alter#ora-alter-system-end-session[`alter system kill session`] statements for each session that the user has open:
code {
select
  'alter system kill session ''' || sid || ',' || serial# || ''' immediate;'  stmt
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[gv$session]
where
   username ='K';
code }

The following anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block uses `→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate` to execute the statements created with the previous `select` statement.
-
In addition, it uses the `force` option available with → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/23c to *immediatly* terminate all sessions of a given user:
code {
begin
   for r in (
      select
        'alter system kill session ''' || sid || ',' || serial# ||
           case when → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/db_version#dbms_version-version-release[dbms_db_version.version] >= 23 then ' force' end ||
        ''''   stmt
      from
         → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[gv$session]
      where
         username ='GTFS_ZURICH') loop

         → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate r.stmt;
    end loop;
end;
/
code }
