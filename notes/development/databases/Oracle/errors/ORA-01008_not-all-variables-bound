$ ORA-01008: not all variables bound

The following SQL statement is parametrized with two → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/bind-variables[bind variables], but only one bind variable is bound. Hence, Oracle throws
*ORA-01008: not all variables bound*.

code {
declare
  cnt number;
begin
   → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/execute-immediate
      'select
          count(*)
       from
          dual
       where
          1 = :a and
          2 = :b'
   into cnt
   using 1;
end;
/
code }

In SQL*Plus, this error can also be forced like so
code {
SQL> set → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/define off
SQL> var res varchar2
SQL> exec execute immediate 'select dummy from dual where 1 = &num' into :res;
code }
