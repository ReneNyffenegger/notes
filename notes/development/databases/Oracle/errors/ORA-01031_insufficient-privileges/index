$ ORA-01031: insufficient privileges

The error *ORA-01031: insufficient privileges* is typically thrown if a → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users lacks a → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privilege] to execute
an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement[SQL statement] (when already connected to the database, in contrast to → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-01031_insufficient-privileges which is raised if a user cannot be authenticated
to connect to the database).

Necessary privileges can be given to a user (or a role) with the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant[`grant`] statement.

{ Starting an instance #ora-01031-start-instance

  If this error is thrown when an instance is → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/startup-shutdown[started up], it might indicate that the user trying to start the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance does not belong to the `ora_dba` → Windows/user-account/group on Windows or `dba` group on Unix.

  On Windows, a user can be added to the → Windows/user-account/group[Window group] with
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe/localgroup[net localgroup] ora_dba rene /add
code }
