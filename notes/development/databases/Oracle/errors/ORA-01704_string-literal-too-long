$ ORA-01704: string literal too long

The following SQL statement selects a string whose length is exactly 4000 characters. If *only* one character were added, Oracle would throw a *ORA-01704: string literal too long* error because the maximum length
of string literals in SQL statements is 4000.

from
  dual;
code }

A workaround for such errors is to create a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[CLOBs] by concatenating CLOBs whose length is less then 4000 characters:
code {
select
   to_clob('string with less than 4000') ||
   to_clob('string with less than 4000') …
from
  dual;
code }

If long strings are needed for → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statements], a workaround is to use an anonymous → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block:
code {
declare
   txt clob := q'[ imagine long text here ]';
begin
   update tab set xyz = txt where id = 42;
end;
/
code }
