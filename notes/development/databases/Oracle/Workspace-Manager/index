$ Oracle Workspace Manager
@ Workspace Manager

With Oracle's *Workspace Manager*, its possible to store multiple *versions* of data in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table] (if
the table was version enabled).

{ Installing Workspace Manager

  Worskpace Manager can be installed by running → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/owminst_plb[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/owminst.plb`] as `sys`.

}

{ Workspaces

  The different versions of data are organized in *workspaces*. These workspaces usually form a tree, that is, there is one root workspace (named *LIVE*) and zero or more additional worskspaces. Each
  of this additional workspaces has exactly one parent-workspace.
  -
 (Apparently, it's possible to create workspaces with multiple parents by setting the initialization parameter `ALLOW_MULTI_PARENT_WORKSPACES` to `ON`).

  The available workspaces can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/_wmsys/workspaces[`all_wm_workspaces`].

  { Merging

    A child workspace can be merged into its parent which applies the changes in the child to its parent. After a workspace is merged, it will be deleted.

  }

}
{ Version enabled tables

  { Views

    Workspace manager creates a few → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[views] for each version enabled tables. These views have the same name as the table with the following
    suffixes appended:
    table { ll
      `_conf` ☰ 
      `_diff` ☰ 
      `_hist` ☰ Rows added by calling `setDiffVersions`
      `_lock` ☰ 
      `_mw`   ☰ `mw` = Multiworkspace view. Rows added by calling `setMultiWorkspaces`
    table }

  }
