@ Workspace Manager

With Oracle's *Workspace Manager*, its possible to store multiple *versions* of data in a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[table] (if
the table was version enabled).

{ Installing Workspace Manager

  Worskpace Manager can be installed by running → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/owminst_plb[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/owminst.plb`] as `sys`.

}

{ Workspaces

  The different versions of data are organized in *workspaces*. These workspaces form a tree, that is, there is one root workspace (named *LIVE*) and zero or more additional worskspaces. Each
  of this additional workspaces has exactly one parent-workspace.

  { Merging

    A child workspace can be merged into its parent which applies the changes in the child to its parent. After a workspace is merged, it will be deleted.
