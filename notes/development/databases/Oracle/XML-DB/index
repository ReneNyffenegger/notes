{ Check if XML DB is installed

  If XML DB is installed, there is a user named `XDB` (whose `status` should not be `INVALID`) and a view named `resource_view`:
code {
select status from dba_users where username = 'XDB';
select * from resource_view;
code }

}
{ Configuration resource: xdbconfig.xml

 `xdbconfig.xml` is an XML resource used to configure XML DB. This resource is stored in XML DB repository.

? The content of the file for the current session can be read with `dbms_xdb_config.cfg_get` and updated with `dbms_xdb_config.cfg_update`.
  -
  With respect to the *embedded PL/SQL gateway*, however, the configuration should be made with `dbms_epg`, not by directly modifying `xdbconfig.xml`.

  The structure of `xdbconfig.xml` conforms to the XSD `http://xmlns.oracle.com/xdb/xdbconfig.xsd`
