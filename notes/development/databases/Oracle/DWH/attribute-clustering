$ Oracle: attribute clustering
@ attribute clustering

An Oracle table can be defined to use attribute clustering.

One of the purposes of attribute clustering is to improve the *index clustering factor*.

Oracle attribute clustering must not be confused with *table clusters*.

{ SQL support

  Oracle may respect attribute clustering in direct path inserts, data movements and table creation statements. 

  Regular DML statements are not affected by a table's attribute clustering property.
  
}
{ Join attribute clustering

  The data is clustered based upon the values in *another* table.

}
{ Types of attribute clustering

  Two types of attribute clustering:  
   	• Linear ordering
    • Interleaved ordering
    
  Both types can be used for single table and join attribute clustering.

{ Related technologies

  Attribute clustering especially benefits when used together with
    • Exadata storage indexes
    • Oracle in memory min/max pruning
    • Zone maps
