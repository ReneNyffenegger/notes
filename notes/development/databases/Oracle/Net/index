$ Oracle Net

*Oracle Net* allows a client to connect to an → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[Oracle instance] or instance to connect among themselves.

{ Connect descriptor

  A *connect descriptor* consists of
    • the location of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/Listener that is accessed through a protocol address and
    • the service name of the database to which to connect.  

}
{ tnsnames.ora #tnsnames-ora

  The `tnsnames.ora` contains the mappings
    • from *network service names* to *connect descriptors* (local naming method)
    • from *net service names* to *listener protocol addresses*

  Oracle Net tries to find the `tnsnames.ora` in the following locations:
    • `$TNS_ADMIN/tnsnames.ora`
    • `$ORACLE_BASE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora`
    • `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/network/admin/tnsnames_ora`

  If the directory pointed at with the `$TNS_ADMIN` environment variable exists, but does contain have a `tnsnames.ora` file, the file is assumed to be missing and Oracle NET will not try to find it in other
  directories.

  On Windows, Oracle also checks for a stated location in the → Windows/registry.

  { Format of entries in `tnsnames.ora`

   `tnsnames.ora` contains one or more entries in the following format:
code {
NET_SERVICE_NAME = (
   DESCRIPTION = (
      ADDRESS=( protocol_address )
   )
   (  CONNECT_DATA = (
        SERVICE_NAME=service_name
      )
   )

   The value if `protocol_address` is used to locate and contact the listener.
   -
   After the listener was contacted, the client passes the information in `service_name` to the listener which in turn will then try to locate and contact the specified
   Oracle service
) 
code }

  }

}
