$ Oracle 12c
@ 12

{ Some (imho) interesting new features

  The maximum size of the VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2, and RAW data types has been increased from 4,000 to 32,767 bytes

  Identity columns (→ misc/ISO/9075/features[SQL feature T174])

  Row limiting clause (`fetch first`, `offset` clauses, see → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows[select first n rows/rows between n and m)]).

  Invisible columns (which are not returned with `select * from …` or shown by `describe table`). They are returned however, if the
  column is explicitely selected.

  Implicit results (`dbms_sql.return_result`)

  SQL Plan management

 `dbms_java.set_runtime_exec_credentials('DBUSER', 'osuser', 'ospass');`
  
 *SQL Translation Framework* accepts non-Oracle → development/databases/SQL[SQL statements] and translates the into the Oracle SQL derivative. The SQL translator also
  converts Oracle error messages into the other vendor specific values expected by an application.

  Tables with *valid time* support. (See → development/databases/SQL/temporal-data). Select statements now have the `as of` and `versions between` clauses.
  -
 (Transaction time was already supported in → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/11g[11g Release 1] by *Flashback Data Archive* as part of *Total Recall*).

  Define a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] function in a `with` clause.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/call_stack[`utl_call_stack`]

  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] inquiry directives `$$plsql_owner` and `$$plsql_type`. (The augment the already available `$$plsql_line` and `$$plsql_unit`).

  Maximum lenght of identifiers increased to 128 (from 30) bytes. (Requires → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init param] `compatible` to be set to `12.2.0` or higher)

  → development/databases/Oracle/Options/database-in-memory (with first patch set (`12.1.0.2`))

 `deprecate` pragma.
