{ Notes

  Famously, there was no version Oracle v1 because nobody wants a version 1.

  The *i* in 8i stands for internet, the *g* in 10g and 11 for claud and the *c* in 12c and 18c for cloud.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/db_version[`dbms_db_version`] stores the current Oracle version and release number. In
  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL, they might be used for conditional compilation.
