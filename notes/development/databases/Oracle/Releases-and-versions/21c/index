{ Blockchain tables #ora-21c-blockchain-tables

  A blockchain-→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables is an *insert-only* and *tamperproof* table.

  Block chain tables were backported to 19.10 with patch 32431413 (requires `compatible` to  be set to at least `19.10.0`).
  -
  19.11 does not require this patch.


}
{ GROUP BY #ora-21c-group-by

  { ANY_VALUE #ora-21c-any_value

    The `ANY_VALUE(…)` «→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate» evaluates to the first non-→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null[`null`] value encountered in
    a group of a select statement using the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] clause.
code {
select
   grp_1,
   grp_2,
   max(val_1),
   ANY_VALUE(val_2)
from
   tab
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by
   grp_1,
   grp_2
code }

  }
  { BIT_AND_AGG, BIT_OR_AGG, BIT_XOR_AGG  

    21c introduced the `BIT_AND_AGG`, `BIT_OR_AGG` and `BIT_XOR_AGG` aggregate functions.

  }
}
{ Aggregate functions

  { CHECKSUM #ora-21c-checksum

    The `checksum(…)` aggregate function a deterministic 8-byte value as a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/number`.
    -
    This value can be used to verify if the values of a column (per table or in a group) have changed between two executions of the
    SQL statement.

    See also the `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/sqlhash` package.

  }

}
{ Analytical functions #ora-21c-analytic

  21c improves some aspects of → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/analytic[analytic functions].

  The `window` clause allows to name `over(partition by … order by …)` definition once and then be used multiple times:
code {
select
   first_value(col) over wnd as …,
   last_value (col) over wnd as …
from
   tab
WINDOW wnd as (partition by … order by …)
code }

  Besides `rows between …` and `range between …`, there is also a `groups between`:
code {
select
   count(col) over wnd_row as cnt_row,
   count(col) over wnd_rng as cnt_rng,
   count(col) over wnd_grp as cnt_grp
from
   tab
window
   wnd_row as (order by col rows   between 1 preceding and current row),
   wnd_rng as (order by col range  between 1 preceding and current row),
   wnd_grp as (order by col groups between 1 preceding and current row)
;
code }

  The exclude clause:
code {
… over (… exclude no other   ) …
… over (… exclude current row) …
… over (… exclude group      ) …
… over (… exclude ties       ) …
code }

  { CHECKSUM

   `checksum` is a new analytical function that calculates the checksum of the input values or expressions.

  }

}
{ DBMS_XPLAN #ora-21c-dbms_xplan

  21c introduced two new, but undocumented, functions to `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan`
    • `compare_cursor`
    • `compare_xplan`

}
{ DBMS_MLE

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/mle` (mle = Multilingual Engine) allows to execute → development/languages/JavaScript.

}
{ JSON

  21c introduced a proper → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[datatype] to store JSON documents. The name of this data type happens to be `json`. 

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/json/transform` allows to modify parts of a JSON document.

  With 21c, JSON is also supported in Advanced Queuing.

}
{ Misc

  The set operator `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/set-operators/minus` is improved with the `minus all` variant, `intersect` with `intersect all`.

  → development/databases/Oracle/optimizer#ora-optimizer-features[Optimizer features]:
    • `WITH` clause filter predicate pushdown
    • Number of distinct value (NDV) modeling for real time statistics

  The minimum possible value for the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/compatible[init parameter `compatible`] on 21c is `12.2.0`.

  It's possible to use → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/_expressions[expressions to set values] for → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameters].

  21c only supports *→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/multitenant[multitenant container] databases* (CDB).
  -
  The word *database* now refers to either a CDB or a PDB.

  21c introduces *Transactional Event Queues (TEQ)*: Partitioned message queues that combine messaging, streaming, direct messages, publish/subcribe.
  -
  TEQ is an optimized implementation of AQ (previously known as AQ Sharded Queues).

  → development/databases/Oracle/sample-schemas[Sample schemas] are not installed by default anymore, they must be cloned from github.

  The → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n[Oracle Home] is set read-only.

  Oracle Wallet Manager (OWM) is deprecated.
