@ 23c

rem {

rem }

Oracle claims, that 23c has 300+ new features and enhancements compared to → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c.

{ BOOLEAN data type in SQL

  Oracle 23c introduces the `boolean` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[datatype].

code {
create table tq84_bool_test (val varchar2(10), flg boolean);
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('true'  , true );
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('false' , false);
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('null'  , null );
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('t'     ,'t'   );
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('yes'   ,'yes' );
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('true'  ,'true');
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('f'     ,'f'   );
insert into tq84_bool_test values ('0'     , 0    );

select val from tq84_bool_test where     flg;
select val from tq84_bool_test where not flg;
code }

code {
SQL> select true, false;
--
-- TRUE FALSE
-- ---- -----
-- 1    2    
code }


}
{ Selecting an expression without FROM DUAL

  The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual[`DUAL` table] is not needed anymore to select one or more expressions:
rem {
 (if `_past_dual_enabled` is set to `true`?):
rem }
code {
select
  'Hello world'     as txt,
   7 * 6            as num
   sysdate          as now;
code }

}
{ JavaScript Stored procedures

  Stored procedures can be written in → development/languages/JavaScript:
code {
create mle module tq84_js language javascript as

    export function f(p1, p2) { return p1+p2; }
   
    …

  create function f (p1 number, p2 number) return number as mle module tq84_js signature f(number, number);

  select f(20, 22) /* Ha: no more dual :-) */;
code }

}
{ DROP/CREATE TABLE IF [NOT] EXIST

  The `if [not] exist` clause auf the `create table` and `drop table` statements are useful to prevent the → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00942_table-or-view-does-not-exist and *ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object* errors:

code {
drop   table IF     EXIST tq84_t1;
create table IF NOT EXIST tq84_t2 (num number, txt varchar2(10));
code }

}
{ GROUP BY on expression aliases/position number

 `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` can use aliases for expressions (such as the result of a PL/SQL function):
code {
select
   count(*),
   fnc(a, b) xyz
from
   t
group by
   xyz
having
   xyz > 100
;
code }

  Prior to Oracle 23, the previous statement would have thrown a → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-00904_invalid-identifier error message.

  In order to group on a position *number* (rather than an expression alias), the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[init parameter]
 `group_by_position_enabled` must be set to `true`.

}
{ Updating tables

  Tables can be updated with a condition specified in a («direct») → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/join:

code {
udpate    dest d
   set    d.xxx = …
  from    src  s
 where    d.abc = s.def;
code }

}
{ JSON

  { JSON Schema

    A *JSON schema* allows to validate → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON documents:

code {
create table tq84_json_schema_test (
   obj json validate '
     {
         "num": number,
         … 
     }
   '
);
code }
  }
  { JSON Relational Duality

   *JSON Relational Duality* provides a mapping between
      • the way an application consumes and represents data (i. e. JSON documents) and
      • the paradigm in which a *relational* database stores the data (i. e. rows).

    This mapping is defined in *JSON relational duality views*.

?   The conversion is between these two worlds is triggered in/with *GraphQL*.

code {
create or replace JSON DUALITY VIEW
from tq84_root_tab                   -- The name table sitting at the top of the hierarchy
as
   tq84_rel_dual_test
   @update @insert @delete
{
   num      :   col_num,             -- Mapping between JSON property names and table column names
   txt      :   col_txt
   children : tq84_child_tab {       -- Nesting objects
     …

   }
}
code }
    { Accessing duality views

      A duality view can be accessed with
        • SQL
        • traditional → development/web/HTTP[HTTP]/→ development/web/service/REST[REST] operations: GET, PUT, POST (see *concurrent reading/writing access* below)
        • Simple Oracle Document API (SODA)
        • Oracle Database API for MongoDB
        • ORDS

    }
    { Concurrent reading/writing access

      → development/web/service/REST[REST] GET and REST PUT are stateless operations. Thus, a writing operation might overwrite the modification of another writing request («mid-air collision» problem).

      In order to avoid this problem, Oracle has adapted the concept of the *ETag* response and *If-Match* request → development/web/HTTP/header[HTTP header].

    }
    { Advantages over ORM

      Some advantages of duality views over Object Relational Mappings (ORMs) are
        • They're language independent
        • They're optimized by the database

    }
    { Describing a duality view's schema

      `dbms_json_schema.describe('tq84_rel_dual_test')`

code {
$dbHost=…
$schemaName=rene
curl -X GET http://$dbHost/ords/$schemaName/metadata-catalog/tq84_rel_dual_test
code }

    }
  }
}
{ Table value constructors

  Insert multiple records at once (going by the name of «table value constructor»):
code {
insert into t1 values
  (1, 'first record' ),
  (2, 'second record'),
  (3, 'third record' ),
  (4, 'fourth record');
code }

  Similarly in a `select` statement:
code {
select * from (
  values
    (1, 'first record' ),
    (2, 'second record'),
    (3, 'third record' ),
    (4, 'fourth record')
)
tmp (num, txt);
code }

}
{ Schema Level Privileges

  → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[Privileges] can be granted on entire schemas:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DCL/grant
   select any table
on
   schema sales  
to
   rene;
code }

}
{ SQL domains

  SQL domains can optionally specify a
    • data constraint
    • display format
    • a collation

code {
create domain email_addr as varchar2(99) …
;

create domain month_year
   constraint month_fmt check (regexp_like(year_month, '^\d\d-\d\d\d\d$')
   display 'Year: ' || substr(year_month, 4, 4) || ', Month: ' || substr(year_month, 1, 2)
   order substr(year_month, 4, 4) || substr(year_month, 1, 2)
;

create table financial_report
   …
   corrections_to email_addr
   rep_period     month_year,
   …
)
;
}

code }

  Particularities about domains can be quried with the new functions `domain_display` and `domain_order`. These get a domain's definition of display and order functions.

}
{ Developer role

  A special developer role to facilitate developers's jobs.
code {
begin
   dbms_developer_admin.grant_privs('rene');
end;
/
code }

}
{ Up to 4096 columns per table

  Up to 4096 → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] per → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables (requires `max_columns` to be set to `extended` and `compatibility` to be set to `23.0.0`).

}
{ Object and schema annotations 

  Key value pair annotations for (some) → development/databases/Oracle/objects[objects] provide metadata for data and schema.

code {
create table t_foo ( … )
annotations (
   expected_release 'R4.2',
   test_coverage    'no'
);
code }

  Annotations are supported for tables, views, materialized views, columns, indexes and domains.

}

  • Improved error messages: *ORA-00979: not a GROUP BY expression* -> *ORA-00979: "RENE.C1": does not match a GROUP BY expression*.
  • Improved `returning` clause for `merge` and `update` statements (See → https://db-oriented.com/2017/10/07/returning-into-enhancement-suggestion/[this enhancment suggestion] and → https://community.oracle.com/tech/apps-infra/discussion/4396106/returning-into-support-both-pre-update-and-post-update-values[this Oracle community discussion]).
