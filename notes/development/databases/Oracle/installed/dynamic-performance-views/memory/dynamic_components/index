Determine diff between *SGA target* and actual SGA size:
code {
select
   (select current_size from v$memory_dynamic_components where component = 'SGA Target') -
   (select sum(value)   from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga                                                     ) diff_sga_target_to_sga
from
   dual;
code }
