$ Oracle: V$MEMORY_DYNAMIC_COMPONENTS
@ v$memory_dynamic_components

`v$memory_dynamic_components` shows the current sizes of all *dynamically tuned memory components*, including the total size of the SGA and the instance PGA.

`v$memory_dynamic_components` shows exactly the same information as `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga/dynamic_componentes` except
that `v$sga_dynamic_components` does not include the two rows for `SGA Target` and `PGA Target`).
-
Both views select from `x$kmgsct`.

Determine diff between *SGA target* and actual SGA size:
code {
select
   (select current_size from v$memory_dynamic_components where component = 'SGA Target') -
   (select sum(value)   from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sga                                                     ) diff_sga_target_to_sga,
    --
   (select current_size from v$memory_dynamic_components where component = 'SGA Target') -
   (select    value     from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/parameter                 where name      = '→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/sga/target[sga_target]') diff_to_param
from
   dual;
code }
