$ Oracle: V$SGA
@ v$sga

`v$sga`: how much memory does the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA (System Global Area) use?

`select * from v$sga` is roughly the same as typing `show sga` in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus[SQL*Plus] with the exeption that the latter also shows the total.
