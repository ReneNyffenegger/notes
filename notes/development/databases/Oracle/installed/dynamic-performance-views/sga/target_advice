$ Oracle: V$SGA_TARGET_ADVICE
@ v$sga_target_advice

The purpose of `v$sga_target_advice` is to assist in deciding for a value for the init parameter The init parameter `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/sga/target`.

`v$sga_target_advice` is part of ASSM (Automatic Shared Memory Management).

This view is populated if `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/cache/advice` is set to `on` and `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/statistics_level` is `typical` (or `all`).

code {
select
   sta.sga_size                 sga_size_mb,
   sta.sga_size_factor,
   sta.estd_db_time,
   sta.estd_physical_reads,
   sta.estd_buffer_cache_size,
   sta.estd_shared_pool_size,
   sta.con_id
from
   v$sga_target_advice sta;
code }

{ TODO

  Is the value of `total_sga_mb` and `sga_size_1_mb` as returned by the following query always equal?
code {
select
   (select round(sum(value)/1024/1024) from v$sga) total_sga_mb,
   (select sga_size from v$sga_target_advice where sga_size_factor = 1) sga_size_1_mb
from
   dual;
code }

}

sa:

? The information in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/memory/target_advice` is similar to that provided by `v$sga_target_advice`.
