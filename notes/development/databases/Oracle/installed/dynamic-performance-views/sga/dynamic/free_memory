$ Oracle: V$SGA_DYNAMIC_FREE_MEMORY
@ v$sga_dynamic_free_memory

The value of `current_size` in `v$sga_dynamic_free_memory` corresponds to the amount of memory that is available to be
allocated for the SGA in future dynamic SGA resize operations.

Because this value is currently not used, it would be a waste of memory if it were allocated.
