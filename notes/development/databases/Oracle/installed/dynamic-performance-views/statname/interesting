$ Oracle Interesting SQL statistics of V$STATNAME


Some interesting statistics that are found in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/statname[`v$statname`], IMHO, include
table { ll

  `db block gets` ☰ Get a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data block] in *current mode*, that is the most recent version of it. Typically used in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML.
  `consistent gets` ☰ Get a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[data block] that is *consistent with a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction/SCN* (aka referred to as *point in time* or *read consistent* mode). Typically used in *queries* (`select` statements) to guarantee *data consistence*. A consistent get may or may not involve reconstruction of a data block.
  `session logical reads` ☰ Sum of `db block gets` plus `consistent gets`
  `consistent changes` ☰ Number of times rollback was applied to create a consistent read
  `physical reads` ☰ Number of blocks that were read from disk because they were not cachaed in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache. This value is `physical reads direct` plus the reads into the buffer cache.
  `rows processed` ☰
  `recursive calls` ☰ Records operations that are made by Oracle «behind the scenes» that are necessary to execute a query
  `sorts (memory)` ☰
  `sorts (disk)` ☰ Sort operations that required at least one disk write
  `sorts (rows)` ☰
  `redo size` ☰ Amount of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/redo-data in bytes
  `SQL*Net roundtrips to/from client` ☰
  `bytes sent via SQL*Net to client` ☰
  `bytes received via SQL*Net from client` ☰

{ Summing up values

  Some statistical values combine (sum up) values of other statistics.

  For example
    • `session logical reads` = `db block gets` + `consistent gets`
    • `physical reads` = `physical reads cache` + `physical reads direct`

  This is demonstrated with the following query where the value of the returned `session_logical_read` should be the
  same as `db_block_plus_consistent_gets` and `phys_reads` should be the same as `phys_read_cache_plus_direct`:
code {
select
   sum(case when name in ('session logical reads'     ) then value end ) session_logical_read,
   sum(case when name in ('db block gets',
                          'consistent gets'           ) then value end ) db_block_plus_consistent_gets,
   sum(case when name in ('physical reads'            ) then value end ) phys_reads,           
   sum(case when name in ('physical reads cache',      
                          'physical reads direct'     ) then value end ) phys_read_cache_plus_direct
from (
   select
      nam.name,
      sum(sst.value) value
   from
      v$sesstat  sst  join
      v$statname nam on sst.statistic# = nam.statistic#
   group by
      nam.name
)
;
code }
