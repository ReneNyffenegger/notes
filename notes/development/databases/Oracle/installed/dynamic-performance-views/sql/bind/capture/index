$ V$SQL_BIND_CAPTURE
@ v$sql_bind_capture

`v$sql_bind_capture` captures → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/bind-variables[bind variables] for all sessions and is faster than setting 10046 on level 4 (but does not necessarily overwrite captured values when an SQL
statement is resubmitted with different values).

The columns `child_address` can be joined with `address` in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/bind/data`.
