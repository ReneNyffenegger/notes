$ v$sql

`v$sql` displays statistic information for each *child version* of an SQL statement. Thus, a record in `$sql` is identified by either
  • `address` and `child_number` or
  • `sqlid` and `child_number`

Statistics are updated
  • When a SQL statement finishes with its execution
  • Every 5 seconds

With `sqlid` and `child_number`, its possible to join with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan[`v$sql_plan`] to view a particular child's
execution plan.
