$ v$sql

`v$sql` displays statistic information for each *child version* of an SQL statement. Thus, a record in `$sql` is identified by either
  • `address` and `child_number` or
  • `sqlid` and `child_number`

Statistics are updated
  • When a SQL statement finishes with its → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execution]
  • Every 5 seconds

{ Showing an SQL's execution plan

  With `sqlid` and `child_number`, its possible to display the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[SQL statement's execution plan] with
  the function → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan#dbms_xplan-display_cursor[`display_cursor`] of the package → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan[`dbms_xplan`].

  Alternatively, these two values can be join with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan[`v$sql_plan`] to view a particular child's
  execution plan.
