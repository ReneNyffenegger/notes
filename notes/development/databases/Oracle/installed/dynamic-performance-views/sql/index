$ Oracle: V$SQL
@ v$sql

`v$sql` displays statistic information for each *child version* of an → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement. Thus, a record in `v$sql` is identified by either
  • `address` and `child_number` or
  • `sqlid` and `child_number`

Statistics are updated
  • When a SQL statement finishes with its → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execution]
  • Every 5 seconds

  See also → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/diff-stats[this statement]: It gets some execution stats from a
  (preferably erunning) → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement from `v$sql` and and then gets the same performance indicators
   after an interval of time again and then reports the stats and their differences.

}
{ Showing an SQL's execution plan

  With `sqlid` and `child_number`, its possible to display the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[SQL statement's execution plan] with
  the function → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan/api/display/cursor[`display_cursor`] of the package → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan[`dbms_xplan`].

  Alternatively, these two values can be joined with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan[`v$sql_plan`] to view a particular child's
  execution plan.
