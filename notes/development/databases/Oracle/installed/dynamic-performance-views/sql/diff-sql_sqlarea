$ Oracle: Difference between v$sql and v$sql_area

→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql[`v$sql`] stores statistics about each child version of an SQL statement while
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/area[`v$sqlarea`] uses `group by` to summarize them per `sqlid` (or `address`, respectively).

The following query selects the column names that are available in either but not both of
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql[`v$sql`] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/area[`v$sqlarea`].
