$ v$sql_shared_memory

{ chunk_com, structure, function

  In many cases `chunk_com` is something like
code {
structure || case when structure is not null then ' : ' end || function
code }
  (plus minus one or two whitepsaces)

code {
select
   count(*),
   structure,
   function
from
   v$sql_shared_memory
group by
   structure,
   function
order by
   structure,
   function;
code }

}
