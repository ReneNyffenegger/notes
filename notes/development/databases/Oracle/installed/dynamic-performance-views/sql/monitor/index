$ v$sql_monitor

`v$sql_monitor` provides a subset of the performance statistics (such as elapsed and CPU time, number of IO reads and writes, wait times etc.) that are also recorded in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql[`v$sql`].
Unlike `v$sql`, which accumlates those statistics over the time that an SQL statement is in the library cache, a record in `v$sql_monitor` contains the figures of
*one* → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution[execution of an SQL statement].

{ «primary key»

  The column `key` is like a «virtual» primary key, that is, it identifies a record in `v$sql_monitor`:
code {
select
   count(*),
   count(distinct key)
from
   v$sql_monitor;
code }

}
