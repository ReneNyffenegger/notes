$ Oracle: v$metricname
@ v$metricname

`v$metricname` contains a list of metric-names, their units and ids, and an id that specifies to which metric group a metric belongs.

Some of these metrics (but apparently not all of them) can be queried from `v$metric_history` and `v$metric`. «Missing» metrics are:
code {
select metric_name from v$metricname minus
select metric_name from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/metric[v$metric];
code }
