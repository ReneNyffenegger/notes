$ v$session_wait

What is each session *currently* waiting for.

In contrast, → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/event lists the cumulative history of events waited for in a session. 

The columns `P1`, `P2` and `P3` are parameters that are dependant on the event. With Oracle 10g, v$session_wait's information will be exposed within v$session as well. 

Since 10g, Oracle displays the v$session_wait information also in the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session view.
