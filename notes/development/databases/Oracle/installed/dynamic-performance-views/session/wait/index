$ Oracle: V$SESSION_WAIT
@ v$session_wait

What is each session *currently* waiting for.

In contrast, → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/event lists the cumulative history of events waited for in a session. 

{ Columns

  The columns `P1`, `P2` and `P3` are parameters that are dependant on the event. With Oracle 10g, v$session_wait's information will be exposed within v$session as well. 

  table { ll
     `SID`                           ☰ Identifier that identifies the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[session] which waits for the event described in the record.
     `SEQ#`                          ☰ A unique number, incremented for each wait
     `EVENT`                         ☰ A textual description of the event that the session is waiting for (if in wait) or the most recent event waited for (if not in wait).
     `P1TEXT`, `P2TEXT`, `P3TEXT`    ☰ A textual description of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd parameter of the wait.
     `P1`, `P2`, `P3`                ☰ Numerical value of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd parameter.
     `P1RAW`, `P2RAW`, `P3RAW`       ☰ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[RAW]-value of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd parameter.
     `WAIT_CLASS_ID`                 ☰ Identifier of wait class (Compare with `v$session_wait_class` and `v$system_wait_class`).
     `WAIT_CLASS#`                   ☰ Identifier of wait class (Range 1 … 10)
     `WAIT_CLASS`                    ☰ Textual description of wait class
     `WAIT_TIME`                     ☰ 0: session is waiting, -1 Last wait duration was less than 1/100 of a second, -2: → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[parameter] `timed_statistics` is `false`, otherwise: duration of last wait in 1/100 of a second.
     `SECONDS_IN_WAIT`               ☰ deprecated in favor of `WAIT_TIME_MICRO` and `TIME_SINCE_LAST_WAIT_MICRO`
     `STATE`                         ☰ `WAITING`, `WAITED UNKNOWN TIME` (only if parameter `timed_statistics` is false), `WAITED SHORT TIME` (wait time less than 1/100 s), `WAITED KNOWN TIME`
     `WAIT_TIME_MICRO`               ☰ Time waited in microseconds of last wait (if not waiting) or duration of current wait (if waiting)
     `TIME_REMAINING_MICRO`          ☰ 
     `HEUR_TIME_WAITED_MICRO`        ☰ New column with Oracle 21c
     `TIME_SINCE_LAST_WAIT_MICRO`    ☰ 0: session is waiting, else time elapsed since last wait
     `CON_ID`                        ☰

    Since 10g, Oracle displays the information found in
   `v$session_wait` also in  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`].
