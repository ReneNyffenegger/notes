If → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/support[`dbms_support`] is installed, the corresponding record can also be found with
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/support#dbms_support-mysid[`dbms_support.mysid`]:
code {
select * from v$session where sid=sys.dbms_support.mysid;
code }

sa:

  The SQL script → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/sqlpath/mysid[`mysid.sql`] returns the own session's SID (intended to be stored in
  the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/sqlpath[`$SQLPATH` directory])
