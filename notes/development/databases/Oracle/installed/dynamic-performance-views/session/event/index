$ Oracle: V$SESSION_EVENT
@ v$session_event

This view is similar to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/system/event[`v$system_event`]. However, it breaks the numbers down to
currently *connected → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions]*.

{ Join with v$session

  The following SQL statement joins `v$session_event` with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] so that it is possible to
  determine what event that consumed the most time of a session:

{ Comparing connection time with waiting time and CPU time

  At any given point in time, a session is either using CPU cycles or waiting on an event. Thus, the amount of CPU time plus the amount of total waiting time is equal to the total time
  that a session is connected to Oracle.

  The following query selects these three figures. Ideally `connected_time_s` should be equal to `total_waited_time_s + total_cpu_time_s`. It turns out, however, that
  there is a small discrepancy of my idealism the the world we live in.

code {
select
  round( (sysdate - ses.logon_time ) * 86400 )   connected_time_s,
  round(  sum(time_waited_micro)     / 1e6   )   total_waited_time_s,
  round(  prc.cpu_used               / 1e6   )   total_cpu_time_s
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/[v$session]       ses                           join
   v$session_event sev on ses.sid   = sev.sid    join
   → → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/process[v$process]       prc on ses.paddr = prc.addr 
where
   sev.sid = sys_context('userenv', 'sid')
group by
   ses.logon_time,
   prc.cpu_used
;
code }

}
{ max_wait

  The maximum time waited for an event.
