$ Oracle wait event: enq: ST - contention
@ enq: ST - contention

ST stands for *Space Transaction*.

The *enq: ST – contention* event synchronizes space management operations in
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-dict-mgmt[dictionary-managed tablespaces]. Thus, the event does not occur in
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace#ora-ts-local-mgmt[locally-managed tablespace].
-
In fact, this event was one of the major reasons why locally managed tablesspaces were introduced in Oracle 8i.
