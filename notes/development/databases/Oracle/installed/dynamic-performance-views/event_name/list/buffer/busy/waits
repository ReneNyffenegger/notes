$ Oracle wait event: buffer busy waits
@ buffer busy waits

A session blocked with *buffer busy waits* is typically waiting because
  • another session waits for the same block to be read into the buffer (e. g. *file sequential read* or *db file scattered read*)
  • another session uses the same block in an incompatible way

  The *latch: cache buffer chains* event.

? The analogous wait event for *buffer busy waits* in a RAC environment are *gc buffer busy acquire* and *gc buffer busy release*.
