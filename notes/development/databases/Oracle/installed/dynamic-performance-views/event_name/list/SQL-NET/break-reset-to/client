$ Oracle wait event: SQL*Net break/reset to client
@ SQL*Net break/reset to client

When a client submits an erroneous statement to the server, the server needs to have this error acknowledged by the client.
-
While the server waits for the acknowledgment of the client, this event is *on*.

Errors that can lead to this wait event include:
  • Select from a closed cursor
  • Select on a cursor after the last row has already been fetched and no data has been returned
  • Select on a non-existent table
  • Insert a duplicate row into a uniquely indexed table
  • Issuing a query with invalid syntax

If the value of `P2` in `v$session_wait` equals 0, it means a *reset* was sent to the client.
-
A non-zero value means that a *break* was sent to the client.
