$ Oracle wait event: enq: TX - row lock contention
@ enq: TX - row lock contention

Preparation:
code {
create table tq84_tx_row_lock_contention (
   id integer primary key,
   txt varchar2(10)
);
code }

Session 1:
code {
insert into tq84_tx_row_lock_contention values (1, 'one');
insert into tq84_tx_row_lock_contention values (2, 'two');
code }

Session 2: the first staement runs OK, the second causes the session to wait on *enq: TX - row lock contention* until the first session commits or rolls back its transaction.
code {
insert into tq84_tx_row_lock_contention values (3, 'THREE');
insert into tq84_tx_row_lock_contention values (2, 'TWO'  );
code }
