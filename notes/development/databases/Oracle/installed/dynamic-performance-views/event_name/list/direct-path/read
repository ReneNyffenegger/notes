$ Oracle wait event: direct path read
@ direct path read

A *direct path read* reads a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA rather than the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache.

Direct path reads are typically used for
  • When data to be sorted does not fit into memory
  • Parallel query slaves
  • Readahead (a process issues an → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/performance-tuning/I-O request for a block it expects to need momentarily)

{ Disabling and forcing direct path reads #ora-disable-force-direct-path

  MOS Note 2426051.1 lists two ways to disable direct path reads:
    • Set → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/event/list[event] 10949 to level 1
    • Set → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters[parameter] `_serial_direct_read`

  The note also lists two ways to force direct path reads:
    • Using the `/*+ parallel */` → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/hints.
    • Setting a table's number of block statistics to a higher value than the parameter `_small_table_threshold`

  But also consider the `_direct_read_decision_statistics_driven` parameter: if its value is `true` (the default), the decision is based on optimizer statistics, if `false`, then it is based on the actual
  block count value in the segment header.

  A direct path read is performed by the → development/databases/Oracle/internals/functions[function] `kcbldrget`
