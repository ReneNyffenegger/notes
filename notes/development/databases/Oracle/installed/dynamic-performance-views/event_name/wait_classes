  Idle ☰ The → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes has nothing todo, typically because it waits for the client to send a new SQL statement to process.
  User I/O ☰ I/O for user queries, including SMON and MMON. Compare with *System I/O*.
  Cluster ☰ RAC
  Concurrency ☰ Cannot(?) be tuned - compare with *Configuration*. k
  Administrative ☰ Caused by a privileged user (
  System I/O ☰ I/O performed by background processes (like LGWR, DBWR, ARCH, RFS), excluding SMON and MMON. Compare with *User I/O*.
  Network ☰ High wait times indicate congestion or high latency in the network
  Configuration ☰ Waits whose wait time can probably be greatly reduced when Oracle is properly tuned. Compare with *Concurrency*.
  Application ☰ Waits that are caused by the application (client?) themselves (explicit locking, DDL …)jk
  Scheduler ☰ Resource manager
