{ Interesting event names

  Some interesting, IMHO, event names include:
  table { llllll
    ~Name~ ☰ ~Description~ ☰ ~param 1~ ☰ ~param 2~ ☰ ~param 3~ ☰ ~Comments~
     db file scattered read ☰ read *multiple* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[db blocks]. ☰ file number ☰ block number ☰ number of blocks ☰ The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db multiblock read*
     db file sequential read ☰ read *one* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[db block]. ☰ file number ☰ block number ☰ number of blocks (should always be 1) ☰ The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db single block read*
     db file single write ☰  ☰ file number ☰ ☰ ☰ 
     direct path read ☰  ☰ file number ☰ first dba ☰ number of blocks ☰ 
     PGA memory operation ☰ → https://fritshoogland.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/oracle-12-2-wait-event-pga-memory-operation/[Memory allocation or deallocation] ☰ number of bytes(?) ☰ ? (always 1?) ☰ ? ☰

  table }

}

{ More descriptive names #ora-event-name-more-descriptive

  As → https://tanelpoder.com/posts/oracle-wait-event-name-display-name/[Tanel Poder] points out, some event names have more descriptive names in
  the column `display_name` than in `name`. In particular, he lists:
table { ll
  ~name~ ☰ ~display_name~
  log buffer space ☰ log buffer full - LGWR bottleneck
  log file sync    ☰ commit: log file sync
  db file sequential read ☰ db single block read
  db file scattered read ☰ db mutliblock read
table }

}
{ Parameter names

  An event can have up to three parameters. The names of these parameters is exposed in the columns
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/parameter-names[`parameter1`, `parameter2` and `parameter3`].

}
{ Categorizing events by their classes

  A list of event names, categorized by their class, is → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/name_per_class[here].

}

sa:

  
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/system/event[`v$system_event`],
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/event[`v$session_event`]


  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/wait_classes
