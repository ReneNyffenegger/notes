{ Interesting event names #ora-interesting-event-names

  Some interesting, IMHO, event names include:
  table { lllll
    ~Name~ ☰ ~Description/comments~ ☰ ~param 1~ ☰ ~param 2~ ☰ ~param 3~
     db file scattered read ☰ read *multiple* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[db blocks] as part of a table or index *full scan* into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache. Because multiple blocks are read, the individual blocks must usually be «scattered» to different regions in the buffer cache,  hence, the → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db multiblock read* ☰ file number ☰ block number ☰ number of blocks
     db file sequential read ☰ read *one* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[block] into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache when reading an index block or a data block identified by a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/rowid. The database reads the blocks in a sequence, one here, one there, hence *db file sequential read*. The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db single block read* ☰ file number ☰ block number ☰ number of blocks (should always be 1)
     db file parallel read ☰ The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db list of block reads*. ☰ files ☰ blocks ☰ requests 
     db file single write ☰  ☰ file number ☰ ☰
     buffer busy waits ☰ Multiple → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes] try to access the same buffer in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache[buffer cache] ☰ ☰ ☰
     direct path read ☰ Read → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[blocks] directly into → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA. ☰ file number ☰ first dba ☰ number of blocks
     free buffer waits ☰ Waiting for free space to become available in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache to read a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block. This wait causes → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/DBWn[DBWR] to write dirty blocks to their data file. ☰ ☰ ☰
     log buffer space ☰ waiting for the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[LGWR process] to make room in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/redo-log-buffer. The more descriptive name is *log buffer full - LGWR bottleneck* ☰ ☰ ☰
     PGA memory operation ☰ → https://fritshoogland.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/oracle-12-2-wait-event-pga-memory-operation/[Memory allocation or deallocation] ☰ number of bytes(?) ☰ ? (always 1?) ☰ ?
     log file switch (checkpoint incomplete) ☰ Blocks a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[`commit`]. ☰ ☰ ☰
     log file switch (archiving needed) ☰ Blocks a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[`commit`]. ☰ ☰ ☰
     log file sync ☰ When commiting a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction, this event waits until LGWR has written the corresponding redo information to the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[redo log files]. The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *commit: log file sync*   ☰ ☰ ☰
     SQL*Net message from client ☰ ☰ driver id (the 4 integer bytes store the → development/Unicode/ASCII value of a 4-character string) ☰ number of bytes ☰ 
  table }

}

{ More descriptive names #ora-event-name-more-descriptive

  As → https://tanelpoder.com/posts/oracle-wait-event-name-display-name/[Tanel Poder] points out, some event names have more descriptive names in
  the column `display_name` than in `name`. In particular, he lists:
table { ll
  ~name~ ☰ ~display_name~
  log buffer space ☰ log buffer full - LGWR bottleneck
  log file sync    ☰ commit: log file sync
  db file sequential read ☰ db single block read
  db file scattered read ☰ db mutliblock read
table }

}
{ Parameter names

  An event can have up to three parameters. The names of these parameters is exposed in the columns
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/parameter-names[`parameter1`, `parameter2` and `parameter3`].

}
{ Categorizing events by their classes

  A list of event names, categorized by their class, is → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/name_per_class[here].

}

sa:

  
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/system/event[`v$system_event`],
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/event[`v$session_event`]

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/wait_classes

  Compare event names with statistic names found in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/statname`.
