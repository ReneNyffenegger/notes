{ Interesting event names #ora-interesting-event-names

  Some interesting, IMHO, event names include:
  table { lllll
    ~Name~ ☰ ~Description/comments~ ☰ ~param 1~ ☰ ~param 2~ ☰ ~param 3~
     db file scattered read ☰ read *multiple* (up to the value of `→ development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/db/file/multiblock_read_count`) → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[db blocks] as part of a table or index *full scan* into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache. Because multiple blocks are read, the individual blocks are «scattered» (depnding on their block address hash) to different regions in the buffer cache. The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db multiblock read* ☰ file number ☰ block number ☰ number of blocks
     db file sequential read ☰ read *one* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[block] into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache when reading an index block or a data block identified by a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/rowid. The database reads the blocks in a sequence, one here, one there (typically because of scanning an index), hence *db file sequential read*. The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db single block read* ☰ file number ☰ block number ☰ number of blocks (should always be 1). See also → https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=34559.1[MOS note 34559.1].
     db file parallel read ☰ Oracle performs (during recovery operations or buffer prefetching optimization) in parallel reads from multiple datafiles to non-contiguous buffers in memory (PGA or Buffer Cache). The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *db list of block reads*. ☰ files ☰ blocks ☰ requests 
     db file single write ☰  ☰ file number ☰ ☰
     → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/list/buffer/busy/waits ☰ Multiple → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes[processes] try to access the same buffer in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache[buffer cache]. See also → https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=34405.1[MOS note 34405.1] ☰ ☰ ☰
     → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/list/direct-path/read ☰ Read → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block[blocks] directly into → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/PGA (as opposed to reading them into the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache). See also MOS notes → https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=50415.1[50415.1], 1476089.1 and 1475655.1 ☰ file number ☰ Datbase address (dba) of first block to read ☰ number of blocks
     direct path read (lob) ☰ Special multi-block I/O's (using temporary tablespaces for sorting because memory is exhausted, parallel execution, readahead for buffer prefetching, direct load, LOB related I/O  ☰ ☰ ☰
     free buffer waits ☰ Waiting for free space to become available in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache to read a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block. This wait causes → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/DBWn[DBWR] to write dirty blocks to their data file. See also MOS Note 62172.1 ☰ ☰ ☰
     log buffer space ☰ waiting for the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/LGWR[LGWR process] to make room in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/redo-log-buffer. The more descriptive name is *log buffer full - LGWR bottleneck* ☰ ☰ ☰
     PGA memory operation ☰ → https://fritshoogland.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/oracle-12-2-wait-event-pga-memory-operation/[Memory allocation or deallocation] ☰ number of bytes(?) ☰ ? (always 1?) ☰ ?
     log file switch (checkpoint incomplete) ☰ Blocks a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[`commit`]. See also MOS Notes 34592.1 and 1376916.1 ☰ ☰ ☰
     log file switch (archiving needed) ☰ Blocks a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit[`commit`]. ☰ ☰ ☰
     → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/list/log/file/sync ☰ When commiting a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction, this event waits until LGWR has written the corresponding redo information to the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/online-redo-log-files[redo log files]. The → #ora-event-name-more-descriptive[more descriptive name] is *commit: log file sync*   ☰ ☰ ☰
     → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/list/rdbms-ipc/message ☰ ☰ timeout ☰ ☰
     SQL*Net message from client ☰ This event is expected if the client is sitting idle. In contrast, if the client is fetching a large resultset with many records, the time waited in this event might be significantly decreased by increasing the fetch size. ☰ driver id (the 4 integer bytes store the → development/Unicode/ASCII value of a 4-character string) ☰ number of bytes ☰ 
  table }

{ More descriptive names #ora-event-name-more-descriptive

  As → https://tanelpoder.com/posts/oracle-wait-event-name-display-name/[Tanel Poder] points out, some event names have more descriptive names in
  the column `display_name` than in `name`. In particular, he lists:
table { ll
  ~name~ ☰ ~display_name~
  log buffer space ☰ log buffer full - LGWR bottleneck
  log file sync    ☰ commit: log file sync
  db file sequential read ☰ db single block read
  db file scattered read ☰ db mutliblock read
table }

}
{ Parameter names

  An event can have up to three parameters. The names of these parameters is exposed in the columns
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/parameter-names[`parameter1`, `parameter2` and `parameter3`].

}
{ Categorizing events by their classes

  A list of event names, categorized by their class, is → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/event_name/name_per_class[here].
