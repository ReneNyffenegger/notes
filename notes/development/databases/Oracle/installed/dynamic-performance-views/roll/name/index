$ v$rollname

Names of rollback segments. This view's `usn` column can be joined with the field `usn` in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/roll/stat[v$rollstat`]
and with `xidusn` of → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/transaction[`v$transaction`].

Interestingly, `v$rollname` is not listed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/fixed/view_definition[`v$fixed_view_definition`]. This is probably because
`v$rollname` selects from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/undo[`undo$`] (as well as also from `x$kturd`).
