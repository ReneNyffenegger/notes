$ v$latch

Oracle collects statistics for the activity of all latches and stores these in
this view.
`gets` is the number of successful willing to wait requests for a latch.

Similarly, `misses` is how many times a process didn't successfully request a latch.

`spin_gets`: number of times a latch is obtained after spinning at least once. Sleeps indicates how many times a willing to wait process slept.

`waiters_woken` tells how often a sleeping process was »disturbed«.
