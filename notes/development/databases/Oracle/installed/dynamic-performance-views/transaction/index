$ Oracle: V$TRANSACTION
@ v$transaction

{ Join with v$session

 `v$transaction` can be joined with → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] in order to determine which
  development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[session] relates to which transaction:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dynamic-performance-views/transaction/join_session.sql||

}
{ Join with v$sqlarea

  Via `v$session`, it can further be joined to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/area[`v$sqlarea`] to select, for example,
  the SQL statement text that is currently running in a session:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dynamic-performance-views/transaction/show-transactions.sql||

}

{ Track transactions for sessions

  `v$transaction` can be used to track undo generated by a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[session].

  The following select statement shows the number of *undo blocks* and *undo records* for sessions as well as their *rollback segment name*:
code {
select
   ses.sid, 
   ses.username,
   rlb.name          "Rollback segment name", 
   trx.start_date    "TRX start date",
   trx.used_ublk     "Undo blocks",
   trx.used_urec     "Undo recs"
from
   v$session     ses                          join
   v$transaction trx on ses.taddr  = trx.addr join
   v$rollname    rlb on trx.xidusn = rlb.usn; 
code }

}
{ Transaction ID #ora-vStransaction-id

  The values of `xidusn`, `xidslot` and `xidsqn` exhibit the three components of a → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction#ora-trx-id[transaction id].
  -
  `xid` is a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[`raw`] that combines these three values:
code {
select
    xidusn   undo_segement_number,
    xidslot  slot_number,
    xidsqn   sequence_number,
    xid
from
    v$transaction;
code }

}
