$ v$enqueue_stat

If there are a lot of enqueue waits in
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/system/event or
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session/event,
`v$enqueue_stat` allows to break down those enqueues into enqueue classes.
-
For each such class, the gets, waits, failures and the cumulative sum of waited time can be found.
-
For a list of enqueue types, refer to enqueue types in x$ksqst.
-
The column cum_wait_time stems from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/fixed-views/ks/qst[x$ksqst].ksqstwtim.
