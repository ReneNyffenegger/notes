$ Oracle dynamic performance views
@ dynamic performance views

*Dynamic performance views* are views that query their data mainly from → → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables[dynamic performance (`x$`) tables].

{ Creation of the dynamic performance views

  Oracle's dynamic performance views are created by → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catalog_sql

}
{ v$ and gv$ views #gv_views

  For most dynamic performance views, two versions exist: one that starts with the prefix `v$…` and one that starts with `gv$…`. The `g` stands for *global*. These `gv$` views are relevant for
  → development/databases/Oracle/Options/real-application-clusters[RAC] environments and are used to query information for *all* → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance[instances] in the RAC network. So, they have
  an additional `inst_id`.

  In fact, the `v$` views have basically the following form
code {
create view v$XYZ as
select
   col_1,
   col_2,
   col_3,
   …
from
   gv$XYZ
where
   inst_id = → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/sys_context#sys_contect_userenv[USERENV]('Instance');
code }

}
{ v$fixed_view_definition

  The dynamic performance views and their definition can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/fixed/view_definition[`v$fixed_view_definition`].

The names of `V$` views can also be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/q/f/vi[`x$kqfvi`]:
code {
select
   kqfvinam
from
   x$kqfvi;
code }
