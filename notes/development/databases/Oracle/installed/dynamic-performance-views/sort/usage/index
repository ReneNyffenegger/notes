{ Obsolete

 `v$sort_usage` was obsoleted in Oracle 9.2 in favor of `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/tempseg_usage`.

  In fact, `V$TEMPSEG_USAGE` is a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms that points to `V_$SORT_USAGE` (which is also the view that the synonym `V$SORT_USAGE` points to):
code {
select * from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/synonyms where synonym_name = 'V$TEMPSEG_USAGE';
code }

}
