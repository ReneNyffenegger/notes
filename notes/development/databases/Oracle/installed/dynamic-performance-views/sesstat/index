$ Oracle: V$SESSTAT
@ v$sesstat

`v$sesstat` is similar to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/mystat[`v$mystat`] except except that it shows cumulated statistics for all
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions].

`v$sesstat` is also similar to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sysstat[`v$sysstat`] except that `v$sysstat` accumulates the statistics as soon as a session terminates. 

{ Join with v$statname

  In order to get a meaningful name for a recorded statistics, `v$sesstat` must be joined to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/statname[`v$statname`].

}
{ Join with v$session

 `v$sesstat` is typically joined to → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] (hence the name `v$sesstat`) to query a session's
  statistical values:

}
{ process last non-idle time, session connect time

  The units of the values of `process last non-idle time` and `session connect time` are seconds since 1970-01-01 (UTC):
code {
select
   stat.name,
   from_tz( cast( date '1970-01-01' + sest.value / 24 / 60 /60 as timestamp ), 'utc' ) at time zone sessiontimezone ts
from
   v$sesstat  sest                                         join
   v$statname stat on sest.statistic# = stat.statistic#
where
   stat.name in ('process last non-idle time', 'session connect time') and
   sest.sid = 78
;
code }
