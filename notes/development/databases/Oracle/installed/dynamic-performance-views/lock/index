$ Oracle: V$LOCK
@ v$lock

This view stores all information relating to locks (aka *enqueues*) in the database. The interesting columns in this view are `SID` (identifying the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session holding or aquiring the lock), `TYPE`, and the `LMODE`/`REQUEST` pair.

Important possible values of type are TM (DML or Table Lock), TX (Transaction), MR (Media Recovery), ST (Disk Space Transaction).

Exactly one of the lmode, request pair is either 0 or 1 while the other indicates the lock mode. If lmode is not 0 or 1, then the session has aquired the lock, while it waits to aquire the lock if request is other than 0 or 1.
The possible values for lmode and request are:
    • 1: null,
    • 2: Row Share (SS),
    • 3: Row Exclusive (SX),
    • 4: Share (S),
    • 5: Share Row Exclusive (SSX) and
    • 6: Exclusive(X) 

If the lock type is TM, the column id1 is the object's id and the name of the object can then be queried like so: select name from sys.obj$ where obj# = id1

A lock type of JI indicates that a materialized view is being refreshed.
