$ Oracle: AUDIT_ACTIONS
@ audit_actions

`audit_actions` maps an *audit number* («audit trail action type code») to the *audit name* («action type name»).

Codes 150 through 155 are for olap dml cube objects. These don't have a corresponding SQL command or octdef code.

{ TODO

code {
select * from audit_actions where name like '%LANGUAGE';
code }

 *Schema synonyms* (`CREaTE SCHEMA SYNONYM`, `DROP SCHEMA SYNONYM`) were allegedly scheduled to be added in 12g, but apparently weren't:
code {
select * from audit_actions where action in (222, 224);
code }
