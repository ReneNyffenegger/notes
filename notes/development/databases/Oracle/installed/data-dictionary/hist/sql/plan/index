{ TIMESTAMP

  The value of `timestamp` corresponds to the time when the plan was created.

  Obviously, this value is the same for a given plan, as can be verified with the following query:
code {
select
   count(distinct timestamp) dts,
-- count(*) cnt,
   sql_id,
   plan_hash_value
from
   dba_hist_sql_plan
where
   dbid = (select dbid from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/database)
group by
   sql_id,
   plan_hash_value
order by
   dts desc;
code }

}
{ Misc

  Interestingly, the value of the column `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table/columns/projection` is
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/verbs/explain/plan_table/columns/projection#ora-plan-projection-null[always `null`].

}
