$ DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY: Query begin and end of sessions 

The following query selects the begin and end of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions] that have at least one
entry in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist/active_sess_history`.

Unfortunately, it seems not possible to select to *OS user* with the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist[`DBA_HIST` views].

code {
select
   to_char(min(ash.sample_time), 'dd hh24:mi:ss')    start_,
   to_char(max(ash.sample_time),    'hh24:mi:ss')    end_,
