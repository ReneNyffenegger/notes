$ Oracle: Identify statements that were executed against tables in a given schema

This is an attempt to use Oracle's AWR to identify SQL statements that were executed against tables in a given schema.

code {
drop   table tq84_find_stmts_sql_plan purge;

create table tq84_find_stmts_sql_plan as
select
   count(*)          cnt,
   sql_id,
   dbid
from
   dba_hist_sql_plan
where
   object_owner in (â€¦)
group by
   sql_id,
   dbid;

select
   fnd.sql_id,
   txt.sql_text
from
   tq84_find_stmts_sql_plan fnd                                                       left join
   dba_hist_sqltext         txt on fnd.sql_id = txt.sql_id and fnd.dbid = txt.dbid
where
    txt.sql_text is not null
;
code }
