$ Oracle: DBA_USERS
@ dba_users

`DBA_USERS` lists all → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users in a database.

This view comes in three variants: `DBA_USERS`, `ALL_USERS` and `USER_USERS`.

{ ORACLE_MAINTAINED

  By selecting users with `where oracle_maintained='Y'`, it seems possible to find preinstalled → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[user accounts].

}

{ Possibly unused objects

  More often that I would have imagined, a database system stores abandoned objects with names like 'TMP_IMPORT_2023_04', `IMPORT_2023_OLD` etc.
  -
  The following select statement tries to identify such objects.

{ Column ACCOUNT_STATUS #dba_users-account_status

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/data-dictionary/users/account_status.sql||

  Users whose account status is `LOCKED` will get an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-28000_The-account-is-locked error message when trying to log on.

  If the status is `EXPIRED (GRACE)`, the user will receive receive an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-28002_the-password-will-expire-within-n-days warning when trying to log on.
  -
  If the status is `EXPIRED`, the user will receive an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-28001_the-password-has-expired error when trying to connect to the database.

  See also the error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-65146_account-cannot-be-unlocked-in-a-PDB-while-it-is-locked-in-the-root


}
{ Column INHERITED #dba_users-inherited

  The value of `inherited` is `YES` if the user definition was inherited from another container database and `NO` otherwise.

  As far as I can tell, there is no → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist[`dba_hist_*` view] for dropped users.
