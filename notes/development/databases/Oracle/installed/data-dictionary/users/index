$ Oracle: DBA_USERS
@ dba_users

`DBA_USERS` lists all → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users in a database.

This view comes in three variants: `DBA_USERS`, `ALL_USERS` and `USER_USERS`.

{ ORACLE_MAINTAINED

  By selecting users with `where oracle_maintained='Y'`, it seems possible to find preinstalled → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles[user accounts].

}

{ Possibly unused objects

}

{ Join with V$PWFILE_USERS

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/data-dictionary/users/joins.sql||

}
{ Column ACCOUNT_STATUS

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/data-dictionary/users/account_status.sql||

  Users whose account status is `LOCKED` will get an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-28000_The-account-is-locked error message when trying to log on.

  If the status is `EXPIRED (GRACE)`, the user will receive receive an → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-28002_the-password-will-expire-within-n-days warning when trying to log on.

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/users/with_defpwd[`dba_users_with_defpwd`]

  As far as I can tell, there is no → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist[`dba_hist_*` view] for dropped users.
