$ Oracle: Creating a Graphviz file showing object dependencies

The following SQL statement queries `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/dependencies` and creates a → tools/Graphviz[Graphviz/dot] file that depects some dependencies among
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects[database objects].
