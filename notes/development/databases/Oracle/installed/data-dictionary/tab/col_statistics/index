$ Oracle: DBA_TAB_COL_STATISTICS
@ dba_tab_col_statistics


This view comes in all four «versions»: `dba_tab_col_statistics`, `all_tab_col_statistics`, `user_tab_col_statistics` and `cdb_tab_col_statistics`.

→ development/databases/Oracle/optimizer/statistics[Statistics] and histogram information are extracted from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/columns[`xxx_TAB_COLUMNS`]
and therefore, most of the information that is found in `dba_tab_col_statistics` is also found in `dba_tab_columns`.
It appears that the only information that is only found in `dba_tab_col_statistics` is `notes` and `scope`.
