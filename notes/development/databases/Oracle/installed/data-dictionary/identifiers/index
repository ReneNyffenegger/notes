$ Oracle: DBA_IDENTIFIERS

`dba_identifiers` lists all identifiers that are found in PL/SQL code. This → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary view comes in all four variants:
`user_identifiers`, `all_identifiers`, `dba_identifiers` and `cdb_identifiers`.

In order for this view to be populated with the information about identifiers, the PL/SQL compilation parameter `psscope_settings` must be set to
`identifiers:all`.

`dba_identifiers` only stores information about basic type names (`variable`). To determine the exact type of a `variable`, the information from
`usage_context_id` must be used.

code {
select
   --
   -- Identification of the identifier being described
   --
   idt.signature,
   idt.owner,
   idt.name,
   idt.type,
   --
   -- Identification of the PL/SQL object and location where
   -- the identifier being described in the current record
   -- is found:
   --
   idt.object_name,
   idt.object_type,
   idt.line,
   idt.col,
   --
   --
   --
   idt.usage,
   idt.usage_context_id,
   idt.usage_id,

{ USAGE_ID  USAGE_CONTEXT_ID

 `usage_id` specifes a «scope». Records in `dba_identifiers` that belong to that scope have a `context_usage_id` whose value corresponds to the `usage_id` of that scope.

  The combination of `usage_id` and `usage_context_id` is unique within an object, the following statement returns
  no records:

code {
select
   count(*),
   owner,
   object_name,
   object_type,
   usage_id,
   usage_context_id
from
   dba_identifiers
group by
   owner,
   object_name,
   object_type,
   usage_id,
   usage_context_id
having
   count(*) > 1;

code }


  { Hierarchical query

    The following → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/hierarchical-queries/common-table-expressions[hierarchical query] starts at the top of a package (`usage_context_id = 0`) and recursively finds
    records (`idt.*`) that belong to this `usage_context_id` (`idt.usage_context_id = rec.usage_id`).

code {
with rec (
    usage_id,
    name,
    type,
    usage,
    owner,
    object_name,
    line,
    col,
    lvl
)
as (
   select
      usage_id,
      name,
      usage,      
      type,
      owner,
      object_name,
      line,
      col,
      0
   from
      dba_identifiers
   where
      owner            = 'SYS'           and
      object_name      = 'STANDARD'      and
      usage_context_id =  0 -- No «scope» has value 0, selects «global» records
UNION ALL
   select
      idt.usage_id,
      idt.name,
      idt.usage,
      idt.type,
      idt.owner,
      idt.object_name,
      idt.line,
      idt.col,
      rec.lvl + 1
   from
      rec                                                  join
      dba_identifiers idt on
          idt.owner            = rec.owner           and
          idt.object_name      = rec.object_name     and
          idt.usage_context_id = rec.usage_id
)
