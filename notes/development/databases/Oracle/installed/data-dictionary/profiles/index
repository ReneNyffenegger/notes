$ Oracle: DBA_PROFILES
@ dba_profiles

Each → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users[user] is assigned a → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/profile which defines some usage limits on
database resources and some constraints related to passwords.

If the value of `LIMIT` is `DEFAULT`, the actual value can be queried also from `dba_profiles` where the profile name is `DEFAULT`.

The following (→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/pivot[pivot query]) selects the users's currently assigned profile and the values of each profile:
