$ Oracle: Show columns of indices

The → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary[data dictionary] view
→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/ind/columns[`dba_ind_columns`] allows to query the
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] that participate in a given
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[index].


{ Select column names in their own column

  The following approach selects each column name of a index, up to a maximum of 10 columns, in its own column. Additionally, it also displays the column's
  nullability (colums `n_*`) and an index's uniquness:

{ Concatenate column names with commas #dba_ind_columns-listagg

  Using → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/aggregate/listagg[`listagg`], the column names of the index can be concatened with separating commas between them:
code {
select
   ico.table_name,
   ico.index_name,
   listagg(ico.column_name, ', ') within group (order by ico.column_position) index_columns
from
   dba_ind_columns ico
where
   ico.index_owner= user     -- and
-- ico.table_name = '??'
group by
   ico.table_name,
   ico.index_name
order by
   ico.table_name,
   ico.index_name; 
code }

}
