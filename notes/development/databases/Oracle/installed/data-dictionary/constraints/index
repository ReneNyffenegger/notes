$ DBA_CONSTRAINtS
@ dba_constraints

`dba_constraints` lists all → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints[constraints]; the view comes in all four variants: `user_constraints`, `all_constraints`, `dba_constraints` and `cdb_constraints`.

{ Column GENERATED

  The value of `GENERATED` is either `USER NAME` or `GENERATED NAME` and indicates whether the *name* of the constraints was provided when the constraint was created.

  If the value is `GENERATED NAME`, the constraint name is determined by Oracle and starts with `SYS_`.

}
{ Find primary-foreign key relations #ora-all_constraints-fk-pk

  By joining records of `all_constraints` that identify
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary keys] to
  records of `all_constraints` that identify → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys], it is possible to
  select primary-foreign key relations.

code {
select
   pk.owner         pk_owner,
   pk.table_name    pk_table,
   fk.owner         fk_owner,
   fk.table_name    fk_table,  
   pk.status        pk_status,
   fk.status        fk_status
from
   all_constraints  pk                                                     join
   all_constraints  fk on pk.owner           = fk.r_owner            and
                          pk.constraint_name = fk.r_constraint_name
where
   pk.owner      =  user                 and
   pk.table_name = 'XYZ';
