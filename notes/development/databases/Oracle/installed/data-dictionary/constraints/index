{ Find primary-foreign key relations #ora-all_constraints-fk-pk

  By joining records of `all_constraints` that identify
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary keys] to
  records of `all_constraints` that identify → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys], it is possible to
  select primary-foreign key relations.

   pk.owner         pk_owner,

   fk.owner         fk_owner,
   fk.table_name    fk_table,
