$ Oracle: SQL statement to find primary-foreign key relations

  By joining records of → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints[`all_constraints`] that identify
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary keys] to
  records of `all_constraints` that identify → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys], it is possible to
  select primary-foreign key relations.

code {
select
   pk.owner         pk_owner,
   pk.table_name    pk_table,
   fk.owner         fk_owner,
   fk.table_name    fk_table,  
   pk.status        pk_status,
   fk.status        fk_status
from
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/constraints[all_constraints]  pk                                                     join
