roles) these roles are granted.

`dba_role_privs` also comes in the variant `user_role_privs`.

code {
select
   rpr.granted_role,
   rpr.grantee,
   rpr.admin_option,
   rpr.common,
   rpr.default_role,     -- YES indicates that the role belongs to a → development/databases/Oracle/security/roles/default[user's set of default roles]

{ Querying role hierarchy

  The following select statement hierarchically queries the (direct and indirect) roles granted to a user (here: `USR_HIR`):
code {
with role_hierarchy (usrrol, lvl) as (
   select 'USR_HIR'    , 0     from dual union all
   select  granted_role, lvl+1 from role_hierarchy h join dba_role_privs p on p.grantee = h.usrrol
)
search depth first by usrrol set ord
select
   lpad(' ', rh.lvl*2) || usrrol
from
   role_hierarchy rh;
code }

}
{ Find the roles via which a user is granted a given privilege

code {
with role_hierarchy (usrrol, usrrol_concat) as (
   select 'USR_HIR_1'  , 'USR_HIR_1'                              from dual                                                           union all
   select  granted_role,  usrrol_concat || ' -> ' || granted_role from role_hierarchy h join dba_role_privs p on p.grantee = h.usrrol
)
select
   rh.usrrol_concat
from
   role_hierarchy  rh                             join
--
-- Alternatively, join with dba_tab_privs:
--
   dba_sys_privs   pr on rh.usrrol = pr.grantee
where
   pr.privilege = 'CREATE TABLE';
code }
