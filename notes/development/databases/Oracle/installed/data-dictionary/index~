$ Oracle data dictionary
@ data dictionary

The *data dictionary* stores information about → development/databases/Oracle/objects[database objects].

The data dictionary is also referred to as *row cache* because it stores data as rows rather than → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/database-buffer-cache[buffers].

Oracle's data dictionary is created by → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/catalog_sql

→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/background/SMON cleans up the data dictionary when it is in a transient and inconsistent state.

{ Views of the data dictionary

  Views that expose the data of the data dictionary are:
