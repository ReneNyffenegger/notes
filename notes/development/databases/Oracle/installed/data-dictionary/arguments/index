@ dba_arguments

`dba_arguments` displays functions's and procedures's argument names and types.

This view comes in the three variations `dba_arguments`, `all_arguments` and `user_arguments`.

{ Extracting the definition of a package

  This example demonstrates how `dba_arguments` can be joined to `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/procedures` to query a PL/SQL package's functions and procedures and their arguments.

  { PL/SQL Package

    We create a test package: the specificiation …
    gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/data-dictionary/arguments/extract/package.sql||
  
    … and its body:
    gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/data-dictionary/arguments/extract/package-body.sql||
  
  }
  { Query

    The following query shows the the package's procedures and functions and their arguments:
    gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/data-dictionary/arguments/extract/query.sql||

  }

}
sa:

  Details about procedures and functions are found in `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/procedures`

  Use the column `type_name` to join `dba_arguments` to
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/plsql/types[`dba_plsql_types`],
     `dba_plsql_type_attrs` and 
    → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/plsql/coll_types[`dba_plsql_coll_types`].
