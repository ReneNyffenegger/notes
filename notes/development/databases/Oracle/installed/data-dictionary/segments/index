   seg.segment_name,
   seg.segment_type,
   round(seg.bytes    / 1024/1024, 1) mb,
   round(seg.max_size / 1024/1024, 1) max_size_mb, 
   seg.extents,
   seg.partition_name,

from
   dba_segments seg
where
   seg.owner = 'RENE'
order by

   seg.tablespace_name
;
code }

{ TODO

 `user_segments` does not have the columns `header_file` and `header_block`. These two numbers identify the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/header.
