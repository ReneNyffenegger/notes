$ Oracle: DBA_SEGMENTS

`dba_segments` comes in the three variants `user_segments`, `dba_segments` and `cdb_segments`.

`dba_segments` records storaged. allocated for → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment[segments]

List a user's segment in descending order of their sizes:
code {
select
   seg.tablespace_name,
   seg.segment_name,
   seg.segment_type,
   round(seg.bytes    / 1024/1024, 1) mb,
   round(seg.max_size / 1024/1024, 1) max_size_mb, 
   seg.extents,
   seg.partition_name,
   seg.segment_subtype                              -- ASSM, MSSM, SECUREFILE or → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/null, compare with segment_space_management in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tablespaces
from
   dba_segments seg
where
   seg.owner = 'RENE'
order by
   seg.bytes           desc,
   seg.tablespace_name
;
code }

{ TODO

 `user_segments` does not have the columns `header_file` and `header_block`. These two numbers identify the
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/data-block of the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/segment/header.

  There is a segment with `segment_type = 'SYSTEM STATISTICS` and `segment_name = 'HEATMAP'`.

}

sa:

 `dba_segments` is used in → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace/free-space[this query] to calculate available and free space in
  → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/logical-structures/tablespace[tablespaces].
