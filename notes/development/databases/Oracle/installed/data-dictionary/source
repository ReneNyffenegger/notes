$ Oracle: DBA_SOURCE

`DBA_SOURCE` is a → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary view which allows to query the source code of
→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL objects.

`DBA_SOURCE` comes in four variants: `USER_SOURCE`, `ALL_SOURCE`, `DBA_SOURCE` and `CDB_SOURCE`.

{ Select source-code of a given PL/SQL package, procedure or function

}
{ Search for source code text lines with a given text

  The following example searches for a source lines that match a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/regular_expressions[regular expression] (`regexp_like`):

code {
select
   owner,
   src.name,
   src.line,
   src.text,
   src.type
from
   dba_source src
where
   src.owner not in (select username from dba_users where oracle_maintained = 'Y') and
   regexp_like(src.text, 'create.*table', 'i')
order by
   src.owner,
   src.name,
   src.type;
code }

  { Search for N lines before and M lines after matched source code line

    The previous select statement finds exactly those source code lines that match a regular expression. Oftentimes, I find this not really satisfactory because I'd like to see
    a matched line's preceeding M and following N lines.
    -
    This is possible with analytic functions, but it somewhat blows up the size of the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement:
code {
with find_matches as (
   select
      owner, name, line, text, type,
      case when regexp_like(text,
      ----------------------------------
      -- Regexp to search for goes here:
      --
        'return clob', 'i'
      --
      ----------------------------------
      ) then 1 end match
   from
      dba_source
   where
      owner not in (select username from dba_users where oracle_maintained = 'Y')
),
partitions as (
   select
      owner, name, line, text, type, match,
      sum(match) over(partition by owner, name, type order by line  asc) partition_match_asc,
      sum(match) over(partition by owner, name, type order by line desc) partition_match_desc
   from
      find_matches
),
row_numbers as (
   select
      owner, name, line, text, type, match,
      row_number() over (partition by owner, name, type, partition_match_asc  order by line  asc ) rn_asc,
      row_number() over (partition by owner, name, type, partition_match_desc order by line  desc) rn_desc,
      partition_match_asc,
      partition_match_desc
   from
      partitions
)
select
   case when match = 1 then '*' end match,
   owner, name, line, text, type
-- rn_asc, rn_desc
from
   row_numbers
where
   (partition_match_asc  is not null and rn_asc  <= 3) or -- Preceeding n lines
   (partition_match_desc is not null and rn_desc <= 4)    -- Following  m lines
order by
   owner, name, type, line;
code }

  }

}

  The names of functions and procedures found in PL/SQL packages and types can be selected from
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/procedures[`dba_procedures`].

  Errors in source code is recorded in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/errors[`dba_errors` etc].

 `dba_source` does not store the source of → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] or → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[views].
  -
  → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[Column-]names of tables and views can be queried from
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tab/columns[`dba_tab_columns`].
  -
  Alternatively, the defintion of tables can be queried using the package → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata[`dbms_metadata`].
  -
  The select statement of a view can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/views[`dba_views`].

  Information about identifiers in → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL source code can be queried from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/identifiers[`dba_identifiers`]

  The error message → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-06512_at-line reveals object, line and position of the statement in the PL/SQL source where an → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/exception[exception] was thrown.
