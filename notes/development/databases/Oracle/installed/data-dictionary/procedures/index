$ Oracle: ALL_PROCEDURES

Lists all procedures and functions (including those that are found in → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/package[PL/SQL packages], PL/SQL types and
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/triggers[triggers]).

This view comes in all four variants:
  • `dba_procedures`,
  • `all_procedures`,
  • `user_procedures` and
  • `cdb_procedures`

{ OBJECT_NAME, PROCEDURE_NAME

  Names of global stored procedures and functions (that are not defined in a PL/SQL package) are recorded in `object_name`.

  Names of stored procedures and functions that are defined in a PL/SQL package are recorded in `procedure_name`. In this case, `object_name` is the name
  of the PL/SQL package.

}

  A procedure's or function's argument names and types are listed in → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/arguments[`dba_arguments`].
