$ WRH$_SQLTEXT
@ wrh$_sqltext

The column `snap_id` stores the last snapshot id and is used for purging (see procedure `dbms_workload_repository.purge_sql_details`).

The column `ref_count` is not used anymore to reduce contention. Instead, the ref count is tracked in `wri$_sqltext_refcount`.
-
(Ref counting is used by clients such as *SQL Tuning Sets* and *Automatic SQL Tuning*.)

The → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/constraints/primary-key columns are `dbid,sql_id,con_dbid,snap_id`.
