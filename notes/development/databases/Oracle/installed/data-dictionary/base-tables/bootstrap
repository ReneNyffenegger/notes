$ Oracle: BOOTSTRAP$
@ bootstrap$

`bootstrap$` contains the DDL statements to create other bootstrap tables.

The text in `sql_text` in the table `bootstrap$` corresponds to the first SQL statements found
in the → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/sql_bsq[`sql.bsq`] script (which
is executed as part of a database creation).

Accordingly, the last statement recorded in `bootstrap$` is the
`CREATE TABLE BOOTSTRAP$ …`:

? The statements recorded in `bootstrap$` are also executed when → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/startup-shutdown starting[up an instance] between the *mount* and *open* stage.
