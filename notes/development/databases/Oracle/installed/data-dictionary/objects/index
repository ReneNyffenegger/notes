$ Oracle: DBA_OBJECTS
@ dba_objects

This view comes in all four variants: `DBA_OBJECTS`, `ALL_OBJECTS`, `USER_OBJECTS` and `CDB_OBJECT`.

{ Joins

  The following select statement joins `DBA_OBJECTS` with some specialized → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary views for some
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects[objects], such as
 → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tables[`dba_tables`], → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/views[`dba_views`] etc.

}
{ Object types

  A fast, but possibly inaccurate way to show → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Oracle object types], is to select distinct `OBJECT_TYPE` from `DBA_OBJECT`.
