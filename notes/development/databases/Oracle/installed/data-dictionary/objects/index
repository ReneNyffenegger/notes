  The following select statement joins `DBA_OBJECTS` with some specialized → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary views for some

 → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/tables[`dba_tables`], → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/views[`dba_views`] etc.

}
{ Object types

  A fast, but possibly inaccurate way to show → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Oracle object types], is to select distinct `OBJECT_TYPE` from `DBA_OBJECT`.

  `obj` is a → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/_synonyms[special synonym] for `user_objects`.
