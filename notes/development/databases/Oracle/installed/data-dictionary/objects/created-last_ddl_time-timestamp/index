$ Oracle: DBA_OBJECTS - Columns CREATED, LAST_DDL_TIME and TIMESTAMP

→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/objects[`dba_objects`] has three
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/columns[columns] that store date-related information:
table { lll
 ~Name~ ☰ ~→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[Data type]~☰ ~Comment~
  `created` ☰ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date ☰ Corresponds to the point in time when the corresponding → development/databases/Oracle/objects was created.
  `last_ddl_time` ☰ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date ☰ Last modification (→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DDL[DDL statement]) of the object or dependent objects. This includes grants and revokes
  `timestamp` ☰ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2 ☰ Last modification of the *structure* (specification) of the object. In the case of a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/views, the structure is considered changed if the number, data types, names (or order of columns?) of the returned columns change.
table }


The → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types[datatype] of `created` and `last_ddl_time` is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/date[`date`], the datatype of
`timestamp` is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2[`varchar2`] (!) in the format `YYYY-MM-DD:HH24:MI:SS`.


code {
select
   obj.object_name,
   obj.subobject_name,
   obj.object_type,
   obj.created,
   obj.last_ddl_time,
   to_date(obj.timestamp, 'YYYY-MM-DD:HH24:MI:SS') timestamp_,
   obj.status
from
   user_objects obj
where
-- obj.object_name     like '%FOOBAR%'     and
   obj.object_name not like 'TQ84%'        and
   obj.object_name not like 'ERR$%'        and
   obj.object_type not in ('INDEX', 'LOB')
order by
   obj.timestamp desc;
code }

{ CREATED <= TIMESTAMP <= LAST_DDL_TIME

  In most cases, `created <= timstamp` and `timstamp <= last_ddl_time`, although there are some exceptions, especially in the `SYS`, `SYSTEM`, `XDB`, `WMSYS` and `GSMADMIN_INTERNAL` schemas:
code {
select
   count(*),
   owner,
   object_type
from
    dba_objects
where
   to_date(timestamp, 'yyyy-mm-dd:hh24:mi:ss') not between created and last_ddl_time
group by
   owner,
   object_type
order by
   owner,
   object_type;
code }

}
