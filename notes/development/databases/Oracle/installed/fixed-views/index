$ Oracle fixed objects (x$…)
@ fixed objects

*Dynamic performance tables* (whose names start with `x$`) and their → development/databases/Oracle/objects/indexes[indexes] are commonly referred to as *fixed objects*

These objects are *fixed* because no → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statement] is allowed on these - only → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select[select statements].

Table names and their respective column names can be queried with the following SQL statement:
code {
select
   x$kqfta.kqftanam   table_name,
   x$kqfco.kqfconam   column_name
from
   x$kqfta   left join
   x$kqfco             on x$kqfta.kqftaobj  = x$kqfco.kqfcotob
order by
   x$kqfta.kqftanam,
   x$kqfco.indx;
code }
