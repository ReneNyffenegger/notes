$ Oracle: DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR

`dbms_lob.substr` returns a substring of a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[`clob`]  as a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/varchar2`.
-
For a `blob`, it returns the specified bytes as a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw`.

*Note*: Unlike in the SQL function `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/text/substr`, the number of characters (or bytes) to be removed is the second (not the third),
the offset is the third (not the second) parameter:
code {
dbms_lob.substr (
   lob_locater,
   amount,
   offset
)
code }
