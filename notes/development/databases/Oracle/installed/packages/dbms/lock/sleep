sa:

 `dbms_lock.sleep` is deprecated in favor of → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/session/api/sleep[`dbms_session.sleep`] (see also → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lock/PLS-00201_identifier-DBMS_LOCK-must-be-declared)

  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lock[`dbms_lock`]

  The → development/databases/SQL-Server#from-oracle-to-sql-server[SQL Server equivalent] of `dbms_lock.sleep` is *roughly* `→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/waitfor/delay`.
