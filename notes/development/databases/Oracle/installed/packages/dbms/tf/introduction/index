$ dbms_tf: introduction

{ Most simple example

  The following example is quite possibly the most simple example for a polymorphic table function using → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/tf[`dbms_tf`]. Because of its simplicity,
  it also does not do anything useful.

  This example also demonstrates that the package's `describe` function is called once per passed table. That is, the second invocation of
 `select * from polymorphic_intro.pass_table_on(table_ptf);` does not call `describe` anymore, as is shown by the output of the
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output[dbms_output].put_line`.
