$ Oracle: DBMS_METADATA_DIFF
@ dbms_metadata_diff

`dbms_metadata_diff` exposes the functionality to compare *metadata documents in SXML format*.

{ Simple example

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/metadata_diff/diff_two_tables.sql||

  When executed, this example prints
code {
ALTER TABLE "RENE"."TQ84_DIFF_A" MODIFY ("B" VARCHAR2(12 CHAR))
  ALTER TABLE "RENE"."TQ84_DIFF_A" DROP PRIMARY KEY
  ALTER TABLE "RENE"."TQ84_DIFF_A" ADD  PRIMARY KEY ("A","C") USING INDEX PCTFREE 10
 INITRANS 2 ENABLE
  ALTER TABLE "RENE"."TQ84_DIFF_A" RENAME TO "TQ84_DIFF_B"
code }

}
{ SXML #dbms_metadata_diff-SXML

  SXML is an → development/XML format to describe metadata of → development/databases/Oracle/objects[Oracle objects]. The structure of SXML corresponds to the SQL clauses
  with which the objects were created.

  SXML was specifically designed for object editioning and comparison purposes.
  
  SXML it is different from the XML that is returned by
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata/api/get/xml[`dbms_metadata.get_xml`] (The value returned by `get_xml` is more complex).
  
  In order to convert between XML and SXML or from SXML to a DDL statement, a transformation must be enabled with
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/metadata/api/add_transform[`dbms_metadata.add_transform`].
