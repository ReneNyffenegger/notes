$ dbms_support

`dbms_support` needs to be installed manually with → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/dbmssupp_sql[`dbmssupp.sql`] (which is found
in the → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin[`$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin`] directory).
-
After installing `dbms_support`, only → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users/oracle-maintained/sys has access to it. In order for other users to be able to use it, they need to be granted access:
code {
grant execute on dbms_support to rene;
code }

{ mysid #dbms_support-mysid

 `dbms_support.mysid` returns the session id of the session executing this function. Thus, it allows to find the record in
  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/session[`v$session`] that reveals the information about
  the current session:
code {
select * from v$session where sid=sys.dbms_support.mysid;
code ]
