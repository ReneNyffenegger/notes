$ Oracle: DBMS_SQLHASH
@ dbms_sqlhash

`dbms_sqlhash` has one function: `gethash` which returns the hashed value of an SQL result and thus allows to ensure data integrity or
compare result sets over time or across databases.

Execution must be granted to roles and/or users that want to execute `dbms_sqlhash.gethash`:
code {
connect / as sysdba;
grant execute on dbms_sqlhash to rene;
code }


The return value depends not only on the data of the result set but also on the order in which they are selected:
code {
create table tq84_sqlhash_test (num number, txt varchar2(20));

insert into tq84_sqlhash_test values (1, 'one');
insert into tq84_sqlhash_test values (2, 'two');
insert into tq84_sqlhash_test values (3, 'three');

commit;

   sys.dbms_sqlhash.gethash(
      sqltext     => 'select * from tq84_sqlhash_test order by num asc',
      digest_type =>  2

   sys.dbms_sqlhash.gethash(
