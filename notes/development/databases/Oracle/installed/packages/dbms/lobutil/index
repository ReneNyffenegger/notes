$ Oracle: DBMS_LOBUTIL
@ dbms_lobutil

`dbms_lobutil` contains diagnostic and utility functions for 11g → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/lob[LOBs].

The API that is exposed through `dbms_lobutil`, or its underlying data structures, are subject to possibly backwards-incompatible changes.

The diagnostic API offered in `dbms_lobutil` are provided separatly from → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/lob[`dbms_lob`]  to avoid
clutter. 

Because this diagnostic API is intended for (Oracle-) internal developers, QA and DDR, Oracle does not seem to document this API for
end-users
