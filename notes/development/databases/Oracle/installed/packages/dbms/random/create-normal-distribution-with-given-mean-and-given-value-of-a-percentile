$ Oracle: Create a normal distribution with a given mean and a given value of a percentile

Create a normal distribution with a given mean and a given probability that a value is less than another given value:
code {
exec dbms_random.seed(2808)

create table tq84_normal as
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[with] param as (
   select
      3.09023  zScore, --   0.1 % -- https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/ztest/zscorecalculator.aspx / Calculate z from p
--    1.28155  zScore, --  10.0 %
--    0.67449  zScore, --  25.0 %
      5000     mean,
      10       x
   from
      → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual
)
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/random/api/normal * (param.x - param.mean) / param.zScore + param.mean    val
from
   param, dual
connect by
   level <= 1000000;
code }

Verify created data:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/math/round-trunc-floor-ceil[round](avg(val), 1)   mean,
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to/char(100 * count(case when val <= 10 then 1 end) / count(*), '90.00') || ' %' pct
from
   tq84_normal;
--
--       MEAN PCT     
-- ---------- --------
--     5000.7   0.10 %
code }

Cleaning up
code {
drop   table tq84_normal;
code }
