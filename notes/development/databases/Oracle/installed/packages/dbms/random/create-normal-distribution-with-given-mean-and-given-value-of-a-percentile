$ Oracle: Create a normal distribution with a given mean and k-th percentile value

This note is intended to demonstrate how a normal distribution with a given mean (here: 5000) and a given
→ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile[k-th percentile] value (here k=0.1 % and value = 10) can be created in Oracle using `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/random/api/normal`.

For this purpose, we need to somehow obtain the → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score[z-Score] for `k`, for example with
→ https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/ztest/zscorecalculator.aspx[this calculator]. It turns out, the sought value is *3.09023*.

With these three values (z-Score, mean and k-th percentile value 10 (`x`), we create a table with one million records whose values for `val` follow this distribution:
code {
exec dbms_random.seed(2808)

create table tq84_normal as
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/clauses/with[with] param as (
   select
      3.09023  zScore, --   0.1 % -- https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/ztest/zscorecalculator.aspx / Calculate z from p
--    1.28155  zScore, --  10.0 %
--    0.67449  zScore, --  25.0 %
      5000     mean,
      10       x
   from
      → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual
)
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/
   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/random/api/normal * (param.x - param.mean) / param.zScore + param.mean    val
from
   param, dual
connect by
   level <= 1000000;
code }

After creating the table, we check if the result corresponds to our criteria. It turns out that the mean *is* approximately 5000 and that indeed 0.1 % of `val` is smaller or equal to 10:
code {
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/math/round-trunc-floor-ceil[round](avg(val), 1)   mean,
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/type-conversion/to/char(100 * count(case when val <= 10 then 1 end) / count(*), '90.00') || ' %' pct
from
   tq84_normal;
--
--       MEAN PCT     
-- ---------- --------
--     5000.7   0.10 %
code }

Cleaning up
code {
drop   table tq84_normal;
code }
