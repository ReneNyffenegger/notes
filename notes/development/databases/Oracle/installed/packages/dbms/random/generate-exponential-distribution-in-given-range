$ Oracle: Generate an exponential distribution in a given range

The following select statement creates a random variable that follows an
→ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution[exponential distribution] in the range 0 … 254 and
a lambda of 0.01:
code {
with p as (
   select
       0    min_,
     255    max_,
       0.01 lambda
   from
      dual
)
select
   -(1/lambda)*ln(exp(-lambda*min_) - dbms_random.value * ( exp(-lambda*min_) - exp(-lambda*max_) ))
from
   p;
code }

Create a table with 100000 records where the formula is applied with a random number generator
(`→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/random[dbms_random].value`) and by dividing 100000 by the
record number (`(level-1)/100000`):
code {
create table tq84_exp_distr as
with p as (
   select
       0    min_,
     255    max_,
       0.01 lambda
   from
      dual
)
select
   -(1/lambda)*ln(exp(-lambda*min_) - (level-1)/100000  * ( exp(-lambda*min_) - exp(-lambda*max_) )) r,
   -(1/lambda)*ln(exp(-lambda*min_) - dbms_random.value * ( exp(-lambda*min_) - exp(-lambda*max_) )) s
from
   p connect by level <= 100000;
code }

Count the occurences of each `cnt`:
code {
with r as (
  select
     trunc(r) r,
     count(*) cnt
  from
     tq84_exp_distr
  group by
     trunc(r)
),
s as (
  select
     trunc(s) s,
     count(*) cnt
  from
     tq84_exp_distr
  group by
     trunc(s)
)
select
   nvl(r, s)  x,
   r.cnt      cnt_r,
   s.cnt      cnt_s
from
   r                                 full outer join
   s on r.r = s.s
order by
   nvl(r, s);
code }
