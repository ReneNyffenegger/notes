$ Oracle: DBMS_SCHEDULER - CREATE_JOB
@ create_job

`dbms_scheduler.create_job` creates a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/jobs.

`create_job` is overloaded so that it accommodates for different scenarios:
  • Without an existing → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs or → development/databases/Oracle/objects/schedules.
  • Using an existing → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs and → development/databases/Oracle/objects/schedules.
  • Using an existing → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs and an *inline* schedule.
  • Using an *inlined* → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs and an existing schedule.
  • Using an *inlined* → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs and an *event*.
  • Using an existing → development/databases/Oracle/objects/programs and an *event*.
