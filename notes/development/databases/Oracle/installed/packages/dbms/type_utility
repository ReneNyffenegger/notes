$ dbms_type_utility

A comment in `â†’ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin[$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin]/dbmstypu.sql` reads:
"
  I am removing all procedure from the package as they are no longer
  in use and they have too many security holes to leave around. Keeping
  the package for possible future use. 
"

Accordingly to the comment, the specification of the package is:
code {
create or replace package dbms_type_utility as 
       procedure none;
end dbms_type_utility;
/
code }
