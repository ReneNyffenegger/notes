$ Oracle: DBMS_ERRLOG
@ dbms_errlog

 `dbms_errlog` consists of one procedure only: `create_error_log`. This procedure creates
*error logging tables* into which → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML[DML statements] can write records that caused an error. Thus, DML statements
can continue without potentially stopping an entire load in a → development/Data/warehouse[DWH] environment.

{ Example

  Create a table (`tq84_src`) which will contain the data that
  is attempted to be filled into the destination table `tq84_dest`:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/errlog/table.sql||

  Create the error table:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/errlog/error-table.sql||

  Fill the source table:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/errlog/insert-src.sql||

  Try to insert data into the dest table. Without error log clause,
  the first statement would fail with a primary key violation and
  a division by zero error:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/errlog/insert-dest.sql||

  Because of the error log clause, we can find the errors in the
  error log table:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/errlog/select.sql||

}
