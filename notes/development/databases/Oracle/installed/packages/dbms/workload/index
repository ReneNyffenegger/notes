The `DBMS_WORKLOAD_CAPTURE` package is used to capture a database workload.

A workload capture created using this package can be replayed later in a different database that is properly setup.

The `DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPLAY package` is used to:
 • Process the captured workload and make it suitable for replaying.
 • Initiate and control the replay

`dbmw_workload_capture` and `dbmw_workload_replay` views are installed by `catwrrvw.sql`
