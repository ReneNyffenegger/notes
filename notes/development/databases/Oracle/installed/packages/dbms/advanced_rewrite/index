{ Simple example

  The user of the functionality of `dbms_advanced_rewrite` needs to have two → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privileges].
  These cannot, obviously, be granted by the user receiving them:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dbms/advanced_rewrite/intro/grant.sql||

  Then, the user that received the privileges, creates a table and inserts some data …
  gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dbms/advanced_rewrite/intro/table-1.sql||

  … creates a *rewrite equivalency* … 
  gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dbms/advanced_rewrite/intro/equivalence-1.sql||

  … and selects from the table on which the equivaleny was defined:
  gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dbms/advanced_rewrite/intro/select-1.sql||

  Cleaning up
code {
begin
   sys.dbms_advanced_rewrite.drop_rewrite_equivalence('return_twice_the_num');
end;
/

drop table tq84_rewrite_tab_1;
code }

}

sa:

  Defined rewrite equivalences can be queried from the → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary views `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/rewrite_equivalences` etc.
