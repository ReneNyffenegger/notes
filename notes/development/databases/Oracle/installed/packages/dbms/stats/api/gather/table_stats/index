$ DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS

{ Commit or no commit

  Oracle's doumentation of → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/stats[`dbms_stats`] (as of 21c) says
  "
    Most procedures in this package commit the current transaction, perform the operation, and then commit again.
  "

  (By default?), gathering stats on a → development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables/types/global-temporary[global temporary table] (that is not owned by
  → development/databases/Oracle/users-roles/users/oracle-maintained/sys[SYS]) does not
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/TCL/commit the current → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction, on (all?) other types
  of tables, it does.

  More investigations on this behavior was done → https://blog.dbi-services.com/12c-dbms_stats-gather_table_stats-on-gtt-do-not-commit/[by Franck Pachot].
