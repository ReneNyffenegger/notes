{ gather_fixed_objects_stats

  Collect statistics on → development/databases/Oracle/installed/fixed-views[fixed objects].

  `dbms_stats.gather_fixed_objects_stats` is quite similar to `dbms_stats.gather_table_stats` except that the number of blocks is set to 0 because `x$` tables reside in memory
  (→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA) rather than on disk.
