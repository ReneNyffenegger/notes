When the cursor is not used anymore, it should be closed with `dbms_sql.close_cursor`.

code {
declare
   c integer;
begin
   c := dbms_sql.open_cursor;

   → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/sql/parse(c, q'[ SQL STATEMENT GOES HERE ]', dbms_sql.native);

   …

   dbms_sql.close(c);
end/
/
code }

After opening the cursor, the text of the SQL statement must be parsed using → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/sql/parse[`dbms_sql.parse`].
