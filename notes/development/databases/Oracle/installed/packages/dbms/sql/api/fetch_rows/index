$ Oracle: dbms_sql.fetch_rows

`dbms_sql.fetch_rows` must be called repeatedly to fetch all rows from a select statement.
-
The return value corresponds to the number of records fetched (multiple records are fetched if development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/sql/api/define_array[`define_array`] was used).
When no more rows can be fetched, the function returns 0.
