$ DBMS_SHARED_POOL.SIZES

`dbms_shared_pool.sizes(N)` shows objects that occupy more than `N kb` memory in the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA/Shared-Pool[shared pool].

This procedure prints the values using `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/output`. Thus, when using the procedure in
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus, output must be enabled with `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/serveroutput[set serveroutput] on`.

An educated guess is that `sizes` selects from `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/db/object_cache`
and `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/area`.

code {
set serveroutput on
begin
   sys.dbms_shared_pool.sizes(1000);
end;

code }
