$ Oracle: DBMS_DESCRIBE
@ dbms_describe

`dbms_describe` provides information about a → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] object. As of 19C, it has one procedure only: `describe_procedure`. This procedure returns the same
information as the `OCIDescribeAny` function.

Let `dbms_describe.describe_procedure` describe itself:
gh|oracle-patterns|/Installed/dbms/describe/describe_procedure.sql||

{ VARCHAR2_TABLE and NUMBER_TABLE

 `dbms_describe.varchar2_table` is a `table of dbms_id index by binary_integer`,
  -
 `dbms_describe.number_table` is a `table of number index by binary_integer`.

}
