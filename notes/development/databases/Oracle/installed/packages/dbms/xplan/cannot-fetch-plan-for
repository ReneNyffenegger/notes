$ DBMS_XPLAN - error message: cannot fetch plan for …

When using → development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/xplan[`dbms_xplan`] in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus and
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/serveroutput[`serveroutput`] is enabled, an error message as shown below will be thrown:
code {
NOTE: cannot fetch plan for SQL_ID: 9babjv8yq8ru3, CHILD_NUMBER: 1
      Please verify value of SQL_ID and CHILD_NUMBER;
      It could also be that the plan is no longer in cursor cache (check → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views/sql/plan[v$sql_plan])
code }

Of course, the tip to check `v$sql_plan` is misleading in that case. The error message can be turned of with a
code {
SQL> → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/set/serveroutput off
code }
