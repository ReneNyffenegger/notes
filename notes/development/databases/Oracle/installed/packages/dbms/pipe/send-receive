$ DBMS_PIPE: most simple example (send and receive)

The following two scripts `blue.sql` and `green.sql` need to be executed in two separate → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/session[sessions].

{ blue.sql

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/pipe/send_receive/blue.sql||

}
{ green.sql

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/pipe/send_receive/green.sql||

}
{ session_blue.bat
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/pipe/send_receive/session_blue.bat||
}

{ session_green.bat
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/pipe/send_receive/session_green.bat||
}

{ run.bat

  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/dbms/pipe/send_receive/run.bat||

}
