$ Oracle DBMS_UTILITY: FORMAT_xxx functions

{ Errors

  In order to examine the format of `format_error_stack` and `format_error_backtrace`, → #dbms_utility-format-error[these PL/SQL packages] were written.
  -
  When executed, `dbms_utility.format_error_stack` and `dbms_utility.format_error_backtrace` return a result like shown below

 `format_error_stack`:
code {
ORA-00900: invalid SQL statement
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_1", line 11
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_2", line 11
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_2", line 4
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_1", line 4
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_2", line 8
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_1", line 8
code }

  `format_error_backtrace`:
code {
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_1", line 11
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_2", line 11
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_2", line 4
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_1", line 4
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_2", line 8
ORA-06512: at "RENE.TQ84_PKG_1", line 8
ORA-06512: at line 2
code }

  Both are quite similar. `format_error_stack` includes an → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[SQL code]
 (for example → development/databases/Oracle/errors/ORA-06512_at-line[`ORA-06512`]) and an error message (compare with
  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL/block/exception-handler/sqlerrm-sqlcode[`sqlerrm` and `sqlcode`]) which
  is missing in `format_error_backtrace`. On the other hand, the last line of `format_error_backtrace` is missing in `format_error_stack`.

  The general format of the result is:
code {
ORA-xxxxx: as yyy.zzzz, line nn    <--     Line in second exception handler that re-raised exception
ORA-xxxxx: as yyy.zzzz, line nn    <--   Line in first exception handler that re-raised exception
ORA-xxxxx: as yyy.zzzz, line nn    <-- Line where error was caused
ORA-xxxxx: as yyy.zzzz, line nn    <--   Line that called procedure with error
ORA-xxxxx: as yyy.zzzz, line nn    <--     Line that called procedure which then called procedure with error
ORA-xxxxx: as yyy.zzzz, line nn    <--       …
code }

  As can be seen: because of the nestedness of these lines, the line where the real error has occured cannot be found without manual inspection of all lines that are listed in the output.
