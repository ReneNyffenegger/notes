$ Oracle: DBMS_UTILITY.EXPAND_SQL_TEXT
@ dbms_utility.expand_sql_text

`expand_sql_text` is helpful in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[SQL analysis]: it translates an
→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement that references
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/views[views] or
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/synonyms[synonyms] into a query with the identical meaning, but references
→ development/databases/Oracle/objects/tables[tables] only.

Unfortunately, the expanded SQL text does not contain any → development/line-break[new lines] or indentation.
