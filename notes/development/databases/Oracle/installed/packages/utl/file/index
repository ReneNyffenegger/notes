$ Oracle: UTL_FILE
@ utl_file

`utl_file` provides some functions to access data stored in «ordinary» files (i.e. outside of → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/database/files/data[data files])
on the filesystem of the server where the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance is running.

Only files in file-system directories for which a corresponding → development/databases/Oracle/objects/directories[Oracle directory object] was created can be accessed with `utl_file`.

`utl_file` assumes the files it reads or writes are to be in the → development/Unicode/character-set specified with → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/nls#ora-nls_characterset[`nls_characterset`].

{ Examples

  Create a file and write three lines into it:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/utl/file/create_file.plsql||

  Read the file linewise:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/utl/file/read_created_file.plsql||

  Read entire file:
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/utl/file/read_created_file_until_end.plsql||
 
  Delete the file
  gh|Oracle-Patterns|/Installed/utl/file/delete_created_file.plsql||
}
