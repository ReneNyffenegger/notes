$ UTL_RAW.CAST_TO_datatype

The `cast_to_<datatype>` functions of `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/raw` include:
  • `cast_to_binary_double`
  • `cast_to_binary_float`
  • `cast_to_binary_integer`
  • `cast_to_number`
  • `cast_to_nvarchar2`
  • `cast_to_raw`
  • `cast_to_varchar2`

 `utl_raw.cast_to_raw` takes into account the current value of `nls_characterset`. With `AL32UTF8` (which is essentially → development/Unicode/UTF-8), the value for é is 0xc3a9.
  -
  If I executed the same PL/SQL block in an environment where the value of `nls_characterset` is `WE8MSWIN1252`, the block would print `52 65 6E E9`.
