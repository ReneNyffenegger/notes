The *processlist* seems to show connected users:

code}

code {
create table tab (a integer) engine = myIsam;
code }

code {
set global innodb_file_per_table=1;
code }

If the `innodb_file_per_table` option is set, a table can be (or is?) created in its own *.ibd* file rather than in a shared *ibdata file* of the *system tablespace*.
-
This option is enabled by default.

An *instance* is a `mysqld` daemon in Unix or (probably) a → Windows/services[service] in → Windows that listens on its designated → development/web/TCP-IP[TCP] port (the default being 3306).
-
An instance manages a *data directory* (that in turn consists of one ore more *databases*).

The `mybinsqllog` command examines the content of *bin logs* (binary log files).

MySQL's equivalent of Oracle's *index-organized tables* are *clustered indexes*.

A *database* is the same thing as a *schema* (both words are used synonously.

The *data directory* is the directory under which an *instance* stores *data files* for InnoDB.
-
Do data directories contain a sub-directory for each database?
-
Compare the `datadir` configuration option.

{ Starting mysql client

  Apparently, there must be no space between the `-p` option and the password.

code {
mysql -u rene -psecretGarden
mysql -u rene -psecretGarden --local-infile
mysql -u rene -psecretGarden tq84_db
mysql -u rene -psecretGarden tq84_db < script.sql
code }

}
{ User accounts

   An *account name* consists of a *user name* and a *host name*. The syntax to specify an account name is `'rene'@'host.xyz'`.

  `'rene'@'%'` is equvalent to `'rene``.

code {
create user rene@localhost identified by 'rene';
create user rene@'%'       identified by 'rene';
code }

code {
grant all on tq84_db.* to rene@localhost;
grant all on tq84_db.* to rene@'%';
grant all on       *.* to …
code }

  Special (reserved) accounts are:
    • `'root'@'localhost'`
    • `'mysql.sys'@'localhost'`
    • `'mysql.session'@'localhost'`
    • `'mysql.infoschema'@'localhost'`

}
{ Engines

code {
show engines;
select * from information_schema.engines;
select @@default_storage_engine;
code }

  The default storage engine in MySQL 8 is *InnoDB*.

  { InnoDB

    InnoDB is a *multi-versioned storage engine*.

code {
select * from information_schema.innodb_tables where name = 'ts/tab';
code }

  }

}
{ SQL modes

code {
show variables like 'sql_mode';

select @@global.sql_mode;
select @@session.sql_mode;
code }

code {
set session sql_mode = '…';
set global  sql_mode = '…';
code }

}
{ Databases

code {
select database();
code }

}
{ Importing CSV files

code {
show variables like 'local_infile';
show variables like 'secure_file_priv';
code }

  The default location that `secure_file_priv` points to is → Windows/dirs/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL-Server-X_Y/Uploads.

  The `local_infile` option controls if the server permits *local data loading* (`load data local`).

 `load data` statements without `character set` clause default to using the value of the `character_set_database` system varible.

  Start `mysql` with the `--local-infile` option
code {
mysql -u rene -prene --local-infile tq84_db
code }

}
{ Character sets and collations

  The *reportoire* of a → development/Unicode/character-set[character set] is the collection of characters in the set.

  MySQL Server has a *server character set* and a *server collation* which are set at startup (options `--character-set-server=…` and
  `--collation-server=…`).
  -
  Similarly, a database has a *database character set* and a *database collation*.
  -
  Similarly, every character string has a *character set* and a *collation*

  System variables `character_set_database`, `character_set_connection`, `collation_connection`.

  `utf8` is an alias for the `utf8mb3` character set and stores a maximum of three bytes per character. It allows to represent the
  → development/Unicode/Codepoints[code points] `0x0000` through `0xffff`, thus, it cannot store all Unicode characters. `utf8mb3 is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of MySQL, probably in favour of utf8mb4.
  -
  `utf8mb4` is what most of the world would call → development/Unicode/UTF-8[utf-8]. It uses up to four bytes per character and thus allows to store supplemental characters (such as emoji).

code {
show character set;
show character set like 'utf8%'
show collation where charset = 'utf8mb4';

select * from information_schema.character_sets order by character_set_name;

select * from information_schema.collations where character_set_name = 'utf8mb4' order by collation_name;
code }

code {
select
  @@character_set_database,
  @@collation_database;
code }

code {
select
   default_character_set_name,
   default_collation_Name
from
   information_schema.schemata
where
   schema_name = 'tq84_db';
code }

code {
create table tab (
   col_1 varchar(50) character set ascii,
   col_2 varchar(50) character set latin1
);
code }

code {
set names ascii;
set names utf8;
code }

  In the following example, `_utf8` and `_ucs2` are called *introducers*.
code {
select
  _utf8'foo'    collate …,
  _ucs2 X'0041' collate …
code }

code {
show variables like 'character_set_system';
code }

  Collation suffixes:
    • `_ai`  - Accent insentive
    • `_as`  - Accent sensitive
    • `_ci`  - Case insentive
    • `_cs`  - Case sensitive
    • `_ks`  - Kana sensitive
    • `_bin` - Binary


  { National character set

     `nvarchar(10) character set utf8` = `national varchar(10)` == `nvarchar(10)` == `nchar varchar(10)` == `national character varying(10)` == `national char varying(10)`.

     `char(10) character set utf8` == `national character(10)` == `nchar(10)`.

     `N'foo bar'` == `n'foo bar'` == `_utf8'foo bar'`.


  }

code {
create database db_xyz
       character set utf8mb4
       collate       utf8mb4_0900_as_cs  -- Accent and case sensitive.
;
code }

}
{ System variables

code {
show variables;
show variables like '%some_text%';
code }

  Changing (global?) system variables. However, it does not seem to survive a bounce.
code {
set global local_infile = on;
code }

}
{ Security

  Is `mysql -u root` possible?

code {
show grants;
show grants for 'rene'@'somewhere.net';
code }

  The `secure_file_priv` system variable.

  The `user` option under `[mysqld]` in the configuration file.

  Is *autocommit* set? How is it turned off?
