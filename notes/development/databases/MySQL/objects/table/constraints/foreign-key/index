$ MySQL: foreign key constraints

{ TODO

  When `foreign_key_checks` is enabled (default setting),
  character set conversion is not permitted on tables that include a character string column used in a foreign key constraint.

  The required index on the parent table is automatically created along with the foreign key if it does not already exist.

 `information_schema.key_column_usage`

}
