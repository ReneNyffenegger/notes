$ SQL Server: Big Data Clusters (BDC)
@ Big Data Clusters

A *Big Data Cluster* allows to build scalable clusters using
  • → development/databases/SQL-Server
  • → development/Apache/Spark
  • → development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS containers 

After deploying a BDC, the (so called) → development/Big-Data contained in the HDFS can be processed with → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL or Spark.

{ Deploying BDCs

  Big Data Clusters are deployed on Kubernetes.

  After Kubernetes has been configured, the Big Data Cluster can be created with
code {
azdata bdc create
code }

}
