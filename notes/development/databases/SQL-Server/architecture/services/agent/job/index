$ SQL Server Agent: job

There is one record for each job in `msdb.dbo.sysjobs` system table.

A job consists of one or more *job steps*. These are tracked in `msdb.dbo.sysjobsteps`.

The current state of each job per session is stored in 
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/msdb/dbo/tables/sysjobactivity[`msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity`].

→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/msdb/dbo/tables/sysjobhistory[`msdb.dbo.sysjobhistory`] records the execution of job steps, usually after a step finishes. (There are exceptions to this rule, however).

→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/msdb/dbo/tables/sysjobschedules[`msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules`] links jobs and *schedules*. A job can be linked to multiple schedules, and a schedules can be linked to multiple jobs.

→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/msdb/dbo/tables/sysjobsteps[`msdb.dbo.sysjobsteps`]

A job might be manipulated (for example inactivated) with `msdb.dbo.sp_update_job`.

A job can be started manually with `msdb.dbo.sp_start_job`

Jobs are executed by → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/services/agent
