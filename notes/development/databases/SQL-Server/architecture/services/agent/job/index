$ SQL Server Agent: job

There is one record for each job in `msdb.dbo.sysjobs` system table.

A job consists of one or more *job steps*. These are tracked in `msdb.dbo.sysjobsteps`.

The current state of each job is stored in `msdb.dbo.sysjobactivity`. There is a 1:1 relationship between `sysjobs` and `sysjobactivity`.

`msdb.dbo.sysjobhistory` records the execution of job steps, usually after a step finishes. (There are exceptions to this rule, however).

`msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules` links jobs and *schedules*. A job can be linked to multiple schedules, and a schedules can be linked to multiple jobs.

Jobs are executed by â†’ development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/services/agent
