{ Service states

  The state of a service is displayed in → Windows/dirs/Windows/SysWOW64/SQLServerManagernn_msc[Configuration Manager] and
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/Management-Studio[Management Studio]:
  table { lll

   *state*  ☰*Configuration Manager*  ☰*Management Studio*

    paused  ☰ two vertical blue lines ☰ two vertical white lines on blue circle

  table }


}
{ Start and stop services #mssql-change-service-state

  The state of a service might be changed with the
   *→ development/databases/SQL-Server configuration manager* (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/SysWOW64/SQLServerManagernn_msc[`SQLServerManager….msc`]).

  In a console (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell), a service can be started or stopped with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe[`net.exe`].
  -
  Startup options can be added at the end of the command (with slashes (`/`) rather than hyphens (`-`):
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe/start[net start] "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)" /f /m
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe/start[net start] MSSQLSERVER /f /m
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe[net] stop  MSSQLSERVER
code }

  Then, there is also the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/shutdown[T-SQL statement `shutdown`]. 

}
