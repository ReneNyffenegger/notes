$ SQL Server: checkpoint
@ checkpoint

A checkpoint flushes dirty → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/page[data pages] from the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/buffer-cache to the hard disk.

A checkpoint is automatically executed before a backup. Thus, the backup contains all changes made to → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/page[pages].

sa:
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture
