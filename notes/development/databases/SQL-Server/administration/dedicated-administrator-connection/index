$ SQL Server: dedicated administrator connection (DAC)

A *dedicated administrator connections (DAC)* is the last resort for a → development/databases/DBA when trying to fix an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance where no new connections are possible anymore because its resources
are exhausted. For such situations, SQL server always retains a limited chunk of memory and other necessary resources to allow a *last* connection: the *dedicated administrator connection*.

A DAC is also required to select from the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/system-base-tables.


{ Connect with Management Studio

  With → development/databases/SQL-Server/Management-Studio, a dedicated administrator connection cannot be opened with the usual connection method. The following error is thrown.
 "
   Dedicated administrator connections are not supported via SSMS as it establishes multiple connections by design.
      (Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SqlStudio.Explorer)
 "

  A dedicated administrator connection needs to be established with a *Database Engine Query*. This is found in the menu File -> New -> Database Engine Query:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/administration/DAC/img/Management-Studio_Database-Engine-Query.png||

  When the connection dialog opens, the *server name* needs to be prefixed with `admin:`:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/administration/DAC/img/Management-Studio-use-admin.png||


}
{ Connect with sqlcmd

  In order to make a dedicated administrator connection with → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[`sqlcmd.exe`], the `-A` command line option needs to be specified:
code {
C:\> → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[sqlcmd] -S . -A
code }

}
{ Allow connections from any machine in the network

  By default, dedicated administrator connections are only allowed from a machine where the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance is running (because it
  listens on the *loop back device* `192.168.0.1` port 1434). In order to make a DAC from another machine in a network, the *remote admin connections* Server Configuration Option must
  be set:
code {
sp_configure 'remote admin connection', 1
go
reconfigure
go
code }

}
