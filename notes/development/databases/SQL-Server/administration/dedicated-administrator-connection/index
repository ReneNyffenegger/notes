$ SQL Server: dedicated administrator connection (DAC)


{ Connect with sqlcmd

  In order to make a dedicated administrator connection with → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[`sqlcmd.exe`], the `-A` command line option needs to be specified:
code {
C:\> → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[sqlcmd] -S . -A
code }

}
{ Allow connections from any machine in the network

  By default, dedicated administrator connections are only allowed from a machine where the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance is running (because it
  listens on the *loop back device* `192.168.0.1` port 1434). In order to make a DAC from another machine in a network, the *remote admin connections* Server Configuration Option must
  be set:
code {
sp_configure 'remote admin connection', 1
go
reconfigure
go
code }

}
