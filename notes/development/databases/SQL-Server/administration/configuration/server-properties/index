$ SQL Server Properties

The available server property names and their allowed value range can be queried from → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/configurations[`sys.configurations`].

Server property values can be altered in → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_configure[`sp_configure` stored procedure]. After changing
a value, the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/reconfigure[`reconfigure` statement] needs to be executed.

`sp_configure`, when executed without arguments, shows the current values for server properties.
