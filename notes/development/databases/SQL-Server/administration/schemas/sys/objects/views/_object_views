$ SQL Server: comparison of object views
-

There are four views in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys[sys schema] that seem to be able to query
about objects in a → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database:
  • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/all_objects,
  • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/objects,
  • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sysobjects,
  • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/system_objects

{ Compare the definitions of these views

  The following script allows to compare the definitions of these four views:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/comparison-object-views.sql||

}
