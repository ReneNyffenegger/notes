$ SQL Server: sp_rename

`sp_rename` can be used to change the name of → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table[tables], views,
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedures], columns (and other objects?)

{ Rename a table

  gh|about-MSSQL|/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_rename/rename-table.sql||

}
{ Rename a colum

  The name of a column is changed analogously:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_rename/rename-column.sql||

  Note that → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table/column/computed[computed columns] cannot be renamed.
  
}
{ Misc

  Changing the name of views, functions, stored procedures or triggers with `sp_rename` does not change the corresponding object name in the
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sql_modules[`sys.sys_modules`] catalog view.

}
