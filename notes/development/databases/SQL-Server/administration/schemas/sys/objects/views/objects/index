{ type, type_desc

  `type` is a one or two letter abbreviation that defines the type of the object. `type_desc` is the human readable form for that type.

code {
select
   count(*),
   type,
   type_desc
from
   sys.objects
group by
   type,
   type_desc
order by
   type;
code }

  For example, type `PK` is a → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table/constraints/primary-key[primary key] and `UQ` a
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table/constraints/unique[unique] constraint.
  -
  Some information about these two types are found in → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/key/constraints[`sys.key_constraints`].
