$ SQL Server: system base tables
@ system base tables

The *system base tables* reside in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys[sys schema]. Most of the base tables are found in all
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database[databases], but some are only in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/master[master database].

A → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/dedicated-administrator-connection[dedicated administrator connection] is needed to be able to select from them.
