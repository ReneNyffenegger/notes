$ SQL Server: Schemas
@ schemas

A *schema* is a named set (a container) of *database objects*. It allows to group objects into *namespaces*.

A schema can be assigned security rules which will be inhertied to objects as they are created within the schema.

A schema has an owner which can be any database principal. (The same principal can own multiple schemas).

{ Default schema name

  The default schema name for a newly created → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database is `dbo`.

}
{ Query objects in a schema #mssql-search-object

  The following query finds all objects (tables, views etc.) in a schema:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/administration/schemas/sql/find-objects.sql||

  See also → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/columns#find-tables-by-column-name[find tables by column name].

}

{ Default schemas

  SQL Server comes with 10 (?) predefined schemas:
    • db_accessadmin
    • db_backupoperator
    • db_datareader
    • db_datawriter
    • db_ddladmin
    • db_denydatareader
    • db_denydatawriter
    • db_owner
    • dbo
    • guest
    • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/INFORMATION_SCHEMA
    • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys

  All of these schemas except dbo, guest, sys and INFORMATION_SCHEMA can be dropped.

  The available schemas can be queried in
    • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/schemas[`sys.schemas`]
