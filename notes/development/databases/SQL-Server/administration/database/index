$ SQL Server: database
@ database

A database belongs to an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[instance].

The data of a database is stored in files (of a file system). These files can be grouped into so called *file groups*.

The name of the currently connected database can be queried with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions#t-sql-db_name[`db_name()`] function.

The default schema for a newly created database is `dbo`.

{ Schemas

  A database has one or more *schemas*. A schema is a group of objects (such as tables, views, stored procedures etc.) with a specific *ownership*.

  Apparently, each database has a `sys` schema.

  Some special objects suach as certificates and asymmetric keys are not found in a schema but in the database itself.
