$ SQL Server: database
@ database

A database belongs to an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[instance].

The data of a database is stored in files (of a file system). These files can be grouped into so called *file groups*.

The name of the currently connected database can be queried with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions#t-sql-db_name[`db_name()`] function.

The default → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas[schema] for a newly created database is `dbo`.

{ Schemas

  A database has one or more development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas[schemas]. A schema is a group of objects (such as tables, views, stored procedures etc.) with a specific *ownership*.

  Each database has a → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys[`sys`] schema which stores (among others?)
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures/system[system stored procedures] (`sp_…`).

  Some special objects such as certificates and asymmetric keys are not found in a schema but in the database itself.

  When → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects#mssql-fully-qualified-obj-name[fully qualifying] an → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects[object] name, the database is the third last, the schema the second last element:
code {
select * from     DB.SCH.OBJ;
select * from SRV.DB.SCH.OBJ;
code }

}
{ Templates for newly created databases

  Newly created database inherit some charactersistics from the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/model → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases[system database].
