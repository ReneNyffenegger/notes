$ SQL Server: database
@ database

A database belongs to an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[instance].

The data of a database is stored in files (of a file system). These files can be grouped into so called *file groups*.

The name of the currently connected database can be queried with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions#t-sql-db_name[`db_name()`] function.

The default → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas[schema] for a newly created database is `dbo`.

{ Schemas

  A database has one or more → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas[schemas]. A schema is a group of objects (such as tables, views, stored procedures etc.) with a specific *ownership*.

  Each database has a → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys[`sys`] schema which stores (among others?)
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures/system[system stored procedures] (`sp_…`).

  Some special objects such as certificates and
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/security/keys/asymmetric[asymmetric keys] are not found in a schema but in the database itself.

  When → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects#mssql-fully-qualified-obj-name[fully qualifying] an → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects[object] name, the database is the third last, the schema the second last element:
code {
select * from     DB.SCH.OBJ;
select * from SRV.DB.SCH.OBJ;
code }

}
{ Templates for newly created databases

  Newly created database inherit some charactersistics from the → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/model → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases[system database].

}
{ Server logins's default database

  Each server login (server principal) is assigned a default database. This database can be queried from the column `default_database_name` in
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/server_principals[`sys.server_principals`].

}
{ Database owner #mssql-db-owner

  A database has an owner:
code {
select
   suser_sname(owner_sid) database_owner,
   name                   database_name, 
   state_desc        , -- Online?
   owner_sid
from
   sys.databases
code }

 *Within* a database, its owner is known as the *dbo* of the database.

  The owner of a database (except for → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/master[master],
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/model[model] and
  development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/system-databases/tempdb[tempdb]) can be changed with → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_changedbowner[`sp_changedbowner`] (which is in so-called maintenance mode) or
 `alter authorization`.

}
{ Operating system files

  Every database is associated with at least one → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database/files/data and one
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database/files/log.

  Data files physically store → development/Data of → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects[objects] such as
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table[tables], indexes, → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedures] and views.

  Log files store the necessary information to recover → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/transaction[transactions].
