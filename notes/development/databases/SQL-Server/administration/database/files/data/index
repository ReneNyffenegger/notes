@ data file

Data files physically store → development/Data of → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects[objects] such as
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table[tables], indexes, → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedures] and views.

{ Primary and secondary data files #mssql-primary-secondary-data-files

  Every → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database has one primary data file and an optional number of secondary data files.

  The primary data file stores the information that is needed to start a database up and the location of the secondary data files.

  The typical → development/filename-extensions[extension] for primary data files is → development/filename-extensions#mdf[`.mdf`] and 
  → development/filename-extensions#ndf[`.ndf`] for secondary data files.
