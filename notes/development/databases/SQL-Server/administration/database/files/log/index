$ SQL Server: log files
@ log file

*Log files* store the → development/Data that is needed to recover → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/transaction[transactions].

The typical → development/filename-extensions[filename extension] of log files is → development/filename-extensions#ldf[`.ldf`].

Because log files are written whenever a transaction commits, they often have high I/O rates and for good performance, it's crucial that data can be written fast.
