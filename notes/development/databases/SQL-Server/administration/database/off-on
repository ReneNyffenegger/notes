$ SQL Server: offlining and onlining a database

`db-off-on.sql` is a script, to be called with → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd, that offlines and onlines a → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database[database].

I usually use this script to maker sure that no → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/session[session] is running in a particular database, for example, before executing a deployment script etc.

When the script is called, the name of the database needs to be stored in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd#sqlcmd-variable[sqlcmd variable `DB`], which can be set with the `-v` option:
code {
P:\ath\to\script\dir>  sqlcmd -S server_name -i db-off-on.sql -v DB=database_name
code }

*Note* that the database is offlined with the `rollback immediate` option. That means that modifications of currently running → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/transaction[transactions] are lost.
