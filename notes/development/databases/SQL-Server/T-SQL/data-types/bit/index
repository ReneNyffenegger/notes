$ SQL Server - bit datatype (used for boolean like values)

SQL server does not have a real → development/databases/SQL/data-types/predefined/boolean[boolean] → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types[datatype] (which would be named `bool` or `boolean`). In order to store
boolean like values in SQL Server, the `bit` datatype is needed. It can assume the three values `0`, `1` and → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/null[`null`].

Because SQL server does not have a »real« boolean datatype, it also does not have the constant values `true` and `false`.
