$ SQL Server: Functions cannot return UDTs (User defined types)

Unfortunately, in *SQL Server*, it's impossible to return (table of) *user defined types from a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/user-defined-functions[function].
Thus, in order to come close to something like returning such a table, we have to resort to a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/user-defined-functions/table-valued[table valued function].
-
This is demonstrated in the following.

{ Create a user defined type

  The following `create type` statement creates a simple user defined type with two attributes.

  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/user-defined-functions/table-valued/return-udt/crate-udt.sql||

}
{ Create a function

  The following function can be passed a (table of) records that correspond to the user defined type and a string that specifies which records from the udt should be filter.
  -
  It uses a `insert into` statement with a `like` to actually select the matching rows into the variable that is returned and then returns this variable.

}
{ Using the function

  Finally, the function is used:

}
