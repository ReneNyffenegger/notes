{ Table valued functions

  A function can return a single rowset.
  
  Such functions are known as → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/user-defined-functions/table-valued[table valued functions].

}
{ DML statements

  Apparently, a user defined function cannot modify data in a database (execute → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/DML[DML statements]).

  Thus, instead of putting the DML statement into a function, a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[procedure] might be created that uses
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures#t-sql-proc-output-param[output parameters].

}

sa:
  (User defined) → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedure]
