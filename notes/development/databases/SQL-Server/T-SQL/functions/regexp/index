$ SQL Server: regular expression functions

Apparently, → development/databases/SQL-Server[SQL Server] does not come with functions that handle → development/regular-expressions[regular expressions].
-
However, it is possible to use *OLE automation* along with the
→ Windows/development/COM/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-VBScript-Regular-Expressions[Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions] COM library within → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/user-defined-functions[user defined functions] with which it is possible to create
a `regexp_replace()` function.

{ regexp_replace #mssql-regexp_replace

  Then, we can create a `regexp_replace(…)` function:

  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/functions/regexp/replace.sql||

}
{ regexp_like

  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/functions/regexp/like.sql||

}
{ Enabling OLE automation

  In order to execute these functions, we need to enable OLE automation. Without enabling it, SQL Server throws the error message
  *SQL Server blocked access to procedure 'sys.sp_OACreate' of component 'Ole Automation Procedure' because this component is turned off as part of the security configuration for this server. …*

  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/functions/regexp/enable-OLE.sql||

  Without enabled OLE automation

}
