$ SQL Server function: isNull

code {
isNull(expr, val-if-expr-is-null)
code }

`isNull` evaluates to the the value of `expr` except if this value is → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/null[`null`]. In this case, the function evaluates to the value of `val-if-expr-is-null`.

sa:

  Oracle's equivalent of `isNull` is → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/functions/null-related#nvl[`nvl`] (I am not sure if `isNull` also evaluates its expressions lazily, however).

  The SQL Server function `isNull` behaves differently from VBA's/Access's → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc[`isNull`] function.

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions
