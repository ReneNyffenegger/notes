$ SQL Server function: format


code {
format(expr, fmt)
format(expr, fmt, culture)
code }

`format` represents `expr` as specified in the format string `fmt`. `fmt` is a *.NET Framework format string*.


{ Formatting numbers

  As far as I can tell, there is no elegant → development/languages/printf[printf] equivalent for → development/databases/SQL-Server[SQL Server] to create strings with a specific format. The function that comes closest to the functionality
  of printf seems to be `format`.

{ Formatting dates #t-sql-format-dates

  A → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/_date-time[date or time value] can also be represented in string format with `format` (which then sort of simulates the → development/misc/strftime[`strftime`] function).

  The following few format strings are the ones that I find the most useful for dates:

  Compare with the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date/format[VBA function `format`].

}

{ Misc

 `format` requires the *.NET Framework Common Language Runtime (CLR)* to be present and can therefore not be remoted.
