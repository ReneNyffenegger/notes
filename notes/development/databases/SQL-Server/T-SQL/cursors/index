$ SQL Server: cursors

A cursor is, like → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables[variables], declared with the
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/declare[declare statement].
-
However, unlike other variables, the name of the cursor is not prefixed with an at sign (`@`).
-
Also, the cursors need to be declared seperately from other variables, that is, each of them needs their own `declare` statement.
