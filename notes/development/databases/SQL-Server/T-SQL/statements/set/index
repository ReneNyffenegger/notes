$ SQL Server - set statement

{ set nocount

Turn off printing `42 row(s) affected`:
code {
set nocount on;
code }

Apparently, a construct such as `set count off` is not easily possible because `count` is already an → development/databases/SQL[SQL] keyword.


}

sa:
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements[statements]
