$ SQL Server - set statement

{ On / off options

  The `set` statement can be used to set boolean like options to `on` or unset `off` (such as `nocount`).
  
  Wich options are set is stored in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/atat/options[`@@options`] variable.

}

{ set language #mssql-set-language

code {
set language english;
…
set language german;
…
code }

  The current language is stored in `@@language`.

  The chosen language apperantly influences how a string is interpreted if → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/date#mssql-cast-as-datetime[cast to a datetime].

}
{ set nocount

Turn off printing `42 row(s) affected`:
code {
set nocount on;
code }

Apparently, a construct such as `set count off` is not easily possible because `count` is already an → development/databases/SQL[SQL] keyword.

}

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements[statements]
