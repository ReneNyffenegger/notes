$ SQL Server: set ansi_nulls


Get current value for `ansi_nulls`:
code {
select case when → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/atat/options/[@@options] & power(2,  5) > 0 then 'yes' else 'no' end;
code }

{ Stored procedures

  When a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedure] is created, the currently set value of `ansi_nulls` is stored with the procedure. When the procedure
  is executed, it runs with this value (rather than the one that is active when the procedure is executed).

  The same applies to the setting → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set/quoted_identifier[`quoted_identifier`] as well.

}
{ Heterogenous queries

 *Heterogenous queries* require the setting of `ansi_nulls` (as well as that of → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set/ansi_warnings[`ansi_warnings`]) to be set to `on`.

}

sa:
  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set[T-SQL `set` statement]
