$ SQL Server: set ansi_nulls

When a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedure] is created, the currently set value of `ansi_nulls` is stored with the procedure. When the procedure
is executed, it runs with this value (rather than the one that is active when the procedure is executed).
-
The same applies to the setting → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set/quoted_identifier[`quoted_identifier`] as well.

Get current value for `ansi_nulls`:
code {
select case when → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/atat/options/[@@options] & power(2,  5) > 0 then 'yes' else 'no' end;
code }


sa:
  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set[T-SQL `set` statement]
