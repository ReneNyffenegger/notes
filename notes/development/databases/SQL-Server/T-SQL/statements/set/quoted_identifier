$ SQL Server: set quoted_identifier

{ Interpretation of quotation marks

  The value of `quoted_identifier` controls how `"quoted text"` is interpreted. If `quoted_identifier` is `on`, `"quoted text"` is taken to be an *identifier* (which is essentially the same
  as `[quoted text]`. If `quoted_identifier` is set to `off`, `"quoted text"` is interpreted as string (and is essentially the same thing as `'quoted text'`).

{ Get current value of quoted_identifier

  The current setting of `quoted_identifier` is encoded in the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/atat/options[`@@options`] variable:
  code {
select case when → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/atat/options[@@options] & power(2, 8) > 0 then 'yes' else 'no' end;
  code }

}
{ Value of quoted_identifier not retained across SQL batches #quoted_identifier-sql-batch

  The following demonstration shows that the value of `quoted_identifier` is not retained across → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/batch[SQL batches].

  In the first batch, `quoted_identifier` is set to `off` but after the `go` which initiates the second batch, the value is `on` again:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/statements/set/quoted_identifier/sql-batch.sql||

}
{ Value determined at parse time of SQL batch

  The value of `quoted_identifier` is determined at parse time of an SQL batch, not at compile time. This value is valid for the entire SQL batch. The last encountered setting wins.

  The following example demonstrates that `quoted_identifier` is `off` for the entire batch altough it *seems* to be switched off, on and off again:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/statements/set/quoted_identifier/parse-time.sql||

}
{ Filtered index

  The value of `quoted_identifier` must be `on` when a *filtered index* is created:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/statements/set/quoted_identifier/filtered-index.sql||

}
{ Current value of quoted_identifier stored with stored procedure when creating it

  When a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procedure] is created, the currently set value of `quoted_identifier` is stored with the procedure. When the procedure
  is executed, it runs with this value (rather than the one that is active when the procedure is executed).

  This is reflected in → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sql_modules[`sys.sql_modules`]:
code {
select
   uses_quoted_identifier
from
   sys.sql_modules
where
   object_id = …
code }
  

  The same applies to the setting → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set/ansi_nulls[`ansi_nulls`] as well.

}
sa:
  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set[T-SQL `set` statement]

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[`sqlcmd`], by default, sets `quoted_identifier` to `off`. This can be changed with the
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd#sqlcmd-quoted_identifier[`-I` option of `sqlcmd`].
