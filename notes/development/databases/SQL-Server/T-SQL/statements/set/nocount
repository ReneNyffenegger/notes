$ SQL Server: set nocount on|off

The value of `nocount` (which can be `on` or `off`) specifies if → development/databases/SQL-Server sends a message about the numbers of records affected to the client after executing one of the following
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/sql[SQL statements]:
  • `select`
  • `insert`
  • `update`
  • `merge`
  • `delete`

It's generally considered good practice to have a `set nocount on` statement as first statement in a
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[procedure].

sa:
  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set[T-SQL `set` statement]
