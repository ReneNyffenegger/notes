$ SQL Server: kill statement
@ kill

The `kill` statement can be used to terminate a process:
code {
kill session_id
kill UOW
kill session_id with statusonly
kill UOW        with statusonly
code }

The session id can be found in the column → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sysprocesses#sysprocesses-spid[`spid`] of the view
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sysprocesses[`sys.sysprocesses`].

{ kill SPID with statusonly

  Sometimes, killing a session takes longer than expected, typically because the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance needs to roll back a session's
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/transaction[transactions].

  In this case, `kill N with statusonly` can be used to get an estimation on how far the rolling back has proceeded:
code {
kill 61 with statusonly
 
SPID 61: transaction rollback in progress. Estimated rollback completion: 37%. Estimated time remaining: 195 seconds.
code }

}
