$ SQL Server T-SQL: if statement

The `if` statement allows to conditionally execute statements depending on the value of a boolean expression.

There is no `then`, `elseif` or `elsif` keyword in → development/databases/SQL-Server.

SQL-Server does not have a *real* → development/databases/SQL/data-types/predefined/boolean[boolean data type]. The closest it can offer
is the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/bit[`bit` data type]. However, even an expression that evaluates to a `bit` data type
needs to be explicetly compared to either `1` or `0` in an `if` statement as outlined → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/bit#mssql-bit-if[here].

{ With begin … end blocks

  If the `if` or `else` part controls more than one statement then they need to be enclosed in a `begin` … `end` block:
