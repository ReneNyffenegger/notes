$ SQL Server T-SQL: report exceptions with the throw statement

{ Throw and catch

  The following example creates the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[procedure] `tq84_check_percentage` which takes one argument (`@percentage`). The procedure then
  verifies if the value of this argument is between 0 and 100. If not, it reports this to the caller using a `throw` statement.

  The procedure is then called called in a block that is embedded in `begin try … end try` which allows to be notified of a such exception in the following `begin catch … end catch`.

  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/catch[`catch`] block then uses the function `error_message` which returns the text that was used in the `throw` statement.
