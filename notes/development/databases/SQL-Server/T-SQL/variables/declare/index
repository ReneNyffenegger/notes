$ SQL Server - T-SQL / variables - declare

The `declare` → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements[statement] is needed to associate a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables[variable] with a
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types[data type] or to define a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/cursors[cursor].

{ Scope #ms-sql-variable-scope

  Variables that are declared within a `begin … end` block are visible outside that block:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/t-sql/variables/declare/scope.sql||

  However, the scope of a variable ends with a → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/go[`go`].

}
{ Declare and assign a select statement's result #mssql-declare-assign-select

}
