$ SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
@ Management Studio

SSMS is an integrated environment to configure, monitor and administer → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[instances] of SQL Server.

{ Executing an SQL statement

  In order to execute a single SQL statement, in needs to be selected and executed by pressing `F5`. Unfortunately, it looks as thought its not possible
  to execute the statement in which the cursor is without selecting the SQL text first (as this in the case, for example, in → development/Software/TOAD[TOAD] with `ctrl+enter`).

  If accidentally `ctrl+shift+f` was pressed, the so called management studio tries to write a `*rpt` file (save as box opens). This can be undone with a `ctrl+d`.

}

{ Keyboard shortcuts

  { Query output

  `ctrl+t`: write output as text.

  `ctrl+d`: write output into grid.

  `ctrl+shift+f`: write result to file.

  `alt+break`: cancel a running query.

  `ctrl-alt-a` starts the *Activity Monitor*

  }
