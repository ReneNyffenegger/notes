$ SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
@ Management Studio

SSMS is an integrated environment to configure, monitor and administer → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[instances] of SQL Server.

{ Installation #ssms-install-chocolatey

  SSMS can be installed with → Windows/Chocolatey:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco_exe[choco] install -y sql-server-management-studio
code }

}

{ Executing an SQL statement

  In order to execute a single SQL statement, in needs to be selected and executed by pressing `F5`. Unfortunately, it looks as though its not possible
  to execute the statement in which the cursor is without selecting the SQL text first (as this in the case, for example, in
  → development/Software/Oracle-SQL-Developer or → development/Software/TOAD[TOAD] with `ctrl+enter`).

  If accidentally `ctrl+shift+f` was pressed, the so called Management Studio tries to write a `*rpt` file (save as box opens). This can be undone with a `ctrl+d`.

{ Keyboard shortcuts

  { Query output
    
    table { ll
      `ctrl+t` ☰ write output as text. Same as menu *Query -> Results To -> Results to Text*
      `ctrl+d` ☰ write output into grid. Same as menu *Query -> Results To -> Results to Grid*
      `ctrl+shift+f` ☰ write result to file.
      `alt+break` ☰ cancel a running query.
      `ctrl-alt-a` ☰ starts the *Activity Monitor*
    table }

  }

}
{ Object Explorer


  ~Server Objects -> Linked Servers -> Providers~: The list of → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB Providers] that an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[SQL Server instance] might access.
  -
  This list is maintained in the → Windows/registry under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Microsoft-SQL-Server/_instance-name_/Providers[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\instance name\Providers`].

}
{ Activity Monitor

  The activity monitor can be started with `ctrl-alt-a`, an icon in the menu bar or by right clicking on the instance in the *Object explorer*.

}
{ Menu Tools -> Options

  The entries under the menu entry *Tools* -> *Options* are configured in the → Windows/registry under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/SQL-Server-Management-Studio/v_v_Config/ToolsOptionsPages[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SQL Server Management Studio\v.v_Config\ToolsOptionsPages`].

  { Environment -> Keyboard

    Environment -> Keyboard allows to assign *keyboard shortcuts* to commands.

  }
  { Query Results -> SQL Server -> Results to Grid

    *Retain CR/LF on copy or save* should be the default - but its not. After ticking this check box, SSMS must be restarted to take effect.

  }

}
{ Menu Query 

  { SQLCMD Mode

    Using the Menu *Query* -> *SQLCMD Mode* allows to toggle → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[sqlcmd mode].

    If sqlcmd mode is toggled on, it allows to use such interesting features as → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd#sqlcmd-variable[variables] (`:setvar num 42` etc.).

    Apparently, other features such as *intellisense* or the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL debugger don't work with sqlcmd mode enabled. (But who cares about intellisense anyway…?)

  }
  { Query Options

    Under ~Results~ and ~Text~, the size of the characters that are returned in a column can be adjusted. The default is 256, the maximum is only 8192, unfortunately.

  }

}

{ TODO

  SQL Server Management Objects (SMOs) allow to manage SQL Server programmatically.
