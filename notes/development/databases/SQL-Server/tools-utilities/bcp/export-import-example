$ BCP - export import example

The following simple scripts try to demonstrate how → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/bcp can be used to export and import
→ development/Data from and into → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table[tables] on → development/databases/SQL-Server.

{ Export and import tables

  Two tables with data to be exported (`exp_test_p` and `exp_test_c`) as well as the corresponding import tables (`imp_test_p` and `imp_test_c`) are created:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/bcp/export-import/tables.sql||

}
{ Inserting data

  The export tables are populated with some sample data:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/bcp/export-import/data.sql||

}
{ Exporting the data

  The following → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files exports a subset of the data into the files `data_p.exp` and `data_c.exp`.

  The subset of the data is specified with the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/variables[variable] `%CONDITION_C%`.

  The `-t` flag specifies the field seperator. In our case, the vertical bar.

  The `-T` flag tells bcp to use a *trusted connection*.

  gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/bcp/export-import/export.bat||

}
  The data in `data_p.exp` and `data_c.exp` can now be imported into the destination tables:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/bcp/export-import/import.bat||

}
