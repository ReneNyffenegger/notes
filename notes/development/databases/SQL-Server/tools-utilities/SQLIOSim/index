The files that are created have (if not changed) `.mdx` and `.ldx` → development/filename-extensions[extensions] to prevent accidental overwriting of
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database/files/data[data files] and
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database/files/log[log files] (which have
→ development/filename-extensions#mdf[`.mdf`] and
→ development/filename-extensions#ldf[`.ldf`] extensions).
