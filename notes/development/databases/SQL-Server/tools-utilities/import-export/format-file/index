$ SQL Server: Format files

Format files are required for the T-SQL command → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/rowset/openrowset[`openrowset(bulk …)`] statement and can optionally be used
with `→ development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/bcp`.

There are XML and non-XML format files.

{ Structure of non-XML format files

  The first line specifies the version number.

  The second line specifies how many columns are described in the format file.

  Each of the following lines corresponds to a column.

  A column specificiation consists of eight parts:
  table { ll
     Host file field order ☰
     Host file data type ☰ See column → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types[Host file data type].
     Prefix length ☰ Valid values are 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8. 0 can be used to avoid specifying the length prefix, but a value must be supplied if the field contains `null` values.
     Host file data length ☰ Maximum length (bytes) of data in respective column
     Terminator ☰ Delimiter with which field are separated from one another.
     Server column order ☰ Set to 0 in order to not fill values in respective column.
     Server column name ☰ The name seems to have no influence, but must not be null.
     Collation of the column ☰
