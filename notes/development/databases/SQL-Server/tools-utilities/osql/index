$ SQL Server tool: osql
@ osql

*osql* is a console application, that is, it  is started from → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`],  → Windows/PowerShell, etc.

When started, osql reads → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql[SQL] and
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements[T-SQL statements] from
→ development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdin] and sends them to an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[SQL Server instance] for processing.
-
After processing, the result is then displayed on stdout.

osql uses → development/databases/ODBC to communicate with → development/databases/SQL-Server.

The executable of osql (`OSQL.EXE`) is located under
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-SQL-Server/version/Tools/Binn and/or
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server/version/Tools/Binn.

osql is deprecated in favor of → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd
