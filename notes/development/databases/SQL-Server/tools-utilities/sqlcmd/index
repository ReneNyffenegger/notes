$ SQL Server tool: sqlcmd
@ sqlcmd

The *sqlcmd* utility is very useful because it can be executed from a command line (→ Windows/cmd-exe). It might be the → development/databases/SQL-Server counterpart
to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/.

sqlcmd superseeds → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/osql.

{ Connect to an instance

  In order to connect to the default → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance of the SQL Server on the current machine simply use `sqlcmd`:
code {
C:\> sqlcmd
code }
  
  In order to connect to another instance, use the `-S` option.

code {
C:\> sqlcmd -S Hostname\InstanceName
code }

  If the instance is running on the same Server, instead of `Hostname`, a dot can be used:
 
code {
C:\> sqlcmd -S .\InstanceName
code }

}
{ Specify a script name

  An SQL Script can be specified with the `-i` option

code {
C:\> sqlcmd -S Hostname\InstanceName -i f:\project\some\script.sql
code }

  Other input options are `-Q` and `-q`.

}
{ Writing output to a file

  An output file can be stated with the `-o` option

code {
C:\> sqlcmd -S Hostname\InstanceName -i f:\project\some\script.sql -o f:\project\output\file.dat
code }

}
{ Authentification options

  Credentials for authentification to the Server can be specified with `-E`, `-U` and `-P`.
  
  `-E` (use Windows authentification) is the default.

}
{ Use a dedicated administrative connection

  With the `-A` option, a dedicated administrative connection (DAC) can be established.

{ Printing (echoing) text

{ Scripting variables

  { Defining scripting variables

    A scriptiong variable might be set with `:setvar`.
    -
    In an SQL script, the variable is referenced with `$(varName)`:
    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/setvar.sql||
  
    Alternatively, a variable can be set with when `sqlcmd` is started with the command line option `-y varName=varValue`.
    -
    The following script creates a table with one column and inserts one value into the table. All variables, table name, column name and inserted value, can be dynamically set when `sqlcmd` is executed with the `-i` and `-y` options:
    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/scripting-variables/dynamic-table-and-column-name.sql||

  }
  { Showing scripting variables #sqlcmd-listvar

    The currently set scripting variables can be displayed with
code {
:listvar
code }

  }
  { Predefined scripting variables

    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/scripting-variables/predefined.sql||

  }
}
{ Reading (sourcing) another file

  Another SQL script file can be read and executed with the `:r` command.
  gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/read-file.sql||

  Variables are passed to the read file
  gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/file-to-read.sql||

}
{ Connecting to another instance #connect

  With `:connect`, it's possible to connect to another → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance

code {
:connect Hostname\InstanceName
code }

}
{ Execute ad-hoc statements

  With the `-q` and `-Q` option, »ad-hoc statements« can be executed, that is: statements that are entered in `cmd.exe`:

code {
C:\> sqlcmd -q sp_who
exit
code }

code {
C:\> sqlcmd -Q sp_who
exit
code }

Both execute the `sp_who` stored procedure.

The difference between `-q` and `-Q` is that `-q` does not terminate the sqlcmd session after executing the given statement, so it must be explicitely exited. `-Q` just executes the specified statement and automatically exits.

}
{ Checking errorlevel in scripts

  When a script terminates with an error, it sets the corresponding `%errorlevel%`.
  
  This can be checked in a `.bat` file.

  { run-sql-script.bat

    This batch script tries to run the script that is passed as argument.

    If `sqlcmd` encounters an error, it immediatly returns (because of the `-b` option) and sets `%errorlevel%`. This
    can be checked by the script

    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/check-errorlevel/run-sql-script.bat||

    The at signs in front of each command prevent → Windows/cmd-exe from echoing the command when being run.

  }
  { script-with-error.sql

    The following script contains an error.

    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/check-errorlevel/script-with-error.sql||

  }
  { script-without-error.sql

    This script should be fine

    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/check-errorlevel/script-without-error.sql||

  }
  { exit-with-errorcode.sql

    This script `:exit`s with a specific errorcode

    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/check-errorlevel/exit-with-errorcode.sql||

  }
  { run-sql-scripts.bat

    `run-sql-scripts.bat` (note the plural) runs the three scripts.

    gh|about-MSSQL|/tools/sqlcmd/check-errorlevel/run-sql-scripts.bat||

  }
}
