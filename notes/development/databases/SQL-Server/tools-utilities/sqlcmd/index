$ SQL Server tool: sqlcmd
@ sqlcmd

The *sqlcmd* utility is very useful because it can be executed from a command line (→ Windows/cmd-exe). It might be the → development/databases/SQL-Server counterpart
to → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/.

sqlcmd superseeds → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/osql.

{ Connect to an instance

  In order to connect to the default → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance of the SQL Server on the current machine simply use `sqlcmd`:
code {
C:\> sqlcmd
code }
  
  In order to connect to another instance, use the `-S` flag

code {
C:\> sqlcmd -S Hostname\InstanceName
code }

}
