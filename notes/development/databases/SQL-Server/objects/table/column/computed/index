$ SQL Server: computed columns

{ Renaming computed columns

  Computed columns cannot be renamed with → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_rename[`sp_rename`]. They must be dropped and then
  be recreated:
  gh|about-MSSQL|/objects/table/column/computed/rename.sql||

  Note, the newly created column will be appended as last column, thus possibly altering the order of columns in the table.
