$ SQL Server: view

{ Creating or modifying a view

code {
create view xyz_v
as
  select …
code }

  In order to change an already existing view, on SQL Server 2016 or newer, `create or alter` can be used:
code {
create or alter view xyz_v
as
  select …
code }

  `create or alter` roughly corresponds to Oracle's `create or replace` clause.

}

{ Showing the definition of a view

  The definition of a view can be queried with → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_helptext[`sp_helptext`]:
code {
exec → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_helptext 'nameOfTheView'
code }

 `→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_helptext` returns one record for each line of the view definition.
  -
  In order to get the view definition on *one* value (one record), the definition (plus some additional information about the view characteristics) can be extracted like so:
code {
select
   definition,
   uses_ansi_nulls,
   uses_quoted_identifier,
   is_schema_bound
from
   → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sql_modules[sys.sql_modules]
where
   object_id = → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/object_id[object_id]('nameOfView');
code }


}
