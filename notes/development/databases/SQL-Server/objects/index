$ SQL Server: objects

→ development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/table[table]

{ Fully qualified object names #mssql-fully-qualified-obj-name

  A *fully qualified object name* consists of four parts: server, → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database[database],
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas[schema] and object. These are separated by a dot:
code {
select * from [hst\inst].db.sch.obj;
code }

  The indivdual parts of the fully qualified object name might be omitted from the right side:
code {
select * from [hst\inst].db.sch.obj;
select * from            db.sch.obj;
select * from               sch.obj;
select * from                   obj;
code }

  The schema part might be omitted (but still needs two dots):

code {
select * from  db..obj;
code }

}
