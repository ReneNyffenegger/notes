{ Fully qualified object names #mssql-fully-qualified-obj-name

  A *fully qualified object name* consists of four parts: server, → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database[database],
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas[schema] and object. These are separated by a dot:
code {
select * from [hst\inst].db.sch.obj;
code }

  The indivdual parts of the fully qualified object name might be omitted from the right side:
code {
select * from [hst\inst].db.sch.obj;
select * from            db.sch.obj;
select * from               sch.obj;
select * from                   obj;
code }

  The schema part might be omitted (but still needs two dots):

code {
select * from  db..obj;
code }

}

{ Showing defitions of objects #mssql-show-obj-definition

  There are a few possibilites to show an object's definition:
    • The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/object_definition[`object_definition()` function]
    • The → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/sql_modules[`sys.sql_modules` view]
    • → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/stored-procedures/sp_helptext[The `sp_helptext` system stored procedure]

}
{ Object ID

  Each object is identified by an numerical ID. This ID can be queried with
  → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/object_id[`object_id('sch.object_name')`], for example
code {
select object_id('sys.all_objects')
code }

}
{ Object definition

  Some objects (notably views or stored procedures) have a definition. This definition can be queried
  with → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/object_definition[`object_definition(@obj_id)`], for example:
code {
select object_definition(object_id('→ development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/all_objects[sys.all_objects]'));
select object_definition(object_id('sp_msForEachDB'));
code }

}
{ sys.all_objects

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/all_objects[`sys.all_objects`] shows all schema scoped user defined objects *and* system objects.

   If syn has ✓, then `create synonym` is possible for the respective type.
