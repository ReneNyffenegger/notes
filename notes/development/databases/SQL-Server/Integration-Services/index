$ SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

SSIS is an → development/Data/warehouse/ETL product.

SSIS is the successor of Data Transformation Services (DTS). (See also → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server/version/DTS/DTSWizard_exe[`DTSWizard.exe`], the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard).

The default installation directory for *Integration Services* is → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server/version/DTS[`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\_version_\DTS`].

sa:

  Integration Services run indepentently from an → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance and are therefore installed somewhere under
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server/version[`%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\version`] rather than
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server/instance-id[`%programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\INSTANCE_ID`].

  → development/databases/SQL-Server
