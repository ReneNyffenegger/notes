$ SQL Server: PolyBase
@ PolyBase

PolyBase was added to → development/databases/SQL-Server in → development/databases/SQL-Server/versions/2016[version 2016]. It then allowed to query data that was stored
in → development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS and file systems such as HortonWorks, Cloudera Azure Blob Storage using standard T-SQL queries.

→ development/databases/SQL-Server/versions/2019 extended the capabilities of PolyBase with connectors to query data from
  • SQL Server (which seems a no brainer)
  • Azure SQL DB
  • Azure SQL DW
  • Azure Cosmos DB
  • → development/databases/Oracle
  • Teradata
  • MongoDB
  • Any data source that is accessible via → development/databases/ODBC 

{ Push down optimazation

 *Push down optimazation* tries to execute most work on the source system rather than the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[SQL Server instance] because it can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted
  over the network. This notably includes operations such as
    • projections
    • → development/databases/SQL/select/join[`join` statement]
    • predicate filtering (→ development/databases/SQL/where[`where` clause] of an → development/databases/SQL/statement)
    • calulating → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by/aggregate-functions[aggregates]
    • → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/select/top-n[Top-n queries]

}
sa:
  PolyBase might render traditional → development/Data/warehouse/ETL dead because of *data virtualization*.
