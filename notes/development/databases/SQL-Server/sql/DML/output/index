$ SQL Server: output clause in DML statements

The `output` clause is used in a subset of DML statements
(→ development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/DML/insert[`insert`], 
 `delete`, `update` and `merge`) to capture the deleted or inserted values into a table or a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/data-types/table[table variable].

{ Basic demonstration

  The following *basic* demonstration tries to explain how the `output` clause might be used.
  
  { Table

    As usual with SQL examples, a table with some initial → development/Data is needed:
    gh|about-MSSQL|/sql/DML/output/simple/create-table.sql||

  }
  { Inserting a few values

    The following `insert` statement inserts additional values into the table and additionally adds the inserted values to the declared table variable as well.

    Especially note the `inserted` keyword that allows to refer to the new data:
    gh|about-MSSQL|/sql/DML/output/simple/insert.sql||

  }
  { Updating a few values

    Similarly, we're going to update some records in the table.

    Because an `update` statement has *before* and *after* values, there is no `updated` keyword, but rather both, the `deleted` and `inserted` keywords that allow to
    refer to the respective old and new values:

    gh|about-MSSQL|/sql/DML/output/simple/update.sql||

  }

}
