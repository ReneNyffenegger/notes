$ SQL Server: go

`go` is the default → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/batch[SQL batch] terminator. When used in → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd or in
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/Management-Studio, it sends the *current → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/batch[batch]* of SQL and T-SQL statements to the SQL Server for execution.

`go` is neither an → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql[SQL] nor a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL[T-SQL] statement.

In → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[sqlcmd], the batch terminator can be changed with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd#sqlcmd-c[-c option].

The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables/declare#ms-sql-variable-scope[scope] of → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/variables[Variables] ends with a `go`.


{ No effect on transactions #mssql-go-trx

  The following snippet demonstrates that `go` has no effect on → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/transaction[transactions].
