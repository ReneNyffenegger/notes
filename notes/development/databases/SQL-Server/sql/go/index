$ SQL Server: go

`go` is neither an → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql[SQL] nor a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL[T-SQL] statement.

When used in → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd or in
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/Management-Studio, it sends the *current batch* of SQL and T-SQL statements to the SQL Server for execution.

{ No effect on transactions #mssql-go-trx

  The following snippet demonstrates that `go` has no effect on → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/transaction[transactions].
