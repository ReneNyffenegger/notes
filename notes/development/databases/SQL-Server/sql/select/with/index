$ SQL Server: with (â€¦) select

{ Generate a sequence of numbers

  (Recursive) Common table expressions can be used to generate a sequence of numbers with SQL.

  The following example generates the numbers from 11 up to a maximum of 10000 in steps of 3.

  Because SQL Server puts a default limit of 100 recursions, unlimited recursions need to be enabled with `option (maxrecurion 0)`. Otherwise, we'd get
  the error message *The statement terminated. The maximum recursion 100 has been exhausted before statement completion*.
