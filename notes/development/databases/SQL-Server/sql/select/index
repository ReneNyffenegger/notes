$ SQL Server - select statement


{ Selecting into variables

code {
select
  @var = col
from
  table
where
   abc = 17049;
code }

}
{ Subqueries

  A subquery apparently needs an alias to be able to select from it.

  The following does not work:
code {
select * from (
  select 'x' eggs, 'y' why union all
  select 'X' eggs, 'Y' why
);
code }

But this does:
code {
select * from (
  select 'x' eggs, 'y' why union all
  select 'X' eggs, 'Y' why
) NOTE_THIS_ALIAS;
code }

}
{ Misc

  `select` is apparently also used to display the values of variables. (Compare with `print`).
