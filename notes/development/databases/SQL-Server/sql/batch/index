$ SQL Server: sql batch


→ development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/batch/batches-with-syntax-errors[Batches with syntax errors] and
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/batch/batches-with-logical-errors[batches with logical errors] examine
the effects of syntactical and logical errors on sql batches.


{ Some rules

  { execute statement

    If the first → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements[statement] of a batch calls a → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/procedures[stored procudure],
    the → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/execute[`execute` statement] is *not* required.

  }
  { Combining create statements

    Some object creation statements cannot be combined with other creation statement *and* need to be the *first statement* in a batch. Those are:
       • `create default`
       • `create function`
       • `create procedure`
       • `create rule`
       • `create schema`
       • `create trigger`
       • `create view `

    Note that the `create table` statement is absent from this list!

    The following works:
code {
create procedure p2 as print 'p2';
execute p2;
go
code }

   The following does not work, it throws the error message *MSG 111, Level 15, State 1… 'CREATE/ALTER PROCEDURE' must be the first statement in a query batch*:
code {
drop   procedure if exists p2;
create procedure p2 as print 'p2';
execute p2;
go
code }

   This does work again:
code {
drop   procedure if exists p2;
create procedure p2 as print 'p2';
execute p2;
go
code }

  This also works
code {
drop   procedure if exists p2;
create procedure p2 as print 'p2';
execute p2;
go
code }


  }
  { set statements

    ? The two → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/statements/set[`set` statements]
    `set showplan_text` and `set showplan_all` can only by the only statement in a batch.

  }


}

sa:

  In → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd[sqlcmd], the batch terminator can be changed with the → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd#sqlcmd-c[-c option].

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/go[`go`].
