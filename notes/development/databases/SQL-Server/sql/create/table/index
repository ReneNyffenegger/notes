$ SQL Server: create table
@ create table


{ create table … as select … from

  Apparently, SQL Server doesn't allow to create a table from a select statement with the following syntax:
code {
create table tq84_new_table as
select
  *
from
  tq84_old_table
where
  …
code }

Instead, the new table can be created with
code {
select *
  into tq84_new_table
  from tq84_old_table
where
  …
code }

}
