$ SQL Server - update statement
@ update

{ Pecularities

  Apparently, the update statement does not allow a (normal) alias for table names in SQL Server:

  gh|about-MSSQL|/sql/update/no-alias.sql||

Apparently, an alias can be given with the following special syntax (for me anyways):
code {
update t
set
  t.a    = -1
where
  t.a is null
from
  tq84_test t;
code }

where

  fnd.cgl_id      = 23432 and

  fnd.fdt_id      =        2 and -- Monthly sum

  fnd.fnd_enddate is null    and

  fnd.fnd_active  =        1

;

}
