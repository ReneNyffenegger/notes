{ Types of execution plans #mssql-exec-plan-types

  There are three types of execution plans:
  table { ll
    Estimated ☰ The plan as compiled by the → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/Query-Optimizer. This execution plan is stored in the *plan cache*.
    Actual ☰ The *actual execution plan* adds an *execution plan context* to an *estimated execution plan*. The data of an actual execution plan becomes available after the exeuction of an SQL statement has finished and then allows to compare the query optimizer's estimations with the actual run-time figures.
    Live Query Statistics ☰ The *live query statistics execution plan* is available for *in-flight query executions* and is similar to the *actual execution plan*, but allows to query the actual figures while the SQL statement is executing because the run-time information is updated every second.
  table }
