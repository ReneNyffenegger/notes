$ SQL Server: Query Optimizer
@ query optimizer

The goal of the *query optimizer* is to formulate an → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/Query-Optimizer/Execution-Plan for an → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql[SQL] statement which (hopefully) processes the
statement in the most efficient way possible.
-
In order to formulate such an execution plan, the query optimizer needs:
  • The text of the SQL statement (the «query»)
  • Schema information such as → development/databases/SQL-Server/objects/table definitions and available indexes.
  • Database statistics

The query optimizer produces an → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/Query-Optimizer/Execution-Plan#mssql-exec-plan-types[estimated execution plan] (as opposed
to an *actual* or a *live query statistics* execution plan).

sa:
  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/execution/plan[Execution plan]
