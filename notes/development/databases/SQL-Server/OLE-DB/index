$ SQL Server: OLE-DB

The → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId[PROGID] for the (official?, deprecated?) provider for → development/databases/SQL-Server is `SQLNCLI11` (*Microsoft SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider*).

{ Three generations of OLE DB providers/drivers

  Microsoft provides three distinct generations of → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB providers/drivers] for → development/databases/SQL-Server:
  table { lll
     Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server ☰ SQLOLEDB ☰ Although this generation ships with → Windows/development/MDAC#WDAC[Windows DAC], it is not maintained anymore and therefore not recommended when developping new applications.
     SQL Server Native Client  ☰ SNAC / SQLNCLI(?) ☰ This provider shipped with SQL Server 2005 (9.x) through SQL Server 2017. This provider was → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/sqlnativeclient/microsoft-is-aligning-with-odbc-for-native-relational-data-access[deprecated in 2011] and is therefore not recommended for developping new applications.
     Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server ☰ MSOLEDBSQL ☰ Apparently, this driver is the result of undeprecating SQLOLEDB. Microsoft seems to promise that this driver also includes the functionality of SQLNCLI.
  table }

  { SNAC

    SNAC is a term that interchangably referred to → development/databases/ODBC and OLE DB drivers for SQL Server.

    SNAC 10 through SNAC 13 each consisted of a single → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL.
