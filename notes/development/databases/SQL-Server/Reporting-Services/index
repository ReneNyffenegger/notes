$ SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
@ Reporting Services

SSRS require an available *SQL Server Database Engine server* to store their data in a *report server → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database*. This database is used when SSRS is running, not at installation time of SSRS.

When SSRS is installed, it creates a → Windows/services[Windows service] with display name *SQL Server Reporting Services* and service name *SQLServerReportingServices*.

{ URLs

  When SSRS is installed, it prompts for a port number where SSRS will be accessed via the web. The defalt is 80. The → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URLs] to access SSRS are
    • http://servername:port/ReportServer
    • http://servername:port/Reports/browse

}
{ Change in 2017

  ? It seems that with → development/databases/SQL-Server 2017, Reporting Services have become more indepent from SQL Server and cannot really be counted as a component anymore.

}

sa:

  The default installation location for SSRS 2017 is → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server-Reporting-Services[`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services`].

  → development/databases/SQL-Server
