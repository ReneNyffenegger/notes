abbr: Microsoft Desktop Engine

An alternative and successor to →development/databases/DAO/JET.

It is based on → development/databases/SQL-Server 7.0 but has a few restrictions.

Apparently, MSDE is not supported on Vista (and later?) - instead, using *SQL Server 2005 Express Edition* is recommended.
