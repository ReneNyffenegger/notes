$ DAO

As per → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/connect-history?view=sqlallproducts-allversions[this link], the final version of DAO is 3.6 and it won't be available on 64 bit
Windows systems. As per → https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/how-to-get-a-x64-version-of-jet/ba-p/315933[this link], however, the → Microsoft/Office team has taken up
Jet as part of → development/databases/Access and has come out with what they call the *Access Control Entry (ACE) driver*.
