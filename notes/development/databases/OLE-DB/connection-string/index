$ OLE DB: connection string
@ connection string

A *connection string* specifies how a *data store* (aka data source?) can be connected to from an OLE DB Consumer.

{ Format

  The connection string format is based on → development/databases/ODBC connection strings: it consists of key/value pairs.

  Each key/value pair is seperated from its neighbouring key/value pair by a semicolon (`;`).

  In a key/value pair, the (name of the) key is seperated from its value by an equal sign (`=`).

  A key can consist of any printable character. An equal sign needs to be escaped by another equal sign.

  Thus, a connection string looks like
code {
keyOne=valOne;keyTow=ValTwo;…
code }

}
{ Provider

  An important key is `provider`. It needs to be set to the value of an → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB provider's]
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/CLSID-OLE-DB-provider#reg-clsid-oledb-provider_VersionIndependentProgID[Version independent Prog ID] or version dependent → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId[Prog ID].

  The system automatically chooses the most recently installed provider if the version independent Prog ID is chosen.

  If the connection string is missing a `provider` key, the provider defaults to `MSDASQL` which is the OLE DB Provider for → development/databases/ODBC.

}

sa:
  → development/databases/OLE-DB
