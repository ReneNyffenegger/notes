OLE DB was/is the (→ Windows/development/COM[COM]) successor → development/databases/ODBC[ODBC]: OLE DB provides a uniform set of COM interfaces to be used by different applications.

Usually, OLEDB is used to create → development/databases[database] drivers which are then used by another database access layer such
as → development/databases/ADO[ADO] or ADO.NET. In such a constellation, OLEDB is called the *provider* and ADODB the *consumer*.
-
This is why an ADODB conection string might contain something like `provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;`.
