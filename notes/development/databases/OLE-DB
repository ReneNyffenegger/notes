OLE DB is one of the primary → Windows/development/MDAC technologies (the two others being → development/databases/ADO[ADO] and → development/databases/ODBC).

OLE DB was/is the (→ Windows/development/COM[COM]) successor of → development/databases/ODBC[ODBC]: OLE DB provides a uniform set of COM interfaces to be used by different applications.
-
Contrary to ODBC which only allows to access relational → development/databases[databases], OLE DB can also be used to access other data stores.

Usually, OLEDB is used to create → development/databases[database] drivers which are then used by another database access layer such
as → development/databases/ADO[ADO] or ADO.NET. In such a constellation, OLEDB is called the *provider* and ADODB the *consumer*.
-
This is why an ADODB conection string might contain something like `provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;`.

sa:
  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL function → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/rowset/openrowset[`openrowset`] allows to query → development/Data[data] from an OLE DB data source.

  → Windows/development/MDAC/MSDASQL is → Microsoft[Microsoft's] OLE-DB provider for → development/databases/ODBC.
