OLE DB is a → Windows/development/COM[COM] based framework that allow to transfer (tabular) → development/Data from a *data source* to a *consumer* after the consumer has «asked» for it.

OLE DB is one of the primary → Windows/development/MDAC technologies (the two others being → development/databases/ADO[ADO] and → development/databases/ODBC).

OLE DB was/is the (→ Windows/development/COM[COM]) successor of → development/databases/ODBC[ODBC]: OLE DB provides a uniform set of COM interfaces to be used by different applications.
-
Contrary to ODBC, which only allows to access relational → development/databases[databases], OLE DB can also be used to access other data stores.

Usually, OLEDB is used to create → development/databases[database] drivers which are then used by another database access layer such
as → development/databases/ADO[ADO] or ADO.NET. In such a constellation, OLEDB is called the *provider* and ADODB the *consumer*.
-
This is why an ADODB conection string might contain something like `provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;`.

{ Data source

  An *OLE DB data source* identifies a → development/databases[database] that is accessed through OLE DB.

}
{ Provider

  An *OLE DB provider* is (usually?) a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL that is able to manage and interact with a specific *data source*.

  There are providers for ordinary databases, but also for text files, spreadsheet data and other data formats.

  The (PROGID) for the (official) provider for → development/databases/SQL-Server is `SQLNCLI11` (*Microsoft SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider*).

}


sa:
  The → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL function → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL/functions/rowset/openrowset[`openrowset`] allows to query → development/Data[data] from an OLE DB data source.

  → Windows/development/MDAC/MSDASQL is → Microsoft[Microsoft's] OLE-DB provider for → development/databases/ODBC.

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin#oracle_home-bin-oledb[OLE DB related DLLs under `$ORACLE_HOME/bin`].
