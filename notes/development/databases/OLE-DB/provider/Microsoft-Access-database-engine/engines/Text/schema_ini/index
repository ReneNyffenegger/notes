{ Options

  { format

    The `format` option specifies how field values are seperated one from another. They can be separated by a specific character or by using a fixed width for each column

    The following three lines shows how to specify field values that are separated by a character (tabulator, comma, bar). `delimited=(X)` allows to specifiy an arbitrary character as delimiter (except `"`).
code {
format=tabDelimited
format=CSVDelimited
format=delimited(|)
code }

    If the columns have a fixed width, `format` needs to be set to `fixedLength`.
code {
format=fixedLength
code }

  }
  { colNameHeader #colNameHeader

   Setting `colNameHeader` to `true` specifies that a the text file has a header with the names of the data columns. Setting it to `false` indicates that there is no header at all.

   The default is taken from the
   → Windows/registry/tree-structure/value[registry value]
   → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Access-Connectivity-Engine/Engines/Text#FirstRowHasNames[`FirstRowHasNames`]
   under the
   → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key]
   → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Access-Connectivity-Engine/Engines/Text[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\Text`].

code {
colNameHeader=[true|false]
code }

  }
  { MaxScanRows

    …

  }
  { decimalSymbol

    …

  }
  { numberLeadingZeros

   `numberLeadingZeros` specifies if numbers in the range -1 through 1 have a zero to the left side of the decimal point (or more accuratly: decimal symbol).

code {
numberLeadingZeros=[true|false]
code }

  }
  { dateTimeFormat

   `dateTimeFormat` specifies the expcected format for date and time values.

    Note espacially that minutes are specified with `nn` (not `mm`)!

code {
dateTimeFormat=yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss
code }

    When a `dateTimeFormat` is missing, the format is taken from the → Windows/control-panel item → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/intl_cpl[region].

  }

}
{ Spcifying columns

   In input files where field-values are seperated by a character (that is: variable width fields), a column needs to have two valued: *column name* and its *data type*.

code {
col1=id   long 
col2=num  long
col3=flt  double
col4=txt  text
col5=dt   dateTime
code }

  It seems that column names need to be specified *even if* the → #colNameHeader option was set to true, and that the name so f the column specification overwrite the names of the header.

}
{ Comments

  Lines in a `schema.ini` can be commented with a hash sign (`#`) or a semicolon (`;`).

  The hash sign or semicolon needs to be the first non-whitespace character, otherwise, it will cause an error.
  -
  Thus, the folloign is correct:
code {
; Customer data
[customers.csv]
# cusomers is delivered with a haeder
colNameHeader=true
code }

  The following is not correct and causes an error:
code {
[customers.csv]     ; Customer data
colNameHeader=true  # cusomers is delivered with a haeder
code }

}
