$ OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Access database engine: Connection string

{ Provider

  An → development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string[connection string] for the *Microsoft Access database engine* → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB provider] needs to have the
  → development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string#ole-db-connection-string-key-provider[`Provider`] key with a value of one of
    • `Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0`
    • `Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.16.0`
    • `Microsoft.JET.OLEDB.4.0`
    •  … ?

}
{ Data Source #ace-data-source

  The second required key is `Data Source`. Its value is a → Windows/file-system path that locates the *data source* that is accessed through through the provider.

  By default, `Data Source` names an → development/databases/Access[MS Access] database file (→ development/filename-extensions#accdb[`*.accdb`]).
  -
  If the specified another document format (such as → Microsoft/Office/Excel etc.), the connection string also requires a → development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string#ole-db-connection-string-key-less-value[key-less] value to identify
  the document format. The possible values are found in the → Windows/registry under the key
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Access-Connectivity-Engine/ISAM-Formats[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\ISAM Formats`]

  The following connection string refers to an Access database:
code {
Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=P:\ath\to\access\db.accdb
code }

  The following connection string refers to a (macro-less, that is `*.xlsx`) → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] worksheet. Note the necessary `Excel 12.0` right after the `Provider=…;` part.
  -
  The connection string also requires to specifiy if the data contains a header (`HDR=Yes`):
code {
Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Excel 12.0 Xml;Data Source=P:\ath\to\excel\worksheet.xlsx;HDR=Yes
code }

}
{ TODO

  { IMEX

    The extended attribute `IMEX` (seen for a connection to Excel) stands for *Import-Export Module* and can probably be set to apparently be set to `0`, `1` or `2`.

    As per → https://www.connectionstrings.com/excel/[this website], setting IMEX to 1 tells the driver to read all («intermixed»?) columns as text.
    -
    This website also claims that setting IMEX to 0 forces *TypeGuessRows=0*.

    When set to `1` or `2`, a Workbook cannot be created.
