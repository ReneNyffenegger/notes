$ Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Access database engine

{ Download Microsoft Access databases engine 2010

   This → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider can be downloaded from → https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255
   -
   The link allows to download either or both of `AccessDatabaseEngine.exe` and `AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe`.

   When `AccessDatabaseEngine_X64` is executed, it installs (among others?)
   → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Common-Files/microsoft-shared/OFFICEn/ACEOLEDB_DLL[`ACEOLEDB.DLL`] (in → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Common-Files/microsoft-shared/OFFICEn[`%CommonProgramFiles%\microsoft shared\OFFICEn`])
   and `STSLIST.DLL` (in → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-Office[`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14`])

   After installing, this provider can then be removed again by deinstalling *Microsoft Access database engine 2010*.
