$ C-Sharp program to test OLE DB connection strings for Excel 

The → development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] program that is presented here tries to connect to an → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] worksheet With → Microsoft/dot-net/ADO and a series of
→ development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string[OLE DB connection strings].

I wrote this program because it *seems* that there is no official documentation on the format of such connection strings. Even after searching multiple times, I didn't find a satisfying page on the internet or
microsoft.com.

The program contains a `private` string array, `connectionStringTemplates`, over which the program iterates. In each iteration, the substring `XLSXPATH` is replaced with the file path of an Excel Worksheet.
with the resulting connection string (variable `connectionString`), the program tries to establish a connection to the worksheet.

If this is possible, it acknowledges it with `OK`, otherwise, it prints the caught exception.
