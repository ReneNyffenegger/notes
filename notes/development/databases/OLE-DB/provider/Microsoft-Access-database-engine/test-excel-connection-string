$ C-Sharp program to test OLE DB connection strings for Excel 

The → development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] program that is presented here tries to connect to an → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] worksheet With → Microsoft/dot-net/ADO and a series of
→ development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string[OLE DB connection strings].

I wrote this program because it *seems* that there is no official documentation on the format of such connection strings. Even after searching multiple times, I didn't find a satisfying page on the internet or
microsoft.com.

The program contains a `private` string array, `connectionStringTemplates`, over which the program iterates. In each iteration, the substring `XLSXPATH` is replaced with the file path of an Excel Worksheet.
with the resulting connection string (variable `connectionString`), the program tries to establish a connection to the worksheet.

If this is possible, it acknowledges it with `OK`, otherwise, it prints the caught exception.

    Microsoft has the following → https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/278973[comment] about *data types*:
    "
       Unlike a traditional database, there is no direct way to specify the
       data types for columns in Excel tables. Instead, the OLE DB provider
       scans a limited number of rows in a column to "guess" the data type for
       the field. The number of rows to scan defaults to eight (8) rows; you
       can change the number of rows to scan by specifying a value between one
       (1) and sixteen (16) for the MAXSCANROWS setting in the extended
       properties of your connection string.
