ODBC is one of the primary → Windows/development/MDAC technologies (the two others being → development/databases/ADO[ADO] and → development/databases/OLE-DB).

With ODBC, only relational → development/databases[databases] can be accessed.

A follow-up API to ODBC was/is → development/databases/OLE-DB[OLEDB].

{ OLE DB Provider for ODBC

  The → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB provider] for ODBC is `MSDASQL`. It is implemented in
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Common-Files/System/ole-db/msdasql_dll[`%CommonProgramFiles%\System\ole db\msdasql.dll`].

  The OLE DB provider for ODBC is primarly meant to be used as a workaround for OLE DB applications that need to access data sources for which no OLE DB provider, but an ODCB driver, exists.

  If an → development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string[OLE DB connection string] is missing the `provider` key, the system defaults to this  *Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers* (or short: «MSDASQL»).

  The → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/CLSID-OLE-DB-provider[CLSID] of `MSDASQL` is `{C8B522CB-5CF3-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D}`.

  a list of installed ODBC drivers.
