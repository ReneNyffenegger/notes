NoSQL = not only SQL.

NoSQL systems provide → development/databases/common/CRUD operations, sometimes(?) without the overload of → development/databases/common/ACID properties.

→ development/Data[Data] is not necessarily stored in 2 dimensional tables as they are in common → development/databases/DBMS/RDMBS.
