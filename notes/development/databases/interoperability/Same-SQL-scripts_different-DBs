$ Running the same SQL script on different DBs

At times, I find myself in need to run the same SQL script in different → development/databases[database] products. Because these databases
have dfferent → development/databases/SQL[SQL] dialects, there needs to be some kind of *if db = mysql then … else … end* logic in the scripts.

For example, → development/databases/MySQL[MySQL] starts a → development/databases/SQL/transaction[transaction] with `begin work` while
→ development/databases/SQLite[SQLite] starts it with `begin transaction`.

Solving such a requirement is easily possible if there is a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor] and the scripts can be run from the command line.
-
This is demonstrated with the following relevant porition of the SQL script:
code {
…
#ifdef MYSQL
  begin work;
#elif defined SQLITE
  begin transaction;
#endif
…
code }

Now, to execute the script in MySQL, the preprocessor needs to be started with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[`-E`] flag (so that
neither the compiler nor the linker will be invoked) and the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/P_uppercase[`-P`] flag (so that the
command line markers are excluded from the output).
-
Additionally, the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/D_[`-D`] flag is used to specify the database environment.

With all that said, the script is executed for MySQL like so
code {
$ → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] -E -P -DMYSQL  | mysql -u rene
code }

And similarly for SQLite with
code {
$ → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] -E -P -DSQLITE | sqlite db
code }
