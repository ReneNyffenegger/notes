$ Database: backup and recovery

*Backup and recovery* deals with concepts, procedures, and strategies that are needed to protect a
→ development/databases[database] against data loss.
-
such data loss can be caused by media failure or user errors.

A ~backup~ is basically a copy of the → development/Data that is stored in the database and the necessary → development/Data/metadata (such as configuration files) that are needed to run and operate the database.

~Recovery~ encompasses all steps that are needed to reconstruct an operationg database after a media failure (or user error).
