$ Database: backup and recovery

*Backup and recovery* deals with concepts, procedures, and strategies that are needed to protect a
→ development/databases[database] against data loss.
-
Such data loss can be caused by media failure or user errors.
 
A *media failure* occurs when it is not possible anymore to read or write a file, typically because of *disk head crashes*.
 
*User errors* seem to be way more common: someone accidentally dropps a table or performs bad → development/databases/SQL/DML[DML statements].
-
Some sources even state that user errors are the greates single cause of database downtime.

A ~backup~ is basically a copy of the → development/Data that is stored in the database and the necessary → development/Data/metadata (such as configuration files) that are needed to run and operate the database.

~Recovery~ encompasses all steps that are needed to reconstruct an operating database after a media failure (or user error).

A well planed backup and recovery strategy enables to return a corrupted database to desired state with minimum impact and minimum DBA effort.
