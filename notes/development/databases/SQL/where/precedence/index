$ SQL precedence (AND, OR)

In most → development/databases/DBMS/RDMBS[RDMBS] (all?), `and` has a higher precedence than `or` when used in a → development/databases/SQL/where[`where` clause].
-
Because of this precedence rule, `and` conditions are evaluated *before* `or` conditions.

`where` condition is true:
code {
select count(*) from …
where
   1 = 1            or
   1 = 2 and 1 = 3
;
code }

`where` condition is false
code {
select count(*) from …
where
   1 = 0            or
   1 = 1 and 1 = 3
;
code }
