$ SQL: null values

The → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard] defines a special *null* value for every → development/databases/SQL/data-types[data type].
-
This implies that it is impossible to determine the data type of a null value.

The null value is specifically used for *unknown* → development/Data. This implies that it is neither equal nor different to any other value, including another null value.

Although a null value is different from every other null value, in a → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[`group by` aggregation], they form *one* group.

This null value might be denoted by the keyword `null`.

→ misc/ISO/9075/F383[SQL Standard feature F383] specifies a *set column `not null` clause* which, if used, prohibits inserting a null value into that column.

{ Misc

  → development/databases/Oracle considers the empty string to be `null`.
