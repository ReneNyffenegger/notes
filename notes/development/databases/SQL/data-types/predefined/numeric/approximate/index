$ SQL data type: approximate numeric 

The → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard] previsions three  approximate numeric data types:
  • `float(n)`
  • `real`
  • `double precision`

The *precistion* of `real` is implementation defined.
For example, in → development/databases/SQL-Server, `real` is a synonym for `float(24)`.

For *most* numbers, an approximate numeric data type stores an approximation of the number to be stored.
Because the stored value is only an approximation of a value, this data type is problematic in → development/databases/SQL/where[`where`] conditions when the `=` or `<>` operator is used.
