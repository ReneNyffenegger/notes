$ SQL data type: datetime

The *datetime* → development/databases/SQL/data-types[data type] comes in three variants:
  • `timestamp`
  • `time` (to specify a time, but not a date - hours, minutes, seconds)
  • `date` (used for dates of the *Gregorian calendar*: year, month, day)

The `timestamp` and `time` data types allow to increase the precision with a number of decimal digits for seconds.
-
These two data types may also be combined with a → misc/ISO/8601#iso-8601-time-zone[time zone].
