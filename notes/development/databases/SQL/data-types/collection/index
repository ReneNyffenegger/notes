$ SQL: collection types

SQL defines two *collection types*:
   • *arrays* (Introduced with → misc/ISO/9075#sql-1999[SQL:1999])
   • *multisets* (Introduced with → misc/ISO/9075#sql-2003[SQL:2003])

Arrays contain an *ordered* set of elements while multiset contain an *unordered* set of elements.
-
A multiset can contain the same element multiple times.

These collection types are used to store a *homogenous* collection of elements (that is: every element has the same
→ development/databases/SQL/data-types[data type]).

The number of elements in an array can be determined with the `cardinality` function.
-
Starting with → misc/ISO/9075#sql-2011[SQL:2011], the maximum number of elements that can be stored can be set wtih `array_max_cardinality`.

SQL:2011 also introduced `trim_array` which can be used to remove elements from the end of an array.
