$ SQL: drop table

The purpose of the `drop table` statement is to destroy a → development/databases/SQL/table[table].

code {
DROP TABLE tab;
code }

{ if exists

  Some RDBMS have the extension `if exists` to the `drop table` statement in which case no error message is produced if a table does not exist.
  
  Among these are
    • → development/databases/MySQL
    • → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/drop/table[SQL Server]
    • → development/databases/SQLite/tables/drop[SQLite]

  In contrast, → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[Oracle SQL] does not have such a clause (18c).
