$ History of SQL 

In the 1970's, a hot topic in computer science was *persistent → development/Data[data]*.
-
Codasyl Data Base Task Group proposed a → development/databases[database] language (apparantly called *DBTG*).

Codd conceived two relational languages: *Relational Algebra* and *Relational Calculus*. Among others, Relational
Calculus introduced a few interesting operators:
  
  • ∀ : for all
  • ∃ : there exists
  • π : project
  • σ : select
  • ρ : rename
  • ⨝ : join
-
These concepts allowed to formulate complex *queries*, however, they were academic in nature and difficult to enter
on a → /hardware/keyboard[keyboard]. Thus, Ray Boyce and Donald Chamberlin tried to create a language that was
better suited to express Codd's ideas for users. They first developed *Square* and then *Sequel*.

Sequel had no (greek or other) symbols and was generally way more readable. Boyce and Chamberlin wrote two papers:
  • SEQUEL: A Structured English Query Language
  • Using a Structured English Query Language as a Data Definition Language

The first paper became widely known.

-
Chamberlin writes about this time
"
  Ray and I hoped that, with a little practice,
  users could learn to read queries like this almost as though they were English prose.
"

Sequel was declarative rather than procedural.

Sequel evolved further within the *System R project*.

In 1977, the name Sequel was changed to → development/databases/SQL[SQL].

In the late 1970's and early 1980's, → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle] and IBM began to commercially implement SQL.

1986, the first → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard (ISO 9075)] was available, with more to follow.
