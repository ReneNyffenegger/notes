$ History of SQL 

In the 1970's, a hot topic in computer science was *persistent → development/Data[data]*.
-
→ development/languages/CODASYL[Codasyl] Data Base Task Group proposed a → development/databases[database] language (apparently called *DBTG*).

Codd conceived two relational languages: *Relational Algebra* and *Relational Calculus*. Among others, Relational
Calculus introduced a few interesting operators:
  • ∀ : for all
  • ∃ : there exists
  • π : project
  • σ : select
  • ρ : rename
  • ⨝ : join
-
These concepts allowed to formulate complex *queries*, however, they were academic in nature and difficult to enter
on a → hardware/keyboard[keyboard]. Thus, Ray Boyce and Donald Chamberlin tried to create a language that was
better suited to express Codd's ideas for users. They first developed *Square* and then *Sequel*.

Sequel had no (greek or other) symbols and was generally way more readable. Boyce and Chamberlin wrote two papers:
  • → development/databases/SQL/history/SEQUEL
  • Using a Structured English Query Language as a Data Definition Language

The first paper became widely known.

Chamberlin writes about this time
"
  Ray and I hoped that, with a little practice,
  users could learn to read queries like this almost as though they were English prose.
"

Sequel was declarative rather than procedural.

Sequel evolved further within the *System R project*.

In 1977, the name Sequel was changed to → development/databases/SQL[SQL].

In 1979, Larry Ellison and Bob Miner founded *Relational Software, Inc. (RSI)*. This company developed the first commercially viable implementation of of Codd's model with SQL. The product was sold
as *Oracle V.2* and was effectively the world's first relational database.

In the early 1980, IBM also began to commercially implement SQL.

1986, the first → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard (ISO 9075)] was available, with more to follow.
