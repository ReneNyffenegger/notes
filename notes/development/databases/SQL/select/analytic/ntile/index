$ SQL: NTILE

`ntile(n) over (order by val)` allows to partition an SQL result set into `n` groups of (approximatively) equal numbers of records.

The returned value of `ntile` is an integer between `1` and `n` which indicates the group number into which a record belongs.
-
The group number that the record falls into is determined by the `order by val` clause: the lower `val` is, the lower the assigned group is.

I try to demonstrate that behaviour with the following simple example.

First, I need to have a table …
gh|about-SQL|/select/analytic/ntile/create-table.sql||

… into which I insert some → development/Data[data]:
gh|about-SQL|/select/analytic/ntile/insert-values.sql||

I now want to create the inserted fruits into three groups: the cheapest (group `1`), the
medium priced (group `2`) and the expensive ones (group `3`).
-
Also, within a group, I want to order the records by the fruit (as opposed to their value):
gh|about-SQL|/select/analytic/ntile/select-ntile.sql||

The query returns
code {
group_no item        val     
-------- ----------- ------- 
1        Banana      1.21    
1        Papaya      0.98    
1        Pineapple   2.14    
2        Guava       5.08    
2        Mango       3.84    
2        Mosumbi     4.78    
3        Jack Fruit  8.32    
3        Orange      5.63    
code }

  In the → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard], `ntile` is described in → misc/ISO/9075/features[feature] T614.
