$ SQL: Using LAG and LEAD to calculate the from and to coordinates of cells in a grid

Usually, → development/databases/SQL/select/analytic/lag-lead[the `LEAD` and `LAG` analytic functions] are used one-dimensionally.

At times, there is a need to calculate the «next» value in more dimensions, notably, if we're given (x and y) coordinate values in a two-dimensional plane and we need to calculate
the grid's cells' from and to coordinates.

The following example is an attempt to demonstrate how this might be achieved with an → development/databases/SQL[SQL] statement.
