$ SQL: select first row only

Different database products have different SQL clauses to select the first row only. 
-
→ development/databases/Oracle 12c has the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows#ora-sql-row-limiting-clause[row limiting clause].
-
→ development/databases/SQLite has the → development/databases/SQLite/sql/select/limit[limit clause]. Apparently, mySql also comes with a limit clause.
-
→ development/databases/SQL-Server has the → development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/select/top-n[top n clause].
