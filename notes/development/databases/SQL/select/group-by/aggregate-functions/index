$ SQL: aggregate functions

Aggregate functions can be used if either
  • all (non analytical) selected columns consist of aggregate functions, or
  • there is a → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] statement.


{ Aggregate functions with KEEP

  Some aggregate functions can be followed by the keyword `KEEP`:
code {
max(expr) KEEP (dense_rank first order by anotherExpr).
code }

  Such a construct still needs to be considered an aggregate function.

  However, if this construct is followed by `OVER`, it turns in an *analytic function*, as in «normal» cases as well.
