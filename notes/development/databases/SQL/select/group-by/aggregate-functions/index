$ SQL: aggregate functions

Aggregate functions can be used if either
  • all (non analytical) selected columns consist of aggregate functions, or
  • there is a → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] statement.

The → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard] defines five aggregate functions:
  • `min`, `max`
  • `count`
  • `sum`
  • `avg`

RDBMS Vendors might provide additional aggregate functions, such as
  • `group_concat(…``, `list_agg(…)`
  • `stddev(…)`, `variance(…)`

{ HAVING clause

  Values that are produced by an aggregate functions can be filtered from the result set with the `having` clause (not
  the `where` clause).

}
{ Aggregate functions with KEEP

  Some aggregate functions can be followed by the keyword `KEEP`:
code {
max(expr) KEEP (dense_rank first order by anotherExpr).
code }

  Such a construct still needs to be considered an aggregate function.

  However, if this construct is followed by `OVER`, it turns in an *analytic function*, as in «normal» cases as well.
