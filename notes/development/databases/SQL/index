$ SQL
abbr: Structured Query Language

SQL is a name, not an acryonym. It might stand for *SQL Query Language*, however :-).

SQL is a declarative, textual query language for relational databases.
-
It combines querying, updating and administrative instructions into a single language.
-
The administrative instructions allow to change the properties of a → development/databases[database] while it is running.


{ Implementations

  → development/databases/Oracle/SQL[Oracle]

  → Companies-Products/SAS[SAS'] propretiary implementation of SQL (Ansi 1999) is ~FedSQL~.

  → development/databases/Access/SQL[Access]


}
{ NULL values

  SQL has a »`null` value«. A data-item whose value is `null` indicates that either the correct value for this item is unknown or not applicable.

  Any standard operator comparisons (`=`, `<>` etc.) with `null` values are false. In order to check for null values, the special `is null` operator is needed.
  -
  This gives raise to a *three-valued logic*. (Rule number 3 of Codd's *twelve rules*).

}
{ TODO

  → https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki[sqllogictest] is a program designed to verify that an SQL database engine computes correct results by comparing the results
  to identical queries from other SQL database engines.

  The → development/languages/R[R] package → development/languages/R/packages/sqldf[`sqldf`] allows to manipuate
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[R data frames] with SQL.
  -
  The package → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr[`dplyr`] has also some functionality that remind me of SQL.
