$ SQL: Isolation level

{ SQL-99 standard #sql-iso-lvl-4


  Depending on a transaction's currenty isolation level, some phenomena when reading data are possible or not possible:
  table { ll
    Dirty read ☰ A transaction (T1) reads data that was inserted or modified by another transaction (T2), but is not yet committed by T2. This read is dirty because if T2 decides to rollback a change, T1 works with data that must be considered inexisting.
    Non-repeatable read ☰ A transaction reads some twice. When reading it the second time, the reader discovers that the data was modified or deleted (and committed) in the meantime by another transaction. Such a read is called non-repeatable (and somtimes also «fuzzy»), because the same `select` statement is not guaranteed to return the same data in the same transaction.
    Phantom read ☰ A transaction formulates a criteria to read data and uses this criteria to read data twice. With a phantom read, more data is returned the second time (but unlike in a fuzzy read, the existing records didn't change). This phenomenon is called phantom read because the new records seem to have a phantom origin. A phantom read is thus a special case of a non-repeatable read.
  table }

  The → misc/ISO/9075#sql-1999[SQL-99] standard mentions 4 *transaction isolation levels* (ordered from lowest to highest amount of consistency and protection) which define which of these phenomenons are possible:
  table { llll

   ~Isolation level~ ☰ ~Dirty read~ ☰ ~non-repeatable read~ ☰ ~Phantom read~
    Read uncommitted ☰ Possible ☰ Possible ☰ Possible
    Read comitted ☰ Prevented ☰ Possible ☰ Possible
    Repeatable read ☰ Prevented ☰ Prevented ☰ Possible
    Serializable ☰ Prevented ☰ Prevented ☰ Prevented

  table }

  Read commited is the default isolation level.
