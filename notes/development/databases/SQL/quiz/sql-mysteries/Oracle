$ sql-mysteries for Oracle

*sql-mysteries for Oracle* is a port of the → development/databases/SQLite database → https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries[sql-mysteries] to Oracle.

sql-mysteries is an → development/databases/SQL quiz that is meant to practise SQL skills.

I ported this SQL quiz to Oracle because I liked the idea and found it to be an engaging and effective tool for practicing SQL skills when I am teaching SQL (which I usually do for Oracle).

This port is hosted on → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle[github].

The repository consists of the following three main shell scripts (which must be executed in order):
table { ll
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/01-get-original-data.sh[`01-get-original-data.sh`] ☰ Clones the original github repository and creates CSV files from the SQLite database.
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/02-load-data.sh[`02-load-data.sh`] ☰ Uses SQL*Loader to load the CSV files into an Oracle database.
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/03-dump-insert-statements.sh[`03-dump-insert-statemehts.sh`] ☰ Creates SQL files which load the data into a database. Meant for environments where SQL*Loader is not readily available. These «insert» scripts and a script that creates the tables can be downloaded from → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/releases/download/v0.9.0/sql-mysteries.zip[this zip file].
