$ sql-mysteries for Oracle

→ https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries[sql-mysteries] is an → development/databases/SQL quiz, developped for an → development/databases/SQLite database,
that is meant to practise SQL skills.

*sql-mysteries for Oracle* is a port of this SQLite database to Oracle.

{ Instructions

  The instructions are essentially the same as those of described in the → https://mystery.knightlab.com/walkthrough.html[walkthrough of the original]:

  A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave
  you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember
  that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on
  Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City.

  Your ~first step~ to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report
  from the police department’s database.

  All the clues to this mystery are buried in the database's tables, and you need to
  use SQL to navigate through this vast network of information.

{ Scripts to create the database

  The database and the release files are created with the following three shell scripts (which must be executed in order):
table { ll
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/01-get-original-data.sh[`01-get-original-data.sh`] ☰ Clones the original github repository and creates → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV files from the SQLite database.
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/02-load-data.sh[`02-load-data.sh`] ☰ Creates the `sql_myseries` schema (→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/load-data/create-schema.sql[`load-data/create-schema.sql`]) and the required tables (→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/load-data/create-tables.sql[`load-data/create-tables.sql`]). Then uses → development/databases/Oracle/tools/sql-loader to load the CSV files into the `sql_mysteries` tables.
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/blob/master/03-dump-insert-statements.sh[`03-dump-insert-statements.sh`] ☰ Creates SQL files (scripts) containing `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/DML/insert` statements  to load the data into another database. Meant for environments where SQL*Loader is not readily available. The result of this step (these `insert` scripts and `create-tables.sql`) can be downloaded from → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/sql-mysteries-for-Oracle/releases/download/v0.9.0/sql-mysteries.zip[this zip file].
