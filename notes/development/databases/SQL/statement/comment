$ SQL: comments

The → misc/ISO/9075[SQL standard] defines two kinds of comments:
  • *Simple comments* (→ misc/ISO/9075/features[Feature] E161) and
  • *Bracketed comments* (Feature T351)


A ~simple comment~ starts with two hyphens (`--`) and extends to the next → development/line-break[new line] or end of statement, whichever is first.

A ~Bracketed comment~ starts with a `/*` and extends to the next `*/`.

In a comment that is introduced by a `--`, the `/*` is not recognized as a comment introducer.
-
Similarly, within `/* … */` the `--` does not comment out a the `*/`.

The following snippet tries to demonstrate all combinations. `T` is SQL text, `c` is comment:
code {
TTT TTTT TT -- ccc ccc

TTT /* cc ccc
cc cccc
-- */ ccc ccc
ccc */ TTT

/* ccc ccc
ccc 
ccc -- */ TTT

-- /* ccc ccc
TTT TTTT
TTT -- */ ccc
code }

With these rules, its possible to comment out or in a block of code while testing SQL statements with just two hyphens as is is shown below:
code {
-- /*
This text is not a comment.
By just removing the two hyphens
at the beginning, it turns
into a comment.
-- */
code }

{ Misc

  The statement parser considers comments to be equivalent to → development/line-break[new lines].

  I *believe* that the standard can be interpreted to mean that bracketed comments can be nested.

}

sa:
  In → development/databases/MySQL#mysql-comments[MySQL], comments can also be introduced with a `#`. Additionally, it seems that `--` needs to be followed by a space to be recognized as a comment.
