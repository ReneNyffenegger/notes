$ SQL: Order of select operations

The order is:
table { ll
  `from` ☰  to generate the *data set*
  `on` / `join` ☰
  `where` ☰  to filter interesting records from the *data set*
  *Add pseudo column `rownum`* ☰ → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle] only (See → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows[Select first n rows …])
  → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[`group by`] ☰ To specify which rows need to be combined for aggregations 
  `with cube` / `with rollup` ☰ 
  → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by/aggregate-functions[aggregation functions] ☰ to actually perform the calculations on the combined rows
  `having` ☰ To exclude (aggregated) records
   → development/databases/SQL/select/analytic[Window (analytic)] functions ☰ to combine values from different records of the result set
   → development/databases/SQL/select[`select`] ☰ Specify what is actually returned.
  `distinct` ☰ eliminate duplicates
  `union`, `intersect`, `except` ☰ to combine results from multiple select statements
   → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model[Model clause] ☰ → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/model[Oracle] only?
  `→ development/databases/SQL/select/order-by` ☰ to sort the result set
  `offset` ☰  to specify the first record that should be returned
  `limit`, `fetch`, `top` ☰ to specify how many records should be returned
table }

Because *aggregation functions* are performed after `group by`, they cannot appear in `group by` expressions.

Because window functions are performed after aggregation functions, they can use the result of aggregation functions.

Because column aliases are defined in the `select` step, they cannot be used in preceding steps (such as the `where` clause etc.)

An example that combines → development/databases/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`] and `union all` is → development/databases/SQL/operation-order/union-all_order-by[here].
