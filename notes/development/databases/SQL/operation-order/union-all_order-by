$ SQL: order of operations - union all / order by

{ Ordering the entire result set

  Because in the → development/databases/SQL/operation-order[SQL order of operation], the → development/databases/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`] is performed after
  a `union all` the following select statement returns *all* records ordered by `id`, not just the records of `tq84_tab_2`.

  gh|about-SQL|/select/order-of-operations/union-all_order-by/select-1.sql||

  Note: → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle] 18c is not able to process this query, it fails with *ORA-00904: "ID": invalid identifier*.

  I was able to run it on
  → development/databases/SQL-Server[SQL Server],
  → development/databases/MySQL[MySQL] and
  → development/databases/SQLite[SQLite],
  though.

}
{ Apply order by first, then combine result set

  { First attempt

    The following example puts the → development/databases/SQL/select[`select`] statements with the `order by` clauses within parentheses so that the
    the records of `tq84_tab_1` are ordered indepentently from those of `tq84_tab_2`. Additionally, the records of `tq84_tab_1` are returned first, *then*
    the records of `tq84_tab_2`.

    gh|about-SQL|/select/order-of-operations/union-all_order-by/select-1.sql||

    Unfortunately, I was only able to execute this query without errors on MySQL.
    -
    Oracle failed with *ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis*,
    SQL Server with *Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'order'.* and
    SQLite with *Result: near "(": syntax error*.

  }
  { Using subqueries

    The `order by` clause might be put into a *subquery* in order to achieve the same result on Oracle 18c, MySQL and SQLite.

    gh|about-SQL|/select/order-of-operations/union-all_order-by/select-subquery.sql||

    SQL Server complains with *The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP, OFFSET or FOR XML is also specified.*.

  }
  { Using an additional column

    In order to *finally* make the desired ordering possible in SQL Server, too, an additional column might be added to the `select` statements: 
      
    gh|about-SQL|/select/order-of-operations/union-all_order-by/select-additional-col.sql||

    This also works with SQLite and MySQL, but Oracle fails with *ORA-00904: "ID": invalid identifier*.
