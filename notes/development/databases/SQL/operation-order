$ SQL: Order of operaions

The order is:
  • `from`
  • `where`
  • `group by`
  •  aggregation functions
  • `having`
  •  Window (analyitic) functions
  • `select`
  • `distinct`
  • `union`, `intersect`, `except`
  • `order by`
  • `offset`
  • `limit`, `fetch`, `top`

Because *aggregation functions* are performed after `group by`, they cannot appear in `group by` expressions.

Because window functions are performed after aggregation functions, they can use the result of aggregation functions.
