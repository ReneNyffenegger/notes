$ SQL: Order of select operations

The order is:
table { ll
  `from` ☰  to generate the *data set*
  `where` ☰  to filter interesting records from the *data set*
  `group by` ☰ To specify which rows need to be combined for aggregations 
   aggregation functions ☰ to actually perform the calculations on the combined rows
  `having` ☰ To exclude (aggregated) records
   Window (analyitic) functions ☰ to combine values from different records of the result set
  `select` ☰ to specify what is actually returned
  `distinct` ☰ eliminate duplicates
  `union`, `intersect`, `except` ☰ to combine results from multiple select statements
   Model clause ☰ → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle] only(?)
  `order by` ☰ to sort the result set
  `offset` ☰  to specify the first record that should be returned
  `limit`, `fetch`, `top` ☰ to specify how many records should be returnd
table }

Because *aggregation functions* are performed after `group by`, they cannot appear in `group by` expressions.

Because window functions are performed after aggregation functions, they can use the result of aggregation functions.
