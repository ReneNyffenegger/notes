{ Create a new table with a select statement

The equivalent of other databases' `create table NewTable as select * from ...` is
code {
select *
into   NewTable
from   ...
code }

}

{ Referencing tables in other formats

  { Tables in another Access file
  
    Tables in another access database can be referenced with `[access-path].[tablename]` which allows, for
    example to insert into a table in another access (accdb) file:
  
  code {
  insert into
  [X:\path\to\backend.accdb].[TheTableName]
  (x, y, z)
  values
  (1, 42, 99)
  code }
  
  }
  
  { Data in Excel
  
    Similarly, a worksheet can be referenced as a table with `[Excel 8.0;HDR=yes;DATABASE=\path\to\xlsx].[Worksheet Name$]`.
  
    Of course, if the data has no header, you will set `HDR=no`.
  
    Note the trailing `$` after the sheet name. If there were a named range in the excel sheet, the name of the
    range can be stated after the `$`. If the entire sheet has to be used, the `$` still needs to be present.
  
  code {
  insert into someTable
  select * from [Excel 8.0;HDR=yes;DATABSE=x:\path\to\the.xlsx].[worksheet name$]
  code }
  
  }

  { CSV files

code {
insert into someTabel
select *
from [TEXT;HDR=yes;DATABASE=x:\path\to\Directory\Containing\CSV].[fileName.csv]
code }

  }

}

{ Date related

  Creating a `date`:
code {
dateSerial(year, month, day)
code }

}
