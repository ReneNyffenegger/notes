$ Access: joins

{ Joining multiple tables

  → development/databases/Access[Access] requires parentheses to join more then two tables. In fact, in order to join `n` tables, `n-2` pairs of parentheses are needed.

code {
select
  … 
from  (((
   table_one    t1                           inner join
   table_two    t2 on t2.one_id    = t1.id ) inner join
   table_three  t3 on t3.two_id    = t2.id ) inner join
   table_four   t4 on t4.three_id  = t3.id ) inner join
   table_five   t5 on t5.four_id   = t4.id
where
   …
;
code }

}

{ Outer joins

  
  If a condition is applied to the outer-joined table, the condition must be put into parentheses:
code {
select
   …
from
   table_one    t1                                               left outer join
   table_two    t2 on ( t1.id = t2.id and t2.criteria = 'xyz' )
code }


}
{ Maximum number of tables

  The maximum number of tables that can be joined is 16 (→ https://support.office.com/en-us/article/access-specifications-0cf3c66f-9cf2-4e32-9568-98c1025bb47c[as of MS-Access 2019]).
