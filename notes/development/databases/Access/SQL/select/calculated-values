$ MS Access SQL: select statement with calculated values

A somewhat nice feature of Access SQL is that it allows to use a *calculated value* to calculated another value in a select statement.

The example prints
code {
 a b c d | a+b  a+b+c  a+b+c+d
---------+--------------------
 1 1 1 1 |   2      3        4
 1 1 2 4 |   2      4        8
 3 1 0 1 |   4      4        5
code }

Unfortunately, the alias of a calculated doesn't seem to be able to be used in a `order by` clause.
