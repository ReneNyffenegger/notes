$ Access SQL: Ordering on a function that returns a date or null

When I tried to order by the returned value of a function that returns either a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] or
→ development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-null[null], it turned out that apparently Access converts the date to a
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string] which messed up the desired ordering.

In order to correctly order the result set, I had to `order by → development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion/cDate[cDate](nz(expr, #9999-31-12#))`.
