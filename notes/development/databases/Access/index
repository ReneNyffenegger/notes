Access (like → development/databases/SQLite) stores everything that belongs to a database solution in a single file, typically with the → development/filename-extensions[extension] `.accdb`.
This approach allows to easily deploy a database by just copying the `*.accdb` file to the computer where it is needed. Unlike SQLIte, however, an `*.accdb` not only stores data but also
reports and UI elements.

{ Office Access Connectivity Engine (ACE) #ace

  Before Access 2007, the default database engine was →development/databases/DAO/JET. With Access 2007, →Microsoft introduced(?)
  the *Office Access Connectivity Engine* (fileformat: `.accdb`).

  Because JET is deprecated and not even available for 64-bit Windows, the Access development team decided to copy the JET source and adapt it for their own purposes
 (See → https://web.archive.org/web/20091219195757/http://blogs.msdn.com/access/archive/2005/10/13/480870.aspx[Access 12's new data engine] for more details).

  As per → https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/how-to-get-a-x64-version-of-jet/ba-p/315933[this link], this copied engine was given the odd name *Access Control Entry*. However, I *believe*
  ACE stands for *Access Connectivity Engine*.

  Apparently, ACE is fully backward compatible to JET.

  As far as I understand it, ACE can be installed without → Microsoft/Office using → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider/Microsoft-Access-database-engine[Microsoft Access Database Engine].
