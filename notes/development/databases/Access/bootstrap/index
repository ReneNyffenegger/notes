$ MS Access bootstrap - Create Access projects programmatically

This light weight → development/languages/VBScript scriptlet can be used to programmatically bootstrap the creation
of → development/databases/Access[MS Access] applications.

When it is inovoked, it needs three parameters:
  • The path (inclusive filename) of the `accdb` to be created
  • The path (without filename) to the VBA → development/languages/VBA/modules/Common/00_ModuleLoader[00_ModuleLoader.bas] module, which is used to load further VBA modules.
  • The path (inclusive filename) of an *init module* that must have a `createApp` → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[`sub`] which will be called after inserting both modules.
