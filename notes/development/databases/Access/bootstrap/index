$ MS Access bootstrap - Create Access projects programmatically

`accessBootstrap.vbs` is a light-weight → development/languages/VBScript scriptlet that can be used to programmatically bootstrap the creation
of → development/databases/Access[MS Access] applications.


{ accessBootstrap.vbs

   Currently, `accessBootstrap.vbs` exhibits three functions:
     • `createDB`: to create the access (`.accdb`) file. The sub takes a string that contains the path plus filename of the resulting file.
     • `insertModule`: to insert a → development/languages/VBA[VBA] → development/languages/VBA/language/module[module]
     • `addReference`: to add a reference to a *type lib* (see → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model#vbe-add-reference[here]).

{ Test

  { The wsf file

    The following WSF file (Windows Script File, to be run with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cscript_exe[`cscript.exe`]) uses `accessBootstrap.vbs` to insert a → development/languages/VBA/language/module[VBA module] and then call a
    → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub] (`createApplication`) in the inserted module.
    -
    In a real world case, `createApplication` would then create the Access application.

  { The inserted VBA module

    The (simple) inserted module with the `createApplication` sub that is called by the wsf file (via `accessBootstrap.vbs`).

    The sub also takes an → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/parameters[argument] to demonstrate how communication is possible between the driving WSF and the receiving VBA module.

{ Experimental creation of Excel documents

  2019-07-25: I started to experiment to use accessBootstrap.vbs to also create → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] files.
