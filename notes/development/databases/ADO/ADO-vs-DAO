→ development/databases/DAO/index[DAO] is older than → development/databases/ADO[ADO].

DAO was developped for → development/databases/Access/index. ADO's goal is to have a unique programming interface to a variety of databases (Oracle, MS-SQL ...).
So, when using → development/databases/Access/index, DAO seems to be the preferred technology.
