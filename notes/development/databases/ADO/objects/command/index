$ ADODB.Command
@ command

An `ADODB.Command` represents an action that is performed on the → development/databases/OLE-DB#ole-db-data-source[(OLE-DB?) datasource]. Typically, such a command is an
→ development/databases/SQL/statement.

An `command` object is usually used to parametrize an SQL statement.
-
This allows to execute the «same» SQL statement multiple times where on each execution its parameters are set to different values.
-
These parameters are defined using the `command` object's → development/databases/ADO/objects/parameters[`parameters`] collection which happens
to be the default member of the `command` object.

A statement that is not parametrized and executed only once, can alternatively
also be executed with the → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection/execute[`execute()`] method of the → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection[`ADODB.Connection`] object.

If the command object (that is: its action) returns → development/Data (for example for → development/databases/SQL/select[`select` statements]), the data is returned in a
→ development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[`recordSet` object].

The `command` is executed by invoking its → development/databases/ADO/objects/command/execute[`execute()`] method.

{ Methods and properties

  table { ll

   `activeConnection` ☰  A `→ development/databases/ADO/objects/connection` object.
   `cancel()` ☰ Terminates the execution of an asynchronous method call (i. e. a method invoked with the `adAsyncConnect`, `adAsyncExecute` or `adAsyncFetch` option).
   `commandStream` ☰ This property is mutually exclusive to using `commandText`
   `commandText` ☰ The SQL statement, table name, relative URL or stored procedure call.
   `commandTimeout` ☰ 
   `commandType` ☰ Setting `commandType` helps determine the command type of `commandText` (`adCmdText`, `adCmdTable` or `adCmdStoredProc`)
   → development/databases/ADO/objects/command/createParameter[`createParameter()`] ☰ Creates a `→ development/databases/ADO/objects/parameter` object with the specified properties.
   `dialect` ☰ A → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] that represents the dialect of the command text or stream. The default value for this property is `{C8B521FB-5CF3-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D}`, which indicates that the provider should choose how to interpret the command text or stream.
   → development/databases/ADO/objects/command/execute[`execute()`] ☰ Execute the statement that is associated with the command object.
   `name` ☰ 
   `namedParameters` ☰ `false` (default) or `true`. Determines if parameters are passed in order or by name.
   `parameters` ☰ A collection of `→ development/databases/ADO/objects/parameter` objects.
   `prepared` ☰ `false` or `true`
   `properties` ☰ A collection of `property` objects.
   `state` ☰
