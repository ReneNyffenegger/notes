$ ADODB.Command

An `ADODB.Command` represents an action that is performed on the → development/databases/OLE-DB#ole-db-data-source[(OLE-DB?) datasource]. Typically, such a command is an
→ development/databases/SQL/statement.

An `command` object is usually used to parametrize an SQL statement.
-
This allows to execute the «same» SQL statement multiple times where on each execution its parameters are set to different values.
-
These parameters are defined using the `command` object's → development/databases/ADO/objects/parameters[`parameters`] collection which happens
to be the default member of the `command` object.

A statement that is not parametrized and executed only once, can alternatively
also be executed with the → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection/execute[`execute()`] method of the → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection[`ADODB.Connection`] object.

If the command object (that is: its action) returns → development/Data (for example for → development/databases/SQL/select[`select` statements]), the data is returned in a
→ development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[`recordSet` object].

The `command` is executed by invoking its → development/databases/ADO/objects/command/execute[`execute()`] method.

 → development/databases/ADO[ADO]
