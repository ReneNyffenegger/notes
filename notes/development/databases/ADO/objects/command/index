$ ADODB.Command

An `ADODB.Command` represents an action that is performed on the → development/databases/OLE-DB#ole-db-data-source[(OLE-DB?) datasource]. Typically, such a command is an
→ development/databases/SQL/statement.

An ADODB.Command object is usually used if the same statement is to be executed multiple times with the same or different parameters. A statement that is executed only once, can alternatively
also be executed with the → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection/execute[`execute()`] method of the → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection[`ADODB.Connection`] object.

If this action returns → development/Data (for example for → development/databases/SQL/select[`select` statements]), the data is returned in a
→ development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[`RecordSet` object].

 → development/databases/ADO[ADO]
