$ ADODB.Command: execute

`command.execute` executes the *action* (typically an → development/databases/SQL/statement[SQL statement]) for which its
→ development/databases/ADO/objects/command[`command`] object was parametrized.

code {
cmd.execute(recordsAffected, parameters, options)
code }

All three parameters of `execute` are optional.

`execute()` returns a → development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[`recordSet` object].

? Apparently, by default, an execution is not performed within a → development/databases/SQL/transaction.

{ Basic sequence of steps to execute a command

  The following steps are required to execute a → development/databases/ADO/objects/command[`command`]. The language
  in which those are written is → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications]:
code {
→ development/languages/VBA/language/statements/dim[dim] conn  as → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection[adodb.connection]
 
conn.open "→ development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[provider]=...;...;..."
   
dim cmd as new → development/databases/ADO/objects/command[adodb.command]
    
→ development/languages/VBA/language/statements/set[set] cmd.activeConnection = conn
cmd.commandType          = adCmdText
cmd.commandText          = "update table set col_1 = :val_1, col_2 = :val_2 where col_3 = :val_3"

dim param as → development/databases/ADO/objects/parameter[adodb.parameter]

set param = cmd.createParameter(, adInteger, adParamInput    ): cmd.parameters.append param
set param = cmd.createParameter(, adDate   , adParamInput    ): cmd.parameters.append param
set param = cmd.createParameter(, adVarChar, adParamInput, 99): cmd.parameters.append param    
      
cmd.parameters(0) = 42
cmd.parameters(1) = no
cmd.parameters(2) ="hello world"

dim nofRowsUpdated as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/long

'   Finally.... the statement can be executed:
'
cmd.execute nofRowsUpdated

debug.print(nofRowsUpdated & " rows were updated")
code }


}
