$ ADODB: stream.loadFromFile

{ charCode #adodb-stream-loadFrom-file-charCode

  Unfortunatly, → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] doesn't seem to have any in-built capabilities to read (or write)
  → development/Unicode/UTF-8[UTF-8] encoded text (see → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/open/character-encoding[also here]).

  However, with the ADODB stream object, a utf-8 encoded file can be read as demonstrated in the following example:
