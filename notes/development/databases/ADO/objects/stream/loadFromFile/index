$ ADODB: stream.loadFromFile

{ charCode #adodb-stream-loadFrom-file-charCode

  Unfortunatly, → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] doesn't seem to have any in-built capabilities to read (or write)
  → development/Unicode/UTF-8[UTF-8] encoded text (see → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/open/character-encoding[also here]).

  However, with the ADODB stream object, a utf-8 encoded file can be read as demonstrated in the following example.

  The value of `adodb.stream.charSet` apparently can be set to any value found in the → Windows/registry[registry] under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/MIME/Database/Charset[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Charset`].

  In order for this example to compile, the → development/databases/ADO#adodb-add-reference[ActiveX Data Objects reference needs to be added].
