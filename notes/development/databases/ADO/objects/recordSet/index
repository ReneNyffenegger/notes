$ ADODB.RecordSet

An `ADODB.RecordSet` object represents a set of records.

Such a `recordSet` is for example returned by
  • → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection/execute[`connection.execute()`],
  • → development/databases/ADO/objects/command/execute[`command.execute()`], or
  • → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection/openSchema[`connection.OpenSchema()`].

{ Iterating over a recordSet

  The method `moveNext()` advances to the next record in a record set. The property `EOF` (end of file?) indicates if the end is reached.

  Thus, in → development/languages/VBA, it is possible to iterate over a record set like so:

code {
set rs = …
do while not rs.eof
   …
   rs.moveNext
loop 
code }

}
