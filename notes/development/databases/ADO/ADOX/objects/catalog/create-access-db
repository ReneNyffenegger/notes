$ Create an Access database on the command line with ADOOX and VBScript

The following simple script is a boilerplate that can be used and adapted to create → development/databases/Access[MS Access] databases on the command line
(→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] or → Windows/PowerShell) with → development/databases/ADO/ADOX and → development/languages/VBScript.

Note, for a reason that escapes me, I had to run this script from a → Windows/PowerShell#ps-32-64[32-bit PowerShell executable].
