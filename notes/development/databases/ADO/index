abbr: ActiveX Data Objects

ADO is one of the primary → Windows/development/MDAC technologies (the two others being → development/databases/OLE-DB and → development/databases/ODBC).

ADO is a wrapper around → development/databases/OLE-DB that privdes a *consistent* interface to the (various) → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB providers]. Thus,
ADO is used by client applications to access and manipulate → development/Data from various sources through OLE-DB.

{ Adding reference to VBA project #adodb-add-reference

  A reference to the ADO library (Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 6.1 Library) in an Excel → development/languages/VBA[VBA] project can be made in the
  → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window[immediate window]:
code {
call thisWorkbook.VBProject.references.addFromGuid("{B691E011-1797-432E-907A-4D8C69339129}", 6, 1)
code }

}
{ Remote Data Service (RDS)

  RDS is a feature of ADO that copies data to a client for manipulation and then updates the data on the server when done with it.

  RDS is deprecated in favour of *WCF Data Service* and will be removed from future → Windows/versions[Windows versions].

}
{ ADO Multidimensional (ADO MD)

  ADO MD is used for working with *multidimensional data*.

}
{ ADO 6.0

  ADO 6.0 is included in Windows Vista as part of the → Windows/development/MDAC[Windows Data Access Components (Windows DAC)] 6.0.

  ADO 6.0 is functionally equivalent to ADO 2.8.
