abbr: ActiveX Data Objects

ADO is one of the primary → Windows/development/MDAC technologies (the two others being → development/databases/OLE-DB and → development/databases/ODBC). In fact, in order to
use ADO, MDAC needs to be installed.

ADO is a wrapper around → development/databases/OLE-DB that privdes a *consistent* interface to the (various) → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB providers]. Thus,
ADO is used by client applications to access and manipulate → development/Data from various sources through OLE-DB.
-
Although conceptually, ADO is not tied to OLE-DB, the only engine that supports the ADO model *is* OLE-DB.

{ Adding reference to VBA project #adodb-add-reference

  A reference to the ADO library (Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 6.1 Library) in an Excel → development/languages/VBA[VBA] project can be made in the
  → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window[immediate window]:
code {
call thisWorkbook.VBProject.references.addFromGuid("{B691E011-1797-432E-907A-4D8C69339129}", 6, 1)
code }

{ ADO Object Model

  The ADO Object Model consists of eight objects (as of ADO 2.5):
  table { ll
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection[Connection] ☰ Represents a connection to an → development/databases/OLE-DB#ole-db-data-source[OLE-DB datasource]
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/error[Error] ☰ Details about errors encountered
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/command[Command] ☰ An action (typicallly: an → development/databases/SQL/statement) to be executed on the data source
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/parameter[Parameter] ☰ 
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/parameters[Parameters] ☰ An optional set of parameters for the → development/databases/ADO/objects/command[Command] object
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[Recordset] ☰ A set of records
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/field[Field] ☰ A column in a → development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[Recordset] (in a Record?)
    Property ☰
    → development/databases/ADO/objects/stream[Stream] ☰ Read/write binary → development/Data
    Record ☰ A row in a → development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[Recordset], directory or file
  table }

  ADO/R (which is used with the *Advanced Data Connector*) is a subset that consists of the *Recordset* and *Field* objects only.

}
{ Remote Data Service (RDS)

  RDS is a feature of ADO that copies data to a client for manipulation and then updates the data on the server when done with it.

  RDS is deprecated in favor of *WCF Data Service* and will be removed from future → Windows/versions[Windows versions].

}
{ ADO Multidimensional (ADO MD)

  ADO MD is used for working with *multidimensional data*.

}
{ ADO 6.0

  ADO 6.0 is included in Windows Vista as part of the → Windows/development/MDAC[Windows Data Access Components (Windows DAC)] 6.0.

  ADO 6.0 is functionally equivalent to ADO 2.8.
