$ ADODB examples for PowerShell / MS-Access

This are a few examples that attempt to demonstrate how → Windows/PowerShell can be used together with → development/databases/ADO[ADO DB] to create an 
→ development/databases/ADO/ADODB-examples/PowerShell/MS-Access[MS Access database], insert some data into a table and select it agein.

When I tried these example on a 64-bit Windows machine, I had to make sure that I ran a → Windows/PowerShell#ps-32-64[32-bit PowerShell executable]. With the 64-bit executable,
I received a *Class not registered* error message.

{ Creating an accdb file #ps-create-accdb

  The following example uses → development/databases/ADO/ADOX to create an → development/databases/Access[MS Access] database file (→ development/filename-extensions#accdb[`.accdb`]).

  Create an MS-Access database → development/databases/ADO/ADOX/objects/catalog/create-access-db[with ADOX and VBScript].
