$ SQLite: pragmas
@ pragmas

SQLite allows to modifiy its mode of operation by setting *pragmas*.

{ cache_size

This pragma controls the memory usage of → development/databases/SQLite.

`pragma cache_size = 1000000` allocates 1 MB for the DB cache.

}
{ synchronous

`pragma synchronous = OFF` prevents → development/databases/SQLite from doing `fsync`'s when writing.

This helps improve the → development/databases/SQLite/Performance[performance], however, the database is not transactionally safe anymore.

}
