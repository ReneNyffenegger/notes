$ SQLite: pragmas
@ pragmas

SQLite allows to modifiy its mode of operation by setting *pragmas*.

{ cache_size

This pragma controls the memory usage of → development/databases/SQLite.

`pragma cache_size = 1000000` allocates 1 MB for the DB cache.

}
{ compile_options #pragma-compile-options

  `pragma compile_options` shows the values of the compile options used when → development/databases/SQLite[SQLite] was compiled.

}
{ foreign_keys

  `pragma foreign_keys` enforces → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys].

  Apparently, within a → development/databases/SQLite/transactions[transaction], `pragma foreign_keys` remains without effect:
  gh|about-sqlite|/pragma/foreign_keys.sql||

}
{ synchronous

`pragma synchronous = OFF` prevents → development/databases/SQLite from doing `fsync`'s when writing.

This helps improve the → development/databases/SQLite/Performance[performance], however, the database is not transactionally safe anymore.

}
