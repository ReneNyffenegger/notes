$ SQLite shell: .output

`.output /path/to/out/file` redirects output to the named file rather than displaying it in the console. `.output` without filename ends the redirection, and the output is shown in the console again.

code {
sqlite> .output /tmp/schema.sql
sqlite> → development/databases/SQLite/shell/schema
sqlite> .output
code }

sa:
  → development/databases/SQLite/shell
