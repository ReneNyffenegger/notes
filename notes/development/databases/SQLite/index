{ An SQLite database is one file

  A really cool feature of SQLite is that a database is really just *one ordinary file*.

  This file can be copied from one computer to another, even from → Windows to → Linux and vice versa.

  At times, there is no need to even have a file. In such cases, a transient SQLite database can be created completely in memory.

  See also: → development/databases/SQLite/internals/database-file.

{ SQLite runs without server

  SQLite does not require a server installation.

{ Turning off autocommit

  SQLLite commits every statement by default (so called *auto commit*).

  To turn this behaviour off (which increases performance greatly when lots of statements are executed in sequence), the statements must be enclosed in `begin transaction` .. `commit transaction`:
code {
begin transaction;

insert into tab_something values ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
insert into tab_something values ('one', 'two',  null);
…
…

commit transaction;
code }

}
{ pragma

code {
pragma quick_check;
code }

}
{ PHP

  It seems sqlite can be accessed (in Ubuntu) from → development/web/php with
code {
sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3
code }

}

  Apparently, → Windows/versions/10 also uses SQLite, see → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll[`winsqlite3.dll`] under → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32[`%SystemRoot%\System32`].

  This DLL can be used to → development/databases/SQLite/VBA[connect to SQLite from Visual Basic for Applications].
