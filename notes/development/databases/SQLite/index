{ Turning off autocommit

  SQLLite commits every statement by default (so called *auto commit*).

  To turn this behaviour off (which increases performance greatly when lots of statements are executed in sequence), the statements must be enclosed in `begin transaction` .. `commit transaction`:
code {
begin transaction;

insert into tab_something values ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
insert into tab_something values ('one', 'two',  null);
…
…

commit transaction;
code }

}
{ pragma

code {
pragma quick_check;
code }

}

  It seems sqlite can be accessed (in Ubuntu) from → development/web/php with
code {
sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3
code }

}
