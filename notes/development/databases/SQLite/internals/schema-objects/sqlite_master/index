$ SQLite: sqlite_master (internal schema object)

`sqlite_master` is an → development/databases/SQLite/internals/schema-objects[internal table] that is present in all
→ development/databases/SQLite[SQLite databases]. The content of this table describes the database's *schema*.

The structure of `sqlite_master` can be displayed with the → development/databases/SQLite/shell[SQLite shell] command
→ development/databases/SQLite/shell/schema#sqlite-schema-table-name[`.schema sqlite_master`]:
code {
sqlite> .schema sqlite_master
CREATE TABLE sqlite_master (
  type text,
  name text,
  tbl_name text,
  rootpage integer,
  sql text
);
code }

{ Using sqlite_master

  The following simple SQL script tries to demonstrate how `sqlite_master` might be used to query
  for information about schema objects:
  gh|about-sqlite|/internal-schema-objects/sqlite_master/example.sql||

}
{ analyze sqlite_master

  When an application changes the statistics tables directly, → development/databases/SQLite will not immediately notice the changes.

  An application can then force the *query planner* to re-read the statistics table by running
code {
analyze sqlite_master;
code }

}

sa:

  The → development/databases/SQLite/shell[SQLite shell] command → development/databases/SQLite/shell/schema[`.schema`] that can be used to display the
  → development/databases/SQLite/tables/create[`create table`] statements that were used to create a table.
