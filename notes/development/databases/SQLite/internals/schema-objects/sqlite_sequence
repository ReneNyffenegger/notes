$ SQLite: sqlite_sequence (internal schema object)

The → development/databases/SQLite/internals/schema-objects[SQLite internal] table `sqlite_sequence` is used to store information about
*→ development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/primary-key/autoincrement columns*. In fact, it is created when the first table with an `autoincrement` column is created.

{ Structure of sqlite_sequence

  The structure of `sqlite_sequence` can be displayed with the → development/databases/SQLite/shell[SQLite shell] command
  → development/databases/SQLite/shell/schema#sqlite-schema-table-name[`.schema sqlite_sequence`]. Because `sqlite_sequence` is only created
  when the first table with an *autoincrement* column exists, we first need to → development/databases/SQLite/tables/create[create such a table].

code {
create table dummy (id integer primary key autoincrement);
.schema sqlite_sequence
--
-- CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq);
code }

  As can be seen, `sqlite_sequence` has the two columns
    • `name` and
    • `seq`
