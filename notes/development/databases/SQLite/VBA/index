$ Connect to SQLite from VBA using winsqlite3.dll

→ Windows/versions/10 comes with a pre installed → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL that can be used for accessing
→ development/databases/SQLite databases (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll[`C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll`]).

Because → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] (VBA) allows to use functions that are defined in a DLL, it is possible to
use SQLite in VBA directly, that is, without → development/databases/OLE-DB or → development/databases/ADO[ADOX] or any other of these fancy technologies.

It was only after I started to develop these sources that I found out that → https://github.com/govert[Govert van Drimmelen] already did → https://github.com/govert/SQLiteForExcel[the same thing, but way more complete].

The following two code snippets try to demonstrate how that might be achieved.

{ winsqlite3_4_VBA.bas

  These → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/declare[`declare` statements] allow to use
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll from
  → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications]

  The `sqlite_bind_*` → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[functions] should accept a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant and then determine
  the variant's underlying → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[data type] and based upon this type call `sqlite_bind_DATATYPE_()` in `winsqlite3.dll`.

  The headerfile → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/Include/version/um/winsqlite/winsqlite3_h[`winsqlite3_h.h`] shows the parameters and data types used for accessing
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll[`C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll`].
