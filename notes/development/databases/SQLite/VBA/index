$ Connect to SQLite from VBA using winsqlite3.dll

→ Windows/versions/10 comes with a pre installed → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL that can be used for accessing
→ development/databases/SQLite databases (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll[`C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll`]).

Because → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] (VBA) allows to use functions that are defined in a DLL, it is possible to
use SQLite in VBA directly, that is, without → development/databases/OLE-DB or → development/databases/ADO[ADOX] or any other of these fancy technologies.

The following two code snippets try to demonstrate how that might be achieved.

{ winsqlite3_4_VBA.bas

  These → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/declare[`declare` statements] allow to use
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll from
  → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications]
