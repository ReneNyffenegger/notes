$ SQLite: pragma journal_mode
@ journal_mode

The value of the → development/databases/SQLite/pragmas[pragma] `journal_mode` can be set to one of
table { ll
  `delete` ☰ The default journaling mode. In this mode, the rollback journal is deleted when a transaction commits.
  `truncate` ☰ The journal mode is truncated rather than deleted when a transaction commits (this is possibly faster as no modification of the directory entry is required).
  `persist` ☰
  `memory` ☰ The journal is managed in memory. This is possibly faster at the risk of the database become corrupt.
  `wal` ☰ Use a *write-ahead* log instead of a rollback journal. Ben Johnson thinks that → https://youtu.be/TmZrZFIumhM?t=600[WAL mode is generally the best mode to run SQLite in]. Once set, this mode is persisted in the database.
  `off` ☰ 
table }

Just executing `pragma journal_mode` reports the current journaling mode associated with the current connection.
