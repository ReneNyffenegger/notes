$ SQLite: pragma foreign_keys

`pragma foreign_keys = on` enforces → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys]. This is usually necessary because
by default, → development/databases/SQLite does not enforce foreign keys.

Apparently, within a → development/databases/SQLite/transactions[transaction], `pragma foreign_keys` remains without effect:
gh|about-sqlite|/sql/pragma/foreign_keys.sql||

Explicitly turning off the validation of foreign keys might be useful when
→ development/databases/SQLite/shell/dump/export-import[importing a `.dump`'ed database].

sa:
  The `foreign_key_check` pragma.
