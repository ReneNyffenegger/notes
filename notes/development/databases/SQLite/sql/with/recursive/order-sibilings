$ SQLite: recursive query - order siblings

The following sql snippets try to demonstrate how SQLite allows to hierarchically select a result set where siblings (records with the same parent record) are
ordered by a specific criteria.

This is the table that we're going to select from.
-
`id` is the → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary key].
-
`parent` is a record's → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign key] to its parent.
-
`pos` is the ordering of records with the same parent.
-
Since we want the ordering of the siblings to be determinated, we place a ->­development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/unique[unique constraint] for `parent` and `pos`.

Some records for the table:

The hierarchical query.
-
The «trick» to achieve the desired ordering of the siblings is to order the level descending and the position ascending:
