$ SQLite: analyze

`analyze` gathers statistics about the available indices.

After analyzing a databse, SQLite uses the gathered statistics to → development/databases/SQLite/sql/select/join#join-reorder-tables[reorder tables] in a
→ development/databases/SQLite/sql/select[select statement].

The statistics are stored in the tables `sqlite_stat1`, `sqlite_stat3` and/or `sqlite_stat4`, depending on the compile time options(?) of SQLite.
