$ SQLite: upsert clause

→ development/databases/SQLite does not have a `merge` keyword, instead, it comes with an `upsert` clause which is an addition to the → development/databases/SQLite/sql/insert[`insert` statement].

The table that the `upsert` clause is used on requires at least a → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary key] or
→ development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/unique[unique] → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints[constraint].

{ on conflict do nothing

  The following example tries to insert the same primary key twice. Because of the `on conflict do nothing` clause, the second insertion of `id=3` causes no error message and
  does not alter the table's data:

  gh|about-sqlite|/sql/insert/upsert/do-nothing.sql||

}
{ on conflict do update

  With `on conflict(pk_name) do update`, it's possible to override some values in the destination table if a primary key already exists:
  gh|about-sqlite|/sql/insert/upsert/do-update.sql||

}
