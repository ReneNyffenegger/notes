$ SQLite: like

{ Case in-sensitiveness

  By default, a query involving a `like` does not take into effect the case of the strings compared.
  This cannot even be changed with the → development/databases/SQLite/sql/expressions/collate[collate expression].

  In order to force case senstiveness in queries with a `like` expression, the → development/databases/SQLite/pragmas[pragma] `case_sensitive_like` must be turned on:

  gh|about-sqlite|/sql/expressions/like/case-sensitiveness.sql||

}
