$ SQLite: explain query plan

`explain query plan select ...` returns a result set with for columns, named `selectid`, `order`, `from` and `detail` (see → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-sqlite/blob/master/sql/explain/explain_query_plan-columns.sql[here]):
code {
selectid  order  from  detail
--------  -----  ----  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0         0      1     SCAN TABLE tq84_eqp_A2B AS A2B
0         1      0     SEARCH TABLE tq84_eqp_A AS A USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
0         2      2     SEARCH TABLE tq84_eqp_B AS B USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)
code }

For accessed tables, `detail` value starts either with `SCAN` or `SEARCH`. `SCAN` means:*full table scan*, `SEARCH` means that only a selected subset of the records are selected by means of an index.
