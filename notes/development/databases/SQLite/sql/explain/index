$ SQLite: explaining an SQL statement

With `explain` and → development/databases/SQLite/sql/explain/query-plan[`explain query plan`], an → development/databases/SQLite/sql[SQL statement] can be explained.
These clauses need to be prepended to the statement to be explained.
code {
explain select ...;
explain query plan select ...;
code }

With `explain`, SQLite returns a list of *virtual machine instructions*. With `explain query plan`, a less detailed plan is returned.
