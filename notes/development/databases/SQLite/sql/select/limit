$ SQLite: limit clause in select statements
@ limit

With the `limit` clause, → development/databases/SQLite can be instructed to return only the first n records or the records n through m (paging).

{ Test data

  In order to demonstrate this, some test data is necessary.

  The table is filled with the numbers 0 through 9 and the respective english representation.
  
  The table is not filled in any particualar order on purpose.

}
{ Selecting the first 4 records

  In the following → development/databases/SQLite/sql/select[select statement], the limit clause is used to limit the result set to 4 records only:

  gh|about-sqlite|/sql/select/limit/first-4-records.sql||

}
{ Select the next 2 records (paging)

  If the `limit` clause is given two arguments, the first is interpreted as the start record and the second argument as the number of records that should be returned:

  SQLite also understands the `limit … offset` clause which is easier to read. The next query returns the same records:
