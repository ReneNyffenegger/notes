$ SQLite: joins

As of version 3.37, SQLite uses *nested loops* to *join* tables in SQL statements.

{ Reordering tables #join-reorder-tables

  For ~inner joins~, SQLite might choose to change the order of tables from that found in the `from` clause.

  This is not the case for ~outer joins~ because order of the tables is important.

  For ~cross joins~, the order of the join does not affect the result. Still, SQLite does not change the ordering of the tables in cross joins.
  -
  This fact might be used to force the ordering for tables when confronted with performance problems.
