$ SQLite: update statements
@ update statements

{ Update a table with aggregated values from another table

}
{ Implicit table name in FROM clause

  Apparently, > development/databases/SQLite follows the → development/databases/PostgreSQL SQL dialect (→ https://sqlite.org/st2020/slide17.html[see here]), so that in the
  following example, the table name of the table being updated does not have to be mentioned explicitely in the `FROM` clause:

}
