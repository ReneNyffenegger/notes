$ SQLite: foreign key constraint

SQLite supports foreign key constraints since `3.6.19` (Oct 14, 2009) - but they're not enforced by default (but SQLite could
handle a `create table` statement with foreign keys even before that).

Even after `3.6.19`, SQLite must be compiled without `SQLITE_OMIT_FOREIGN_KEY` and without `SQLITE_OMIT_TRIGGER`.
-
The compile options used to compile can be queried with → development/databases/SQLite/pragmas#pragma-compile-options[pragma compile_options].
-

In order to enforce a foreign key constraint, the following → development/databases/SQLite/pragmas[pragma] must be used:
code {
pragma foreign_keys = on;
code }
If this command returns nothing (rather than either a 0 or 1), foreign keys are not suppurted with the current SQLIte executable.
