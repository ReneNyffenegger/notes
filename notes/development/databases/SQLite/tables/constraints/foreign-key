$ SQLite: foreign key constraint

SQLite supports foreign key constraints since `3.6.19` (Oct 14, 2009) - but they're not enforced by default (but SQLite could
handle a `create table` statement with foreign keys even before that).
-
In order to enforce a foreign key constraint, the following → development/databases/SQLite/pragmas[pragma] must be used:
code {
pragma foreign_keys = on;
code }

sa:
  → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints
