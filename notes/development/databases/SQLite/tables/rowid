$ SQLite: rowid
@ rowid

Every SQLite → development/databases/SQLite/tables[table] (except → development/databases/SQLite/tables#without-rowid[without rowid] tables) has a `rowid` column.

A rowid value is a 64 bit integer.

The rowid value can be queried with the `rowid` key word. Synonyms for `rowid` are: `oid` and `_rowid`.

If a table has a column that is defined to be an `integer development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary key]`, this column stores the rowid, that is, the respective column names is an alias for `rowid` (or vice versa).


{ Demonstration

  The following script tries to demonstrate rowids:
  gh|about-sqlite|/tables/rowid/intro.sql||

}
{ Selecting the last inserted rowid #last_insert_rowid

  The rowid of the last inserted row can be selected with the `last_insert_rowid()` function:
  gh|about-sqlite|/tables/rowid/last_insert_rowid.sql||

  See also → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/primary-key#autoincrement-pk[autoincrementing the primary key]. 

  In → development/languages/Python, the last rowid can be selected with → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sqlite3#py-sqlite3-lastrowid[cursor_lastrowid].
