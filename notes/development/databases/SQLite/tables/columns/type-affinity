$ SQLite: type affinity of columns

In → development/databases/SQLite, table can be created → development/databases/SQLite/tables/create#sqlite-create-table-datatype[without specifying a data type for their columns]. And even, if tables
are created with a → development/databases/SQLite/datatypes[data type], it is still possible to store values of different data types in the same → development/databases/SQLite/tables/columns.

The data type in which a value of a given data type is stored in a table is determined by a column's *type affinity*.
There are five different type affinities.
  • text
  • numeric
  • integer
  • real
  • blob

Interestingly, there are also five data types, but there is no → development/databases/SQLite/datatypes/null[null] type affinity, conversely, there is no *numeric* data type.

The following example → development/databases/SQLite/tables/create[creates a table] with the different type affinities and insertes values of different types into the table.
It then selects those values again and uses → development/databases/SQLite/functions/typeof[`typeof()`] to reveal the actual data type that was inserted.
