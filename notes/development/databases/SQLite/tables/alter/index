$ SQLite: alter table
@ alter table

The `alter table` statement can be used to
  • rename a → development/databases/SQLite/tables[table]
  • rename columns in a table
  • add columns to a table

It is especially noteworthy that `alter table` cannot be used to add → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints[constraints], such as
→ development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/primary-key[primary] or → development/databases/SQLite/tables/constraints/foreign-key[foreign keys], that is, there is no
`alter table … add constraint` clause.
-
The reason for this shortcoming is that the definition of the database's schema is stored as sql statement text in the
→ development/databases/SQLite/internals/schema-objects[internal] table → development/databases/SQLite/internals/schema-objects/sqlite_master[`sqlite_master`] and it is somewhat difficult
to modify the stored statements' text in that table.
