$ Databases on-premise vs. databases in the cloud

{ Shift of focus of attention

  Some tasks require less attention on databases in the cloud than on-premise databases:
    • Scaling
    • → development/databases/DBA/backup-recovery[Backup/restore] management
    • Distaster recovery planning

    • → development/Data/migration
    • Cost opimazation
    • Performance tuning
    • Defining organization goals
