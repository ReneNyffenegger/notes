ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

A transaction is a sequence of »unit of works« whose sum represents an »indivisible logical unit of work«.
Transactions are fundamental to (distributed) applications.

Atomicity: all »units of work« or none.
-
Consistency: a transaction brings the system from one consistent (non contractional) state to another.
-
Isolation: Effects of »unit of work« are not visible outside the transaction until transaction is completed successfully (see also → development/databases/SQL/transaction/isolation-level[isolation level)
-
Durability: After completion, the transaction will survive system failures.
