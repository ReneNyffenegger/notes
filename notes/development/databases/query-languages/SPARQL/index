  Trying to use the Semantic Web without SPARQL is like trying to use a relational → development/databases[database] without → development/databases/SQL[SQL].
" [ Tim Berners-Lee ]

SPARQL (like → development/databases/SQL[SQL]) is a *declarative query language*. The language allows
to perform *data manipulation* and *data definition* operations on data that
is represented as a collection of → development/web/RDF[RDF] language sentences/statements.

SPARQL stands for *SPARQL Protocol and → development/web/RDF[RDF] Query Language*.

Apparently, SPARQL is used in → https://query.wikidata.org/[wikidata] (where queries can be formulated and executed).

A database is a set of *subject-predicate-object* triples.

*Variables* start with a question mark (`?`) or dollar symbol (`$`).

Comments are introduced with the *hash symbol* (`#`).

{ JSON Result Format

code {
{
  "head":    { "vars": ["col_A", "col_B"] },
  "results": { "bindings": [
    { "col_A": { "type": "typed-literal", "value": "1910" } , "col_B": { "type": "typed-literal", "value": "2" }},
    { "col_A": { "type": "typed-literal", "value": "1950" } , "col_B": { "type": "typed-literal", "value": "2" }},
  }
}
code }

  Other keys that I've seen in the `head` object:
    • `link`

  Other keys that I've seen in the objects of the `bindings` array:
    • `datatype` (for example with the value `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer`)
  

code {
{ 
  "head"   : {},
  "boolean": true
}
code }

  The → development/web/Multipurpose-Internet-Mail-Extensions[Internet Media Type / MIME] for SPARQL Query Results in JSON format is `application/sparql-results+json`.
