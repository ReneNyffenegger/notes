  Trying to use the Semantic Web without SPARQL is like trying to use a relational → development/databases[database] without → development/databases/SQL[SQL].
" [ Tim Berners-Lee ]

SPARQL (like → development/databases/SQL[SQL]) is a *declarative query language*. The language allows
to perform *data manipulation* and *data definition* operations on data that
is represented as a collection of → development/web/RDF[RDF] language sentences/statements.

SPARQL stands for *SPARQL Protocol and → development/web/RDF[RDF] Query Language*.

Apparently, SPARQL is used in → https://query.wikidata.org/[wikidata] (where queries can be formulated and executed).

A database is a set of *subject-predicate-object* triples.

*Variables* start with a question mark (`?`) or dollar symbol (`$`).
