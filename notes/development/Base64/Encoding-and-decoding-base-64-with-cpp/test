$ Test for the Base64 C++ library

This is a simple test case to test → development/Base64/Encoding-and-decoding-base-64-with-cpp[my C++ Base64 library]. The program encodes and decodes a few strings and then checks if both versions are equal.
Additionally, it also checks the string's decoded version with their expected value.

The program exits with 1 if one of the tests is not successful and with 0 otherwise.

Only errors are reported. So, ideally, the tool runs without printing anything. See also → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-base64/issues/32[issue 32].
