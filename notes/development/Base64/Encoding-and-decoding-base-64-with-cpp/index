$ Encoding and decoding base 64 with c++

This is a simple library to → development/Base64 encode and decode → development/Data with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C++].

{ Interface version 2.0

  This is the proposed interface for the version 2.0 of this library (as of 2020-04-29).

  { base64_encode

   `base64_encode()` comes in two overloaded versions:
code {
std::string base64_encode(std::string const& s, bool url = false);
std::string base64_encode(unsigned char const*, unsigned int len, bool url = false);
code }
  
    Both of these functions encode data as Base 64 and return the encoded string as a `std::string`.
      
    The parameter `url` determines if the encoded string can be used in → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URLs]: if `url` is set to `true`, the encoded string will contain `-`, `_` and `+` instead of
   `+`, `/` and `=`. (See → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Implementations_and_history[Wikipedia] for more information).

    The parameter `len` is needed for the second version because the length of an `unsigned char const*` is not determined if the data contains null values.

  }
  { base64_encode_pem / base64_encode_mime

code {
std::string base64_encode_pem (std::string const& s);
std::string base64_encode_mime(std::string const& s);
code }

    These two functions also encode data as Base 64. Additionally, they insert a line break after each 64th (pem) and 76th (mime) encoded characters.

  }
  { base64_decode

   `base64_decode()` decodes an encoded string.

code {
std::string base64_decode(std::string const& s, bool remove_linebreaks = false);
code }

    The parameter `remove_linebreaks` needs to be set to `true` if the encoded string is expected to contain → development/line-break[line breaks], for example because they were encoded with
   `base64_encode_pem()` or `base64_encode_mime()`.

  table }

 `base64.cpp` contains two simple C++ functions to encode and decode string from/to → development/Base64: `base64_encode` and `base64_decode`.

  → development/Base64/Encoding-and-decoding-base-64-with-cpp/test[`test.cpp`] can be used to test the functionality.

{ Contributions

  I am thankful for the following contributions to this libary.

  → https://github.com/minastaros[minastaros] for improving the code and adding test cases. (Version `1.01.00`)

  → https://github.com/sea-kg[Evgenii Sopov] provided → development/Base64/wsjcpp_yml[`wsjcpp.yml`].

  → https://github.com/khiemdoan[Khiem Doan] added the correct → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/header-files[headerfile]: `<cctype>` rather than `<iostream>`, which is sufficient for `isalnum()`.
  -
  2020-04-29: it turns out, this header file is not needed anymore.

  → https://github.com/ipodipad[ipodipad] changed the code so that it eliminates the annoying → https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23604699[CppCheck static analysis warning cppcheck:variableScope].

  → https://github.com/wbflooksky[wbfloofsky] provided a pull request that encouraged me to write directly into pre-allocated `std::string` buffers rather than first write into a separate buffer and then copy this buffer (`push_back()`)
  to the string. This change led to Version 1.03.
  -
  *wbfloofsky* also added the functionality to measure the time it takes to encode and decode a string in `test.cpp`.
  This inspired me to add → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-base64/blob/master/measure-time.cpp[`measure-time.cpp`] which does that, and only that.

  Francisco Ruiz added → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-base64/blob/master/test-google.cpp[`test-google.cpp`], which is more or less the same as `test.cpp`, but apparently can be used in a
  Google testing framework.

  Francisco Ruiz and → https://github.com/huangxinV587[huangxinV587] both suggested that I use a lookup function to find the position of an encodeded character in `base64_chars` in order to
  improveperformance. I have merged their code into one version and given the lookup function the name `pos_of_char()`.

  → https://github.com/JomaCorpFX[JomaCorpFX] provided the main functionality for `base64_encode_pem()`, `base64_encode_mime()` and the `url` parameter in `base64_encode()`.

  → https://github.com/kosniaz[kosniaz] spotted a bug with url-encoded data. This bug is now fixed (2020-05-09) and resulted in release candidate *2.rc.01*.
