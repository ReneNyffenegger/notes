$ OpenStreetMaps: nodes, tags and relations

Nodes, tags and relations are the fundamental data structures in OpenStreetMap.

A ~node~ is a coordinate, consisting of a *lattitude* and a *longitude*.

A ~way~ is an ordered list (array) of nodes.

A ~relation~ is an ordered list of nodes, ways and even other relations. Each member in this set is assigned a *role*. 

Then, there are also ~tags~ which are key value pairs to describe what nodes, ways and relations actually are in the real world.
