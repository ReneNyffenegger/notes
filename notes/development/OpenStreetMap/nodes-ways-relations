$ OpenStreetMaps: nodes, ways, relations and tags

Nodes, tags and relations are the fundamental data structures in OpenStreetMap.

A ~node~ is a coordinate, consisting of a *lattitude* and a *longitude*.

A ~way~ is an ordered list (array) of nodes.

A ~relation~ is an ordered list of nodes, ways and even other relations. Each member in this set is assigned a *role*. 

Then, there are also ~tags~ which are key value pairs to describe what nodes, ways and relations actually are in the real world.

sa:

  The data of a way (or node or relation) can be queried with the → development/OpenStreetMap/API, for example like so:
code {
→ tools/cURL[curl] -s -X GET https://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/way/1154969870
code }

  → development/OpenStreetMap[OpenStreetMap]

  The → development/OpenStreetMap#osm-overpass-api[Overpass API] provides → https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Areas[areas] as an extension to the three basic OSM data types nodes, tags and relations.
