$ OpenStreetMaps: nodes, ways, relations and tags

Nodes, ways, relations and → development/OpenStreetMap/tags[tags] are the fundamental data structures in → development/OpenStreetMap[OpenStreetMap]:
  • A ~node~ is a coordinate, consisting of a *lattitude* and a *longitude*.
  • A ~way~ is an ordered list (array) of nodes.
  • A ~relation~ is an ordered list of nodes, ways and even other relations. Each member in this set is assigned a *role*. 

Each of these objects has a few properties
  • Unique (per object, that is!) 64-bit signed integer *id*. Negative ids are usually used when → https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#Diff_upload:_POST_/api/0.6/changeset/#id/upload[uploading new data] to indicate that the objects refer to new objects and the OSM server is expected to assign an id.
  • A (possibly empty) set of *tags* (which are textual, → development/Unicode/UTF-8, key-value pairs). The key is unique for an object.
  • Version number (which is *1* when the object is created)
  • A (boolean) *visibility flag*. Only the most recent version of an object can have this flag set to true. When the object is deleted, a new version is created where the visibility flag is set to false.
  • Timestamp
  • Changeset id
  • User id

Then, there are also → development/OpenStreetMap/tags[tags] which are textual key value pairs to describe what nodes, ways and relations actually are in the real world.

{ Tags

  { Colons

    A colon typically specifies a hierarchical nature (`name`, `name:en`, `name:de`…)

  }
  { Real-world and other attributes

    Most tags describe real-world features.

    Other tags, such as `source` or `created_by` are not related to the physical thing being mapped.

    And then there are also some tags such as `note`, `description`, `fixme`, `start_date`, `survey:date` etc.

  }
  { Implication of tags on ways

    Some tags, when applied on ways, imply a multipolygon (for example: `landuse`) while others imply lines (such as `highway`).
    -
    There are even cases, where a tag can imply both (`man_made=pier`).

  }

}
{ Changesets

  A changeset records → development/Data/metadata 

}
{ Relation #osm-rel

  { type attribute

    A relation's *type* can be specified with the → development/OpenStreetMap/tags#type[`type`] tag. Allegedly, 99% of all relations have this attribue set.

    The most often seen attributes are:
    table { ll
      `multipolygon` ☰ Relations whose type is `multipolygon` should only have way, but no node members. The roles of the members should be `inner` or `outer`
      `restriction` ☰ Essential members are those with a `via` tag.
      `route` ☰ Public transport routes, hiking and biking routes etc.
      `boundary` ☰ Boundaries can often be understood as multipolygons. A node member (`admin_centre`) lables the boundary.
      `associated street` ☰ Points to a node with tags to make sense.
      `public_transport` ☰
      `site` ☰
      `destination_sign` ☰ Structurally similar to `restriction`.
    table }

  }

}

{ Using APIs to query data related to nodes, ways or relations

  { OSM API

    The data of a way (or node or relation) can be queried with the → development/OpenStreetMap/API, for example like so:
code {
→ tools/cURL[curl] -s -X GET https://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/way/1154969870
code }

  }
  { Overpass API

    The data related to a given node can be queried using the → development/OpenStreetMap#osm-overpass-api[Overpass API] with the following query:
code {
node(26863664);
→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/out;
code }

    In addition, the → development/OpenStreetMap#osm-overpass-api[Overpass API] provides → https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Areas[areas] as an extension to the three basic OSM data types nodes, tags and relations.

  }
}
{ Historical notes

  The current OSM data model (nodes, ways, and relations) has evolved from an earlier model
  with
    • nodes,
    • segments (which connected exactly two nodes)

  In 2005, segments were removed an relations were added.
  -
  Apparently, there was some support for an *area* datatype before this change. But with the removal of segments, the area datatype is gone, too.
  
  Changesets were introduced in 2007.

}
{ Limits #osm-db-limits

  There are some limits, for example:
    • A way can contain a maximum of 2000 nodes
    • A relation can contain a maximum of 32000 members

  Such limits can be queried using the OSM API request `GET /api/0.6/capabilities`:
code {
$ URL=https://api.openstreetmap.org
$ VERSION=0.6
$ API=$URL/api/$VERSION
$ → tools/cURL[curl] $API/capabilities

}
