{ PBF Parser

  The parser consists of python script files:
    → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/OpenStreetMap/blob/master/scripts/pbf-parser/fileformat_pb2.py[fileformat_pb2.py],
    → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/OpenStreetMap/blob/master/scripts/pbf-parser/osmformat_bp2.py[osmformat_pb2.py] and
    → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/OpenStreetMap/blob/master/scripts/pbf-parser/OSMpbfParser.py[OSMpbfParser.py].

  The first two files are generated files while the third depends on them.

  In order to use these scripts, → https://github.com/google/protobuf[Google's protocol buffers] is needed. On ~Windows~, this is `protoc.exe` which can be downloaded somewhere from
  → https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases[here]. Make sure that the → development/environment-variable#path[`%PATH%`] environment variable points to the directory into which `protoc.exe` is extracted.

  On ~Ubuntu~, protocol buffers can be installed with `sudo apt-get install python-protobuf`.

  Alternatively, protocol buffers might be built directlly from the sources:
code {
python setup.py build
python setup.py test
python setup.py install
code }
 
}
