$ Overpass API: settings

Overpass *settings* set optional global variables.

These settings need to be set as first → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements[statement] of an Overpass API query.

Settings declarations are enclosed in brackets []. A colon (`:`) separates the setting name from its value.

The settings section is terminated with a semicolon (`;`). → #overpass-multiple-settings[Multiple settings] are not separated by anythin.

The setting statement (as all other statements) must be terminated with a semicolon (`;`).

Settings include:
table { ll
  → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/bbox[`bbox`] ☰
  → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/out[`out`] ☰ Specifies the format of the returned data. The `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/out` setting is unrelated to the `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/out` statement.
  `timeout` ☰ Duration in seconds after which a query is terminated?
  `date` ☰
  `diff` ☰
  `adiff` ☰
  `maxsize` ☰ The maximum size of memory (bytes?) allowed to process the query by the server.
table }

{ Multiple settings #overpass-multiple-settings

  Multiple settings are not separated by anything.

  The following example specifies an `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/out` and a `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/bbox` setting:
code {
[out  : csv(::id, "name", "name:de";false; '|')]
[bbox : {{bbox}}                               ];

nw [amenity=restaurant];

out;
code }

}
{ date

code {
[date:"2015-10-28T19:20:00Z"]
  …
code }

}
{ diff

code {
[diff:"2012-09-14T15:00:00Z"]
code }

code {
[diff:
  "2012-09-14T15:00:00Z",
  "2012-09-21T15:00:00Z"
]
code }

}
