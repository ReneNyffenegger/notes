$ Overpass API: settings

Overpass *settings* set optional global variables.

These settings need to be set as first → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements[statement] of an Overpass API query.

Settings declarations are enclosed in brackets []. A colon (`:`) separates the setting name from its value.

The setting statement (as all other statements) must be terminated with a semicolon (`;`).

Settings include:
table { ll
  → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/bbox[`bbox`] ☰
  → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/out[`out`] ☰
  `timeout` ☰ Duration in seconds after which a query is terminated?
  `date` ☰
  `diff` ☰
  `adiff` ☰
  `maxsize` ☰ The maximum size of memory (bytes?) allowed to process the query by the server.
table }

{ date

code {
[date:"2015-10-28T19:20:00Z"]
  …
code }

}
{ diff

code {
[diff:"2012-09-14T15:00:00Z"]
code }

code {
[diff:
  "2012-09-14T15:00:00Z",
  "2012-09-21T15:00:00Z"
]
code }

}

sa:

  The → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/out[`out`] setting.

  is unrelated to the `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/out` statement.
