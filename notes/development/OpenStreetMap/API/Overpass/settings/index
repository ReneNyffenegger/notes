$ Overpass API: settings

Overpass *settings* set optional global variables.

These settings need to be set as first → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements[statement] of an Overpass API query.

Settings declarations are enclosed in brackets []. A colon (`:`) separates the setting name from its value.

The setting statement (as all other statements) must be terminated with a semicolon (`;`).

Settings include:
table { ll
  `bbox` ☰
  → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/out[`out`] ☰
  `timeout` ☰ Duration in seconds after which a query is terminated?
  `date` ☰
  `diff` ☰
  `adiff` ☰
  `maxsize` ☰ The maximum size of memory (bytes?) allowed to process the query by the server.
table }

{ bbox

  Use the `{{bbox}}` extension:
code {
[bbox:{{bbox}}];

nw[amenity=restaurant];

out center;
code }

code {
[bbox:
    49.8727,  // min lattitude: south border
    -6.4458,  // min longitude: west border
    49.8730,  // max lattitude: north border
    -6.4452   // max longitude: east border
];

//
// Select all nodes, ways and relations in
// the area selected by the bounding box
// setting:
//
nwr;

out;
code }

  The following query gets the bounding box of the «current view»:
code {
[bbox:{{bbox}}];
out bb;
code }

}
{ date

code {
[date:"2015-10-28T19:20:00Z"]
  …
code }

}
{ diff

code {
[diff:"2012-09-14T15:00:00Z"]
code }

code {
[diff:
  "2012-09-14T15:00:00Z",
  "2012-09-21T15:00:00Z"
]
code }

}

sa:

  The → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/settings/out[`out`] setting.

  is unrelated to the `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/out` statement.
