{ TODO

  In the following query, `u(…)` is needed to prevent the *func_name() must be called in a context where it can evaluate an element* error.

code {
rel(13648941);

make x
  count     = u(count_members()),
  tags      = u(count_tags   ()),
  version   = u(version      ()),
  timestamp = u(timestamp    ()),
  changeset = u(changeset    ()),
  user      = u(user         () + ' (' +
                uid          () +  ')')
;

out;
code }

}

{ Misc

 `make` cannot take its values from an input-set.
