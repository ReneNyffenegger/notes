$ Overpass API function u
@ u

? The purpose of `u(…)` is to return a single unique value for a set (typically with exactly one member/element).
-
If the set has no element, an empty string is returned, if the set has mulitple elements with different values, `u(…)` returns `< multiple values found >`.

{ Use in foreach

  The following query finds elements whose `ele` value end in `m` or `m.` and outputs then in JSON.
code {
[out:json];
nwr[ele~'\s*m\\.?$'];

→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/foreach {
   → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/make x
    ::id   = u(id()),
//  ::type = u(type()),    // why oh why does that not work?
//    id   = u(id()),      // ::id works, therefore commented!
      type = u(type()),
      ele  = u(→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/functions/t[t]['ele']);
 
   → development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/statements/out;
}
code }

}

sa:

  Compare with the `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/functions/set` function which returns a text where the set's members's values are separated by a semicolon.
