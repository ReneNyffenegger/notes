$ Overpass API function u
@ u

? The purpose of `u(…)` is to return a single unique value for a set (typically with exactly one member/element).
-
If the set has no element, an empty string is returned, if the set has mulitple elements with different values, `u(…)` returns `< multiple values found >`.

sa:

  Compare with the `→ development/OpenStreetMap/API/Overpass/functions/set` function which returns a text where the set's members's values are separated by a semicolon.
