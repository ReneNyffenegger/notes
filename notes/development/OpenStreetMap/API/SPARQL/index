  The folowing query, which should return the peak of the → https://opendata.renenyffenegger.ch/search/Matterhorn[Matterhorn] (i.e. → https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/26863664[node 26863664]),
  does (currently?) return nothing:
code {
select *

{ osmm:type

 `osmm:type` connects a node to an OpenStreetMap node type.

  There are three such types: way (w), node (n) and relation (r):
code {
select
   distinct ?type
{
   [] osmm:type ?type .
}
code }
