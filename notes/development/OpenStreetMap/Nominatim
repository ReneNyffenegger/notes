Nominatim is an → development/OpenStreetMap API to to geocode addresses, such as → http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search.php?q=Zurlindenstrasse+215&polygon=1&viewbox=[Zurlindenstrasse 215]. It is clever enough to determine that this
address is in Zurich.

The API can be accessed, for example, through the → development/languages/Perl/modules[Perl module] → development/languages/Perl/modules/Geo/Coder/OSM[Geo::Coder::OSM].
