address is in Zurich.

The API can be accessed, for example, through the → development/languages/Perl/modules[Perl module] → development/languages/Perl/modules/Geo/Coder/OSM[Geo::Coder::OSM].

{ Format of query

  At least in Switzerland, I had better results when leaving out the zip code.

  For example
code {
Austrasse 24, 8604 Volketswil, Schweiz
code } 
found nothing, while
code {
Austrasse 24, Volketswil, Schweiz
code } 
did.
 

}
