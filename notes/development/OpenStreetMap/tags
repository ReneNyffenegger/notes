$ OpenStreetMap tags


{ Some assumptions about tags

  These are some assumptions (!!!) about tags that I used while I was working on Swiss OpenStreetMap data.

  { Buildings #buildings

    Buildings are stored in ways.

    Such ways (usually?) have a key named `building` whose value simply is `yes`.

    Optionally, such ways can have these *address* keys:
      • `addr:street`
      • `addr:housenumber`
      • `addr:city`
      • `addr:postcode`
      • `addr:country`
    

  }
  { source

    The value of a `source` key seems to indicate what entity provided the data.

    Some possible values are `Bing`, `http://www.sogis.ch SO!GIS Import`, `Yahoo aerial images`, `Stadt Zürich Open Government Data; Geomatik + Vermessung; Tiefbau- und Entsorgungsdepartement` etc.

  }
  { natural

    Some naturally found objects such as `tree`, `scrub`, `water`, `wood`, `peak`, `grassland`, `cliff` etc

    Even `yes` is found, at times!

  }

  { name

    The name of streets such as `Hauptstrasse`, `Dorfstrasse`, `Bahnhofstrasse`.

    It can also name other objecs, names such as `France - Schweiz / Suisse / Svezzira` (sic!), `Coop`, `Volg`, `Migros`, `Denner`, `UBS`, `McDonald's` were also found.

  }

    `grade1`, `grade2`, `grade3`, `grade4`, `grade5`

    `forest`, `meadow`, `farmland`, `gras`, `residential`, `farmyard`, `cemetery` etc
