A *locale* is used by applications to set the language in which input and output is processed.

A locale defines which character values a key on the keyboard corresponds to, local conventions (such as formatting of dates and numbers etc.) and culture in a geographic region etc.

Locales are identified by a string such as `de-DE`, `French_Canada` etc.
