    PTP = Picture Transfer Protocol
    -
    MTP = Media Transfer Protocol:w

    With *USB mass storage*, a device presents its data to the computer as a → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[file system].

    MTP operations are limited to enumerating files, transfering entire files and deleting a file.


    Although the P in PTP refers to pictures, the protocol can also transfer other formats found on a phone.

      [MTP and PTP] are some of those I wonder why they even have to exist. Why can’t cameras
      and phones just make it possible to mount their filesystem and access
      their files so we can work e.g. with the photos with take? It’s just
      flash memory with usually a FAT filesystem which any system can read,
      after all.
