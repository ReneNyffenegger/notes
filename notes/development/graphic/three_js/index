$ three.js

A three.js application needs at least a *scene*, a *camera* and a *renderer*.

{ Mesh

  A mesh is an object that applies a *material* to a *geometry*.

  The mesh can then be inserted into a *scene* (for example `scene.add()` and be moved around.

}
{ Object3D

  Every instance of an *Object3D* has an associated *matrix* (â†’ #matrix4) which defines the object's transformations: position, rotation and scale.

  An object's matrix-transformation is relativ to the object's parent object. The transformation relativ to the world can be optained with `obj.matrixWorld`.

}
{ Matrix4 #matrix4

}
