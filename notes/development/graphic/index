 { Khronos group

   The Khronos group develops, puplishes and maintains royalty-free interoperability standards for 3D graphics, virtual reality, augmented reality, parallel computation, vision acceleration and machine learning

   Some standerds include:
     • OpenGL
     • Vulkan
     • glTF (Graphics Library Transmission Format) - a standard format for 3D scenes and models

 }
 { Vulkan

  *Vulkan* is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and computing API. (Can it be considered the successor of
  → development/graphic/OpenGL?
  
  }
  { Quaternion

    A quaternion consists of a scalar and a vector with thee elements.
    -
    The vector represents the axis about which an object is rotated.
    -
    The scalar represents the amount or rotation.

    Quaternions are used instead of matrices because
      • matrices suffer from *Gimbal Lock*
      • Quaternions use less memory
