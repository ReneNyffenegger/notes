{ Subvolumes

  A *subvolume* has its own independnt
     • file/directory hierarchy and
     • inode numbers

  When a btfrs filesystem is created, a *top-level* subvolume is created with it. This subvolume has the id 5.
  -
  The following → Linux/kernel/command-line[Kernel command line] (which somewhat demonstrates that a subvolume was mounted) was seen on a system with a unmodified default btrfs filesystem:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/cat → Linux/fhs/proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/@rootfs/boot/vmlinuz-6.1.0-17-amd64 root=UUID=748c91ba-39f3-47ed-902d-4109bb0db688 ro rootflags=subvol=@rootfs quiet
code }

  A subvolume can be accessed
    • «normally»
    • or by mounting it.

  The inode number of a (proper) subvolume is always 256 (the implication of which is that an inode number is not unique within the entire filesystem)

  { Deleting subvolumes

    A subvolume can be deleted
      • by the owner *if* it's enabled by the mount option `user_subvol_rm_allowed`
      • by root

  }
}
