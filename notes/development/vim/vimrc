$ vimrc

`$MYVIMRC` is set to the first vimrc file that is found when searching for the vimrc file (Compare → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables/internal/$_MYVIMRC).

In order to execute an → development/vim/commands[EX command] *before* vimrc (or any other startup file) is sourced, the
→ development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options#vim-cmd-line-opt-cmd[`--cmd`] command line option can be used.


{ Default vimrc file

   TODO: found in → development/vim/sources/src/main_c#vim-src-main-source_startup_scripts[`source_startup_scripts()`]:
code {
	/*
	 * Try to read initialization commands from the following places:
	 * - environment variable VIMINIT
	 * - user vimrc file (s:.vimrc for Amiga, ~/.vimrc otherwise)
	 * - second user vimrc file ($VIM/.vimrc for Dos)
	 * - environment variable EXINIT
	 * - user exrc file (s:.exrc for Amiga, ~/.exrc otherwise)
	 * - second user exrc file ($VIM/.exrc for Dos)
	 * The first that exists is used, the rest is ignored.

code }

  The initiailization file (as also other command files) are read by → development/vim/sources/src/scriptfile_c#scriptfile_c-do_source[`do_source()`]. A speciality of this function is that it tries to read `_vimrc` if it was unable to
  read `.vimrc` (and vice versa - and similar for `.exrc`/`_exrc`). 

? If no vimrc file is found (and vim is not started with `-u NONE` or `-C`), then vim loads → development/vim/runtime/defaults_vim.
