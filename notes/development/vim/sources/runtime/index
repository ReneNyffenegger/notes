{ Maintenance

  The files under `/runtime` are → https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/5285#issuecomment-559911246[maintained by various maintainers], not by the vim project.

  So, bug reports etc. need to be directed to the maintainers directly.

}

sa:
  → development/vim/sources/src/scriptfile_c contains functions for dealing with the runtime directories/files.

  → development/vim/sources/src/misc1_c#vim-src-misc1-vim_version_dir[`vim_version_dir()` in `misc1.c`]

  The directory name of the runtime files is assigned to the macro `RUNTIME_DIRNAME` (→ development/vim/sources/src/feature_h) (typically `"runtime"`), compare with the value
  of the macro `DFLT_RUNTIMEPATH`.
