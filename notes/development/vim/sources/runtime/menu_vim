$ VIM: runtime/menu.vim

`$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim` is exectued, if `:→ development/vim/commands/filetype#vim-filetype-on[filetype on]` is executed in vim with a GUI.

Tis file is also not sourced if `M` is included in `guioptions`. Apparently, otherwise, *even* if using → development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options#vim-cmd-line-opt-u[`-U NONE -u NONE`], `menu.vim` would be sourced.
