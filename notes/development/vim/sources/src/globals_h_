$ vim - src/globals.h

`globals.h` contains the definition of global variables.

`homedir` stores the value of → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables/HOME[`$HOME`], see → development/vim/sources/src/misc1_c#vim-src-misc1_init_homedir[`init_homedir()`].

{ Windows (win_T) strucures

  Vim stores the characteristics of → development/vim/editing/windows[windows] in `win_T` structures.

  Regular (that is non-hidden (?)) windows] are stored in a *linked list*. 

 `*firstwin` points to its first entry, `*curwin` to the current window, `*lastwin` to the last entry in the linked list.

TODO:
  • `enc_utf8` (→ development/Unicode/UTF-8)
  • `default_vimruntime_dir` (declared in → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h[`src/globals.h`], defined in `pathdef.c`)
