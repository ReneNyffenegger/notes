$ VIM src/misc1.c

`misc1.c` contains functions that *didn't seem to fit elsewhere*. Compare with → development/vim/sources/src/misc2_c[misc2.c].


{ vim_getenv() #vim-src-misc1_vim_getenv

 `vim_getenv` is → development/vim[VIM's] version of `getenv()`.

  The three variables → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables#vim-three-special-dollar-variables[`$HOME`, `$VIM` and `$VIMRUNTIME`] are treated specially.

}
{ init_homedir() #vim-src-misc1_init_homedir

 `init_homedir` tries to determine the value for VIM's → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables/HOME[`$HOME`] variable.

  The value of `$HOME` will be set to that of the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `HOME`, if available.

  On → Windows, there is typically no `HOME` environment variable. Therefore, if `init_homedir` finds no `HOME` environment variable on Windows,
  it tries to assign the concatenatino of `HOMEDRIVE` and `HOMEPATH` to `PATH`. If this still fails, the value of → Windows/dirs/Users/username[`%USERPROFILE%`] is assigned, etc.
  -
  If *all* failes, the value `C:\` will be assigned.

  The value that was determined is assigned to the global variable static char_u	*homedir` (externally defined in → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h[globals.h]).

 `init_homedir()` might be called again if `encoding` changes.

  The code of `init_homedir` is duplicated in → development/vim/sources/src/dosinst_c[`dosinst.c`] (to be kept in sync…)

}
{ vim_version_dir() #vim-src-misc1-vim_version_dir

  `vim_version_dir` has one parameter, `char_u *vimdir`. The function checks if the directory `vimdir/<version>` or `vimdir/→ development/vim/sources/runtime[runtime]` exists.

   It returns NULL if not, return its name in allocated memory otherwise.
