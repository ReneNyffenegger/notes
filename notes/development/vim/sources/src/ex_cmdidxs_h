$ VIM: src/ex_cmdidxs.h

`ex_cmdidxs.h` is generated by → development/vim/sources/src/create_cmdidxs_vim[`create_cmdidxs.vim`]. It needs to be generated whenever a new
→ development/vim/commands[ex-command] is added to → development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds_h[`ex_cmds.h`].

At runtime, Vim checks if the *command table* needs to be updated in the function → development/vim/sources/src/ex_docmd_c#vim-src-ex_docmd-find_command[`find_command()`] 
(→ development/vim/sources/src/ex_docmd_c[`src/ex_docmd.c`]).

The → development/make[Makefile] contains the target `cmdidxs` which creates the the `ex_cmdidxs.h` file:
code {
$ make cmdidxs
code }

Unfortunately, I was unable to execute this make command on Wndows. Because the Makefile just executes the following line, it can also be copied and pasted:
code {
vim --clean -X -u create_cmdidxs.vim
code }
