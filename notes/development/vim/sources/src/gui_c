$ VIM: src/gui.c

{ gui_start() #vim-src-gui-gui_start

  This function is called to start a GUI.

  Apparently, it can (could?) be called recursively with a `:gui` command in the → development/vim/vimrc[.agvimrc] file.

  This function calls `gui_mch_init` (at least on Windows).

}
{ gui_wait_for_chars_buf()

  The main GUI input routine.	Waits for a character from the keyboard.
  
  `wtime`:
  • -1: Wait forever.
  • 0: Don't wait.
  • 0: Wait wtime milliseconds for a character.

  Returns the number of characters read or zero when timed out or interrupted.

 `buf` may be NULL, in which case a non-zero number is returned if characters are available.


}
{ gui_inchar() #vim-src-gui-gui_inchar

  Equivalent of `mch_inchar()` for the GUI.
