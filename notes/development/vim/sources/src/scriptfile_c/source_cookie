$ VIM: sruct source_cookie


The `source_cookie` struct is used to store info for each sourced file.

It is shared between → development/vim/sources/src/scriptfile_c#scriptfile_c-do_source[`do_source()`] and `getsourceline()`.
-
This is required, because it needs to be handed to → development/vim/sources/src/ex_docmd_c#vim-src-ex_docmd-do_cmdline[`do_cmdline()`] and
sourcing can be done recursively.

code {
struct source_cookie
{
    FILE        *fp;            // opened file for sourcing
    char_u      *nextline;      // if not NULL: line that was read ahead
    linenr_T    sourcing_lnum;  // line number of the source file
    int         finished;       // ":finish" used
#ifdef USE_CRNL
    int         fileformat;     // EOL_UNKNOWN, EOL_UNIX or EOL_DOS
    int         error;          // TRUE if LF found after CR-LF
#endif
#ifdef FEAT_EVAL
    linenr_T    breakpoint;     // next line with breakpoint or zero
    char_u      *fname;         // name of sourced file
    int         dbg_tick;       // debug_tick when breakpoint was set
    int         level;          // top nesting level of sourced file
#endif
    vimconv_T   conv;           // type of conversion
};
code }
