$ VIM: src/scriptfile.c
@ src/scriptfile.c

Functions for dealing with the → development/vim/sources/runtime[runtime directories/files].

{ do_source() #scriptfile_c-do_source

  Reads the given file (`fname`) and executs its liens as → development/vim/commands[EX commands].

  A speciality is that this function tries to read `_vimrc` if it was unable to read `.vimrc` (and vice versa), and similarly for the pair `.exrc`/`_exrc`)

? If `do_source()` read an → development/vim/vimrc[initialization (vimrc) file], it calls → development/vim/sources/src/option_c#vim-src-option-vimrc_found[`vimrc_found()`].

  The → development/vim/sources/src/vim_h#vim-src-vim_h-DOSO[`DOSO_*`] macros.
