 Communicates closely with the code in → development/vim/sources/src/ops_c[ops.c] to handle the operators.

 { nv_cmd / nv_cmds

 `nv_cmd` is a `struct` that essentially stores a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/language/datatypes/pointer/function[function pointer]
  and some flags for *one* → development/vim/editing/modes/normal[normal] or → development/vim/editing/modes/visual[visual] mode command.
  -
  The function pointer points to a function that is able to process the normal/visual mode command.

 `nv_cmds` is an array of `nv_cmd` which stores *all* possible normal or visual mode commands.

   The function pointer is called within the function `normal_cmd()`.
