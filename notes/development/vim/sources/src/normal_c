$ VIM: src/normal.c
@ src/normal.c

 `normal.c` contains the main routine for processing characters in command mode (aka → development/vim/editing/modes/normal?).
 -
 Communicates closely with the code in → development/vim/sources/src/ops_c[ops.c] to handle the operators.

 { nv_cmd / nv_cmds

 `nv_cmd` is a `struct` that essentially stores a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/language/datatypes/pointer/function[function pointer]
  and some flags for *one* → development/vim/editing/modes/normal[normal] or → development/vim/editing/modes/visual[visual] mode command.
  -
  The function pointer points to a function that is able to process the normal/visual mode command.

 `nv_cmds` is an array of `nv_cmd` which stores *all* possible normal or visual mode commands.

   The function pointer is called within the function `normal_cmd()`.

}
{ nv_colon

 `nv_colon` calls `do_cmdline` to get a command line and execute it.

}
{ normal_cmd() #vim-src-normal-normal_cmd

 `normal_cmd()` is (repeatedly) called from → development/vim/sources/src/main_c#vim-src-main_loop[`main_loop()`] (if `exmode_active` is `FALSE`) in order to process → development/vim/editing/modes/normal[normal mode] commands.

 `normal_cmd()` gets the next character from → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c#vim-src-getchar-safe_vgetc[`safe_vgetc()`].
