$ vim - src/ex_docmd.c

`ex_docmd.c` contains functions for executing an → development/vim/commands[ex command] line.

{ do_cmdline()

 `do_cmdline()` executes one Ex command line.

}
{ do_one_cmd()

  …

}
{ ex_ni()

 `ex_ni` is called for ex-commands that are not implemented.

  They're probably not implemented because they require a `FEAT_*` with which the sources were not → development/vim/compiling[compiled]:
code {
#ifndef FEAT_PRINTER
# define ex_hardcopy	ex_ni
#endif
code }

}
