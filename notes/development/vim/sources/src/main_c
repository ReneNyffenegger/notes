{ main / VimMain #vim-src-main-main

  `main.c` defines → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/main[`main`].
   -
   In Windows environments, instead of `main`, `VimMain` is defined (and called from `wWinMain`, found in → development/vim/sources/src/os_w32exe_c[`os_w32exe.c`]):
code {
    int
# ifdef MSWIN
VimMain
# else
main
# endif
code }

  Some functions that `main()` calls include
    • → development/vim/sources/src/map_c#vim-src-map-init_mappings[`init_mappings()`]
    • `init_highlight()`
    • → #vim-src-main-exe_pre_commands[`exe_pre_commands()`] (which executes the commands that were given by the → development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options#vim-cmd-line-opt-cmd[command line option `--cmd`]
    • → #vim-src-main-source_startup_scripts[`source_startup_scripts()`]

  The last function that `main()` calls is `vim_main2()`.


}
{ vim_main2

  If compiled with `+eval`, reads all the plugin files.

  Some of the functions that `vim_main2` calls include
    • `set_init_3()`
    • `gui_start()`
    • `exe_commands()` (which executes `+`, `-c` and `-S` → development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options[command line options])

  At the function's end, it calls → #vim-src-main_loop[`main_loop()`] (which does not return).

}
{ exe_pre_commands() #vim-src-main-exe_pre_commands

  Execute → development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options#vim-cmd-line-opt-cmd[`--cmd`] commands

}
{ source_startup_scripts() #vim-src-main-source_startup_scripts

  Sources startup files such as → development/vim/vimrc[vimrc] etc.

}
{ main_loop #vim-src-main_loop

 `main_loop` executes → development/vim/editing/modes/normal[normal mode] commands until vim is terminated by calling → development/vim/sources/src/normal_c#vim-src-normal-normal_cmd[`normal_cmd()`.

 `main_loop` is also used in the command-line window until that window is closed.
