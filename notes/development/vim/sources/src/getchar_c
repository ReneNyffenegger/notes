{ vgetc()

  Get the next input character.

  Can return a special key or a multi-byte character.

  Can return NUL when called recursively, use `safe_vgetc()` if that's not wanted.

  This translates escaped K_SPECIAL and CSI bytes to a K_SPECIAL or CSI byte.

  Collects the bytes of a multibyte character into the whole character.

  Returns the modifiers in the global "mod_mask".

}
{ vgetorpeek()

  Get a «byte»

}
{ inchar()

 `inchar()` gets one character from a script file or the keyboard.

}
{ input_available() #vim-src-getchar-input_available

  Return `TRUE` when bytes are in the *input buffer* or in the typeahead buffer.

  Normally the input buffer would be sufficient, but the `server_to_input_buf()`
  or `feedkeys()` may insert characters in the typeahead buffer while we are
  waiting for input to arrive.
