$ VIM struct: sctx_T

The `sctx_T` struct stores a *SCript ConteXt*, aka *SCTX*.

A script context identifies a script line.

? When sourcing a script, `sc_lnum` is zero, `sourcing_lnum` is the current line number.
  -
  When executing a user function `sc_lnum` is the line where the function was defined, `sourcing_lnum` is the line number inside the function.
  -
  When stored with a function, mapping, option, etc. `sc_lnum` is the line number in the script `sc_sid`.

code {
typedef struct {
    scid_T	sc_sid;		// script ID (scid_T is → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/language/typedef[typedef'd] to an int)
    int		sc_seq;		// sourcing sequence number
    linenr_T	sc_lnum;	// line number (linenr_T is typedef'd to a long)
    int		sc_version;	// :scriptversion
} sctx_T;
code }

sa:
  A pointer to a `sctx_T` is for example used in the → development/vim/sources/src/autocmd_c/AutoCmd[`AutoCmd` struct].
