$ VIM struct: garray_T

The struct `growarray` (typedef `garray_T`) is used for *growing arrays*.

Growing arrays grow only and and are then deleted all at once.

Growing arrays are accessed using an index.

Functions that deal with growing arrays start with → development/vim/sources/src/misc2_c#vim-src-misc2-ga_[`ga_…()`] and are defined in → development/vim/sources/src/misc2_c[`misc2.c`].

code {
typedef struct growarray
{
    int	    ga_len;		    // current number of items used
    int	    ga_maxlen;		    // maximum number of items possible
    int	    ga_itemsize;	    // sizeof(item)
    int	    ga_growsize;	    // number of items to grow each time
    void    *ga_data;		    // pointer to the first item
} garray_T;
code }
