$ VIM struct: wininfo_T

The `wininfo_T` struct stores information that pertains to a → development/vim/editing/windows[Window] stored with a → development/vim/editing/buffers[buffer].

Two types of info are kept for a buffer which are associated with a specific window:
  • Each window can have a different line number associated with a buffer.
  • The window-local options for a buffer work in a similar way.

The window-info is kept in a list at `b_wininfo`. It is kept in most-recently-used order.

code {
typedef struct wininfo_S wininfo_T;

struct wininfo_S
{
    wininfo_T   *wi_next;       // next entry or NULL for last entry
    wininfo_T   *wi_prev;       // previous entry or NULL for first entry
    win_T       *wi_win;        // pointer to window that did set wi_fpos
    pos_T       wi_fpos;        // last cursor position in the file
    int         wi_optset;      // TRUE when wi_opt has useful values
    → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/winopt_T[winopt_T]    wi_opt;         // local window → development/vim/options[options]
#ifdef FEAT_FOLDING
    int         wi_fold_manual; // copy of w_fold_manual
    garray_T    wi_folds;       // clone of w_folds
