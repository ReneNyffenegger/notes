{ get_exe_name() #vim-src-os_win32-get_exe_name

  Determines the value of the global variable → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-exe_name[`exe_name`].

}
{ dyn_libintl_init()

  This functions seems to try to find the addresses of the → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL functions
    • `gettext`
    • `ngettext`
    • `textdomain`
    • `bindtextdomain`
    

}
{ get_cmd_argsW

 `get_cmd_argsW` uses the → Windows/development/WinAPI function `CommandLineToArgvW` to fill `argc` and `argv`.
  
  It seems that the authors of the VIM source don't trust the values passed with the respective values of the
 `main()` function (possibly because the MinGW environment already does some filename globbing).

}
{ mch_is_gui_executable #vim-src-os_win32-mch_is_gui_executable

 `mch_is_gui_executable` checks if the → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem of the
 → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executable] is
 → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem/console[console] or
 → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem/GUI[GUI]
