$ VIM: src/create_cmdidxs.vim

`create_cmdidxs.vim` creates the file → development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmdidxs_h[`ex_cmdidxs.h`] which contains the two arrays `cmdidxs1[]` and `cmdidxs2[][]`.

`create_cmdidxs.vim` needs to be run whenever a new → /development/vim/commands[EX command] has been added to → development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds_h[`ex_cmds.h`].
