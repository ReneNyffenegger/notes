Contains text that can be discarded at any time.  It is kept
    when closing the window, it must be deleted explicitly.
    Settings:
      :setlocal buftype=nofile
      :setlocal bufhidden=hide
      :setlocal noswapfile
    The buffer name can be used to identify the buffer, if you
    give it a meaningful name.
