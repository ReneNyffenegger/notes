$ Vim: buffers

? Buffers are essentially files that are loaded in → development/vim.

{ Buffer list #vim-buffer-list

  → development/vim/commands/ls,
  → development/vim/options/buflisted

  The buffer list might be stored in a → development/vim/editing/viminfo[viminfo file].

}
{ Buffers in a window

  What happens to a buffer when it is no longer displayed in a window is determined
  with → development/vim/options/bufhidden.

}
{ Alternate buffer #vim-alternate-buffer

  The name of the alternate buffer is stored in the → development/vim/registers[`#` register]

}
{ Scratch buffer #vim-scratch-buffer

  `:help buffers`, scrolling down to `scratch` says:

code {
Contains text that can be discarded at any time.  It is kept
    when closing the window, it must be deleted explicitly.
    Settings:
      :setlocal buftype=nofile
      :setlocal bufhidden=hide
      :setlocal noswapfile
    The buffer name can be used to identify the buffer, if you
    give it a meaningful name.
code }

  → development/vim/options/bufhidden,
  → development/vim/options/buftype,
  → development/vim/options/swapfile

{ vim internals

  { Linked list of buffers

    The vim sources store all buffers in a linked list.

    The global variables `firstbuf`, `lastbuf` and `curbuf` (→ development/vim/sources/src/globals_h[globals.h]) point to the respective entry in this list.
