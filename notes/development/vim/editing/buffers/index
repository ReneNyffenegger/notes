$ Vim: buffers

? Buffers are essentially files that are loaded in → development/vim.

Multiple → development/vim/editing/windows[windows] can show a portion of the same buffer concurrently.

{ Buffer list #vim-buffer-list

  → development/vim/commands/ls,
  → development/vim/options/buflisted

  The buffer list might be stored in a → development/vim/editing/viminfo[viminfo file].

}
{ Buffers in a window

  What happens to a buffer when it is no longer displayed in a window is determined
  with → development/vim/options/bufhidden.

}
{ Alternate buffer #vim-alternate-buffer

  The name of the alternate buffer is stored in the → development/vim/registers[`#` register]

}
{ Scratch buffer #vim-scratch-buffer

  `:help buffers`, scrolling down to `scratch` says:

code {
Contains text that can be discarded at any time.  It is kept
    when closing the window, it must be deleted explicitly.
    Settings:
      :setlocal buftype=nofile
      :setlocal bufhidden=hide
      :setlocal noswapfile
    The buffer name can be used to identify the buffer, if you
    give it a meaningful name.
code }

  → development/vim/options/bufhidden,
  → development/vim/options/buftype,
  → development/vim/options/swapfile


}
{ Special buffers

  Special buffers are
    • help buffer (used for help files)
    • spell buffer (used for spelling information)

  The help buffer never uses a swap file.

  The spell buffer is never displayed and does not have a file name.

}

{ vim internals

  { Linked list of buffers

    The vim sources store all buffers in a linked list.

    The global variables `firstbuf` and `lastbuf`, whose type is → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/buf_T[`buf_T*`], point to the first and last
    entry in this linked list (→ development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-linked-list-of-buffer[globals.h]).

  }
  { Currently active buffer

    One (or at most one?) buffer is active. This buffer is pointed to by the global variable 

  }

}

sa:
  → development/vim/editing/windows[windows]

  → development/vim/sources/src/buffer_c[`buffer.c`]

  The → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/wininfo_T[`wininfo_T`] struct stores information that pertains to a → development/vim/editing/windows[Window] stored with a buffer.
