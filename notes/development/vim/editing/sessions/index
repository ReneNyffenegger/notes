$ Vim sessions

{ Session files

  The state of a complete vim session (when → development/vim/editing[editing] files) can be saved to
  a session file.
  -
  So, multiple session files are possible, one for each project someone is working on.
  -
  In contrast, there is usually only one → development/vim/editing/viminfo[viminfo] file which does not depend on what someone is working on.

  After loading a (previously stored) session file, the user can resume work where he
  abandoned it.

}
{ Options

  The behavior of the → development/vim/commands/mksession[`:mksession`] command is controlled by the
  → development/vim/options/sessionoptions option.

}
{ Events

  When a session is loaded, the `SessionLoadPost` → development/vim/events[event] is triggered.

}
{ Command line options

  → development/vim/editing/start-up/command-line-options#vim-cmd-line-opt-S can apparently be used to source a `Session.vim` (session) file.

}

  → development/vim
