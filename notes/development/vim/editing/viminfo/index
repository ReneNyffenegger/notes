    • The input-line history.
    • Contents of non-empty registers.
    • Marks for several files.
    • File marks, pointing to locations in files.

    • The → development/vim/editing/buffers#vim-buffer-list[buffer list].
    • Global → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables[variables].

  If such a viminfo file is used is controlled by the → development/vim/options/viminfo[`viminfo`] → development/vim/options[option].
