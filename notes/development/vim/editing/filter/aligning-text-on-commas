$ Vim: aligning text on commas

Visually select the text to be aligned.

Press `:` to go into command mode.

Press `!` to indicate that the selected text needs to be filtered through an external program.

Use `→ development/languages/sed[sed] 's/,/,@/g' | → Linux/shell/commands/column[column] -s@ -t` as the external programm.

`sed` first replaces all `,` with `@,`. `column` then aligns on `@` (specified with `-s`).
