$ Vim: windows


{ vim internals

  Information about a window is stored in the → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/window_S[`window_S` struct].

  The first window (and its → development/vim/editing/buffers[buffer]) is created in → development/vim/sources/src/window_c#vim-src-window-win_alloc_first[`win_alloc_first()`] (`window.c`);

  { Linked list of windows

    The vim sources store all windows (that are not hidden?) in a linked list.

    The global variables → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals-h_window-linked-list[`firstwin`, `lastwin` and `curwin`] (→ development/vim/sources/src/globals_h[globals.h]) point to the respective entry in this list.

  }
  { Window frame tree

    The layout is practically a tree of frames whose root is pointed at by the global variable `topframe`.

  }
