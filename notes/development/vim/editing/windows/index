  { Linked list of windows

    The vim sources store all windows (that are not hidden?) in a linked list.

    The global variables `firstwin`, `lastwin` and `curwin` (→ development/vim/sources/src/globals_h[globals.h]) point to the respective entry in this list.

  }
  { Window frame tree

    The layout is practically a tree of frames whose root is pointed at by the global variable `topframe`.

  }
