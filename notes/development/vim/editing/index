{ Entering characters by hex or Unicode value

  In order to enter → development/Unicode character `abcd`, type `ctrl-v` and `u`:  `^vuabcd`.

  A hex character is entered by preceding it by `ctrl-v` and `x`. The range is limited to 00 - ff, however.

  In order to determine the ascii value of a character *under the cursor*, `ga` or `g8` might be used. (Apparently,
  this is also possible with the → development/vim/commands[ex command] `:ascii`. Compare `ga` and `g8` with `g ctrl-g` which prints the cursor's column, line, word, character and byte).

}

{ TODO

  
  *Virtual editing* allows to move the cursor to positions *after* the last character in a line.
