  TODO: Apparently, mappings are (also?) handled in → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c#vim-src_getchar-vgetorpeek[`vgetorpeek()`] (`handle_mapping`).

  → development/vim/editing/modes/insert[Insert mode] and → development/vim/editing/modes/command-line[command line mode] mappings are disabled if the option → development/vim/options/paste is turned on.
