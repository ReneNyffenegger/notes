$ VIM: the black hole register

The black hole register is identified by an underscore (`_`).

The *black hole* → development/vim/registers[register] is especially useful when the → development/vim/commands/g[global command (`g`)] is used to delete a lot of lines. Because the deleted lines are not copied into a «real» register,
such an operation is allegedly sped up.
