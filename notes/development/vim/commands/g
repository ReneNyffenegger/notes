{ Extracting text from a buffer into a register

Here's a file:
code {
some text
# xyz: one
more text
foo bar baz
# xyz: second
final text
# xyz: final words
The end.
code }

I want to extract all text after `# xyz:`

I can do that with the global command:
code {
:let @a='' | g/^# xyz:/let @A=substitute(getline('.'), '^# xyz: \(.*\)', '\1' . nr2char(10), '')
code }

  After executing this command, the → development/vim/registers[register] `a` contains
code {
one
second
final words
code }

}
