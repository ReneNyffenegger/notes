$ Vim ex command: scriptnames

`:scriptnames` lists all scripts that were sourced in chronological sequences.

This might be helpful in order to determine which vimrc file was used when vim started up.

The functionality is implemented in the function `ex_scriptnames()` (â†’ development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds2_c[ex_cmds2.c])
