$ Vim: ex commands

`:help ex-cmd-index` gives a list of all the `:` commands (without mentioning any arguments, however).

A (repetitive) sequence of ex commands can be stored in a
→ development/vim/user-defined-functions[user defined function] (and then repeatedly called).

`:profile file [pattern]` profiles the performance of plugins.

sa:

  → development/vim/sources/src/ex_docmd_c[src/ex_docmd.c] contains functions for executing an ex command line.
  -
  Ex commands are defined in → development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds_h.

  The function → development/vim/sources/src/scriptfile_c#scriptfile_c-do_source[`do_source()`] (→ development/vim/sources/src/scriptfile_c) reads a file and executes its lines as ex commands.

  The struct `exarg` (→ development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds_h[ex_cmds.h]) stores the arguments used for ex commands.
