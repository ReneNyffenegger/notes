$ Vim: ex commands

`:help ex-cmd-index` gives a list of all the `:` commands (without mentioning any arguments, however).

A (repetitive) sequence of ex commands can be stored in a
→ development/vim/user-defined-functions[user defined function] (and then repeatedly called).

sa:

  → development/vim/sources/src/ex_docmd_c[src/ex_docmd.c] contains functions for executing an ex command line.

  The function `do_source()` (→ development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds2_c[ex_cmds2.c]) reads a file and executes its lines as ex commands.

  The struct `exarg` (ex_cmds.h) stores the argumets used for ex commands.
