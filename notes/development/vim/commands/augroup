$ Vim ex command: augroup
@ augroup

Apparently, the purpose of `augroup` is to prevent to define autocommands multiple times if a
file is sourced multple times:
code {
:augroup TQ84
:  → development/vim/commands/autocmd[autocommand]!    " Exclamation mark: remove all autocommands in autogroup TQ84
:  → development/vim/commands/augroup  events[event]   *.suffx command
:  → development/vim/commands/augroup  events[event-2] *.suffx command-2
:augroup END
code }

sa:
  → development/vim/commands/augroup,
  → development/vim/events
