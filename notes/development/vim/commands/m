$ Vim ex commands: m, t and co
@ m, t and co

`:m` is an abbreviation for `:move`, `:t` and `:co` are abbreviations for `:copy`.

Move/copy current line to the end of the → development/vim/editing/buffers[buffer]:
code {
:m$
:t$
code }

Move the line after two lines below cursor to end of the buffer:
code {
:+2m$
code }

Copy three lines, starting after two lines, to beginning of buffer. Spaces are not required, here included for readabilty:
code {
:+2,+4 t 0
code }

`t` and `m` are especially useful with the → development/vim/commands/g[global (`g`) command]. The following command moves all lines that match `pattern` to the end of the buffer:
code {
:g/pattern/m$
code }
