$ vim option: magic
@ magic

The (boolean) value of `magic` specifies how the backslash changes the meaning of the following character when constructing
→ development/vim/regular-expressions[regular expressions].

{ nomagic

  If the value turned *off (or to *nomagic*), all except three characters match themselves. The three exceptions are
    • `^` (match start of line),
    • `$` (match end of line) and
    • `\` (in order to change the meanning of the following character).

  So, in nomagic mode, `..f*` matches only if it finds exactly two dots followed by one f followed by a star.

  In order to use the full power of the regular expression notation, a lot of backslashes are required. In order to match any two characters followed by zero or more f's, the following pattern must be used:
 `\.\.f\*`.

{ magic

  The intention of magic is to make it easier for the user to enter regular expression by removing the requirement to preceede a regular expression instruction with a backslash.
  -
  This mode is magic because characters magically change their meaning.

  These three characters are `*`, `.` and `~`, resulting in the following three differences between magic and nomagic:
  table { lll
    ~magic~ ☰ ~nomagic~ ☰ ~meaning~
    `*` ☰ `\*` ☰ Zero or more
    `.` ☰ `\.` ☰ Any character
    `~` ☰ `\~` ☰ Latest substitute string
  table }

}
{ Very magic

 *Very magic* goes a step further than magic.

  With very magic, all ASCII characters except `0`…`9`, `a`…`A`, `A`…`Z` and `_` become a a special meaning. In this mode, searching for text becomes very magic.

}

{ Changing the default of magic to nomagic

  It is adviced not to set `nomagic` in VIM scripts prior to → development/vim/script/9[VIM 9 script] because this might break scripts that rely on having `magic` (which the default) set.

  This becomes less of a problem with VIM 9 scripts because they ignore the value of `magic`.

  It is also possible to force a regexp-pattern to be interpreted as though `magic` was set by using `\m` and to be interpreted as though `nomagic` was set by using `\M`.
  (See also `\v` and `\V`)
