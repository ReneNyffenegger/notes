$ vim option: magic
@ magic

The (boolean) value of `magic` specifies how special characters can be used in search patterns of
→ development/vim/regular-expressions[regular expressions]. Noteable examples of differences are:
table { lll
  ~magic~ ☰ ~nomagic~ ☰ ~meaning~
  `*` ☰ `\*` ☰ Zero or more
  `.` ☰ `\.` ☰ Any character
  `~` ☰ `\~` ☰ Latest substitute string
table }


{ Chaning the default of magic to nomagic

  It is adviced not to set `nomagic` in VIM scripts prior to → development/vim/script/9[VIM 9 script] because this might break scripts that rely on having `magic` (which the default) set.

  This becomes less of a problem with VIM 9 scripts because they ignore the value of `magic`.

  It is also possible to force a regexp-pattern to be interpreted as though `magic` was set by using `\m` and to be interpreted as though `nomagic` was set by using `\M`.
  (See also `\v` and `\V`)
