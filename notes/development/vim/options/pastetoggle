$ vim option: pastetoggle
@ pastetoggle

*pastetoggle* is a string option that allows to assign a key-sequence that toggles the → development/vim/options/paste option. This special handling is necessary because when *paste* is turned on,
→ development/vim/editing/mappings[mappings] and → development/vim/editing/abbreviations[abbreviations] are disabled.
