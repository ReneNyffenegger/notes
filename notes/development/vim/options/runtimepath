$ vim option: runtimepath

This option specifies a list of (comma separated) directories that are searched for *runtime files* (such as when → development/vim/commands/colorscheme[:colorscheme]) is executed).

On most systems, the default contains five locations:
table { ll
  home directory ☰ Personal (local) preferences
  System wide Vim directory ☰ Global preferences, as deemed fit by the administrator
  → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables/VIMRUNTIME[`$VIMRUNTIME`] ☰ that contains files that were distributed with Vim (and are also stored in Vim's → development/vim/options/runtimepath[github repository])
  `after/` in the system wide directory ☰
  `after/` in the home directory ☰
table }

? *packages* adds more entries to the `runtimepath`.

If `→ development/vim/commands/set[:set] rtp` prints a truncated outout, `→ development/vim/commands/echo[:echo] &rtp` prints the complete value.

{ Runtime files

  Vim's documentation seems to indicate that the following files and directories belong to the «runtime files»:
  table { ll
    → development/vim/runtime/filetype_vim[`filetype.vim`] ☰ filetypes by file name
