$ vim option: paste
@ paste

Setting `paste`
  • disables → development/vim/editing/mappings[mappings] in → development/vim/editing/modes/insert[insert mode] and → development/vim/editing/modes/command-line[command line mode].
  • disables → development/vim/editing/abbreviations[abbreviations]
  • the options → development/vim/options/autoindent, → development/vim/options/expandtab, → development/vim/options/revins, → development/vim/options/ruler, → development/vim/options/showmatch, → development/vim/options/smartindent, → development/vim/options/smarttab are reset
  • the options → development/vim/options/softtabstop, → development/vim/options/textwidth and → development/vim/options/wrapmargin are set to 0
  • the effects of the options → development/vim/options/cindent[`cindent`], → development/vim/options/indentexpr[`indentexpr`] and → development/vim/options/lisp[`lisp`] (but these options keep their values)

Because abbreviations and mappings are disabled, the special string-option → development/vim/commands/pastetoggle allows to define a key sequence that still switches back to *nopaste* in paste mode.
