$ vim option: compatible

When this option is set, it empties → development/vim/options/indentexpr[indentexpr]

In the source code, the value of the compatible option is stored in `c_cp` which is (externally) declared in → development/vim/sources/src/option_h[`option.h`].

Executing `:set compatible` or `:set nocompatible` eventually calls → development/vim/sources/src/option_c#vim-src-option-compatible_set[`compatible_set()`].

{ Differences between compatible and nocompatible

  To be finished…!

  table { lll
      ☰ compatible ☰ nocompatible
    Filename completion (`:e …`) ☰ ctrl-e ☰ tab

  table }

}
{ Overwritting other options #nocompatible-overwrite-options

  Setting `nocompatible` overwrites at the → development/vim/options/viminfo[`viminfo`] option, therefore, `→ development/vim/commands/set nocompatible` should be placed at the
  beginning of the → development/vim/vimrc[vimrc file], see → https://stackoverflow.com/a/32943292/180275[this stackoverflow answer].

  Other options that `set nocompatible` also overwrites include
    • → development/vim/options/cindent[`cindent`]
    • and more???

}

sa:

  Because → development/vim/options/compatible#nocompatible-overwrite-options[`set nocompatible` overwrites other options], it should be placed at the beginning
  of the → development/vim/vimrc[vimrc file].

  → development/vim/options
