$ vim option: compatible

When this option is set, it empties → development/vim/options/indentexpr[indentexpr]

In the source code, the value of the compatible option is stored in `c_cp` which is (externally) declared in → development/vim/sources/src/option_h[`option.h`].

Executing `:set compatible` or `:set nocompatible` eventually calls → development/vim/sources/src/option_c#vim-src-option-compatible_set[`compatible_set()`].

sa:
  → development/vim/options
