$ vim option: sessionoptions
@ sessionoptions

Controls the behavior of the → development/vim/commands/mksession[`:mksession`] command.

Apparently, in order to write session files that can be read, written and understood in both unix and windows,
`sessionoptions` should at least contain `unix` and `slash`:
code {
set sessionoptions+=unix,slash
code }
