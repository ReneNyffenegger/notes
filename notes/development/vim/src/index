  In a → Windows environment, these macros might be defined in → development/vim/sources/src/os_dos_h[`os_dos.h`].

  Compare with → development/vim/features[features] that are also defined as → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macros].


}
{ Misc

  { Line/cursor numbering

    Vim uses line and column numbers to refer to a position *on* a character (*not* between two characters).

  }

}
{ TODO

  { Keyboard handling

    CSI stands for *control sequence introducer*. Related macros seem to be `CSI`, `CSI_STR`, `KS_CSI`, `KE_CSI`, `T_CSI` (see also `add_to_input_buf_csi()` in → development/vim/sources/src/ui_c[`ui.c`]).

    The global variable `mod_mask` is set by `vgetc()` to the set of *modifiers* that are held down based on the `MOD_MASK_…` symboles that are read first.

  }
  { Buffers

    There seem to be some buffer types:
      • → development/vim/sources/src/ui_c#vim-input-buffer[input buffer]
      • stuff buffer (? A command that is translated into another command, like `D` -> `d$`, or to redo a command (`.`))
      • typeahead buffer (stores text that is already obtainexd but not yet used, and results of mappings, and is used for the `:normal` command. represented by a → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/typebuf_T[`typebuf_T`] struct.
      • read buffer (compare → development/vim/sources/src/edit_c#vim-src-edit-stuff_inserted[`stuff_inserted()`], → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c#vim-src-getchar-read_readbuffers[`read_readbuffers()`])
      • redo buffer (? to redo the last change)
      • recording buffer (for the `q` command)
      • … ?

    The → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/buffheader_T[`buffheader_T`] struct and some → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c#vim-src-getchar-buffheader_T-variables[variables of this struct in `getchar.c`].

    The contents of the *stuff buffer* and the mapped characters in the *typeahead buffer* is removed in the function
    → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c#vim-src-getchar-flush_buffers[`flush_buffers()`].

    Structs:
       • → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/buffblock_T[`buffblock_T`] is used to store *one block* of the stuff/redo/recording buffers.
       • → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/buffheader_T[`buffheader_T`] is used for the *stuff buffer* and the *redo buffer*.
       • → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/typebuf_T[`typebuf_T`] is used for the *typeahead buffer*.
       • → development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/tasave_T[`tasave_T`] holds the saved *typeahead* (for `save_typeahead()`).

    The input buffer seems to be filled mainly with characters that are typed on a keyboard (see for example → development/vim/sources/src/gui_w32_c#vim-src-gui_w32-_OnChar[`_OnChar` in `gui_w32.c`].
    -
    As per two comment in → development/vim/sources/src/gui_c[`gui.c`] (`gui_send_mouse_event()` and `gui_drag_scrollbar()`), the input buffer seems also able to store *mouse events* and scrollbar draging information.

   `typebuf.tb_buf` (whose middle part has room for *typeahead*.

    As per a comment in → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c[`getchar.c`] (`save_typeahead`), there are *three kinds of typeahead*.

    → development/vim/sources/src/getchar_c#vim-src-getchar-ins_typebuf[`ins_typebuf()`] inserts a string into the *typeahead buffer*.

?  `feedkeys()` or `server_to_input_buf()` might insert characters into the *typeahead buffer* (while wating for input to arrive).

    → development/vim/sources/src/ex_docmd_c[`ex_docmd.c`] has the interesting comment
    "
	    Execute from the typeahead buffer.
      -
	    Continue until the stuff buffer is empty and all added characters
	    have been consumed.
    "

  }
  { Screen

    There are three levels for screen drawing/painting, from top to bottom:
      • → development/vim/sources/src/drawscreen_c[`drawscreen.c`]
      • → development/vim/sources/src/drawline_c[`drawline.c`]
      • → development/vim/sources/src/screen_c[`screen.c`]

    Global variables that are used in concjunction with the screen, defined in → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h[`globals.h`] are
    table { ll
      `long Columns` and `Rows`                 ☰ Number of columns/rows on the screen
      `char_u *ScreenLines`                     ☰ Characters on the screen
      `u8char_T* ScreenLinesUC`                 ☰ Decoded UTF-8 characters
      `unsigned short *ScreenAttrs`             ☰ These characters' attributes
      `unsigned *LineOffset`                    ☰
      `int screen_Rows` and `screen_columns`    ☰ actual size of `ScreenLines`
      `char_u   LineWraps`                      ☰
      `u8char_T* ScreenLinesC`                  ☰ Composing characters
      `char_u *current_ScreenLine`              ☰ Buffer for one screen line (? characters and attributres)
      `int screen_cur_row` and `screen_cur_col` ☰ Last known cursor position, mostly used by `windgoto()` and `screen_char()`
      `→ development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/match_T[match_T] screen_search_hl` ☰ used for `hlsearch` highlight matching
      `→ development/vim/sources/src/structs_h/foldinfo_T[foldinfo_T] win_foldinfo ☰ info for `foldcolumn`
    table }

  }
  { K_…

   `K_SPECIAL` introduces a special key (in a buffer?) and is followed by two bytes.
   -
   A literal `K_SPECIAL` is stored as `K_SPECIAL KS_SPECIAL` `KE_FILLER`.

  }
