$ $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/synload.vim

This files sets up syntax highlighting: it loads the syntax autocommands and sets the default methods for highlighting.

The file is loaded via → development/vim/runtime/syntax/syntax_vim or → development/vim/runtime/syntax/manual_vim.

If the variable `colors_name` was not set, it loads → development/vim/runtime/syntax/syncolor_vim, otherwise it executes `"colors " . colors_name`.
