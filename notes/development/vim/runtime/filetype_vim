$ $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim

`$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim` is used to detect file types.
-
It contains lines such as
code {
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.tyb,*.typ,*.tyc,*.pkb,*.pks	setf sql
code }

`$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim` is run when `:→ development/vim/commands/filetype#vim-filetype-on[filetype on]` is executed.


? If it's not possible to detect tye file type by its name (mostly suffix), then vim uses
→ development/vim/runtime/scripts_vim[`$VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim`] to determine a file type.
