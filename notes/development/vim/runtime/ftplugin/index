$ VIM runtime: ftplugin

The `ftplugin/` directory contains vim scripts («plugins») that are specific to specific filetypes.

? As soon as vim detects a filetype (for example `foo`) *and* → development/vim/commands/filetype[`:filetype plugin on`] was executed, it sources all files in this directory and its subdirectories whose file names match `foo.vim` or `foo_*.vim`.
