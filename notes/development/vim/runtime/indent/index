$ $VIMRUNTIME/indent

`indent/` contains Vim scripts that assist the editor of a given file type with indenting the file.

{ Rules for an indent file

code {
" Only load this indent file when no other was loaded yet.

if exists("b:did_indent")
   finish
endif

let b:did_indent = 1
code }


To trigger the indenting after typing a key word like `endif`, add the word to the `cinkeys` option with `+=`.

You normally set `indentexpr` to evaluate a function and then define that function.

That function only needs to be defined once for as long as Vim is
running.  Add a test if the function exists and use ":finish", like this:
code {
if exists("*GetMyIndent")
   finish
endif
code }

  To test the indent file, see `testdir/README.txt`.

}
