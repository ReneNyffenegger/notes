    • number
    • float
    • string
    • list (array)
    • dictionary (hash)

    • special
    • job
    • channel
    • blbo

  See also `→ development/vim/script/vimscript/functions/type[type()]`

{ TODO

  Global variables might be stored in the → development/vim/editing/viminfo[viminfo file].

  { v: variables

    `set_vim_var_string` (→ development/vim/sources/src/misc1_c[eval.c])

    `v:` variables are identified with the `VV_` macros (→ development/vim/sources/src/vim_h[vim.h]).

    `v:lang` and `v:lc_time` are set according to the *current → development/locale settings* (`set_lang_var` in → development/vim/sources/src/ex_cmds2_c[ex_cmds2.c]).

  }
  { Three special $ variables #vim-three-special-dollar-variables

    `$HOME`, `$VIM` and `$VIMRUNTIME` (see `vim_getenv` in → development/vim/sources/src/misc1_c[`src/misc.c`]).
    -
    Apparently, the `$VIMRUNTIME` must not end in a *backslash* (on Windows).
