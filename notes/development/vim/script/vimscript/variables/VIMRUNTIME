$ VIM variables: $VIMRUNTIME

The → development/environment-variable[(environment) variable] `$VIMRUNTIME` points to the directory that contains the → development/vim/sources/runtime[runtime] files that are distributed along with vim.

Usually, the value of `$VIMRUNTIME` is not explicitely defined by a user.
-
If the variable `VIMRUNTIME` is not defined, vim tries to determine the runtime directory in the function → development/vim/sources/src/misc1_c#vim-src-misc1_vim_getenv[`vim_getenv()`] by using the value of the
  • development/vim/options/helpfile[helpfile] option
  • the name of the executable (`argv[0]` and/or global variable development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-exe_name[`exe_name`])

The value of the global variable → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-pathdef_c[`default_vimruntime_dir`] seems to be a fallback value.

If vim determined the value for `$VIMRUNTIME`, it also sets the value of → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-didset_vim[`didset_vimruntime`] to `TRUE`.

sa:

  The option → development/vim/options/runtimepath[`runtimepath`] contains a comma separated list of directories that will be searched for *runtime files*.
 
  → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables/VIM[`$VIM`]

  Vim's → development/vim/options/runtimepath[github repository direcotry] that contains these files.
