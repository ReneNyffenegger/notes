$ VIM variables: $VIM

`$VIM` belongs to the → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables#vim-three-special-dollar-variables[three special `$` variables], the other two being → development/vim/script/vimscript/variables/HOME[`$HOME`] and `VIMRUNTIME`.

? If the environment variable `VIM` is not defined, `$VIM` might be assigned a value that is dependent on the value of → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-exe_name[`exe_name`], at least if running
on Windows, that is.
-
Another fallback for `$VIM` seems to be the value of the global variable → development/vim/sources/src/globals_h#vim-src-globals_h-pathdef_c[`default_vim_dir`],
see → development/vim/sources/src/misc1_c#vim-src-misc1_vim_getenv[`vim_getenv()`].
