$ vim script: writefile

code {
writefile({object}, {fname} [, {flags}])
code }

If `flags` contains a
  • `"b"` then binary mode is used
  • `"a"` then append mode is used which causes the data in `object` to be appended to the file. (By default, the content of the file is replaced)
  • `"s"` then `fsync()` is called after writing the file
  • `"S"` then `fsync()` is not called even if `fsync` is set

If `flags` does not contain an `s` or `S`, `fsync()` is called only if `fsync` is set.
