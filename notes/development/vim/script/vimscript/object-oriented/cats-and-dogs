$ Object oriented vim script: cats and dogs

This is a totally simple vim scriptlet to demonstrate object oriented inheritance with vim script. The base class is `Animal`. It contains the member variables `name` and `typicalSound` and
the member function `sayName()`.

`sayName()` assembles a string by combining `typicalSound` with the `name` and â†’ development/vim/script/vimscript/functions/echo[echoes] it.

Two classes are derived from `Animal`: `Dog` and `Cat`. Objects of these types can be instantiated with `let var = Dog.new(name)`. After that, the
animal can be made say its name by calling `var.sayName()`.
