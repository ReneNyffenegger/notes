$ Vim events

Vim has a few events. They can be hooked to execute → development/vim/commands[commands]. This feature accordingly is called *autocommands*.

Each event is assigned a number in the → development/vim/sources/src/vim_h/auto_event[`auto_event` enum] (defined in → development/vim/sources/src/vim_h[`vim.h`]).

Each event is also assigned one or more *event names*. For example, the event with the number `EVENT_BUFADD` has two names: `BufAdd` and `BufCreate`.

{ CursorHold #vim-ev-cursor-hold

  After waiting for a character for → development/vim/options/updatetime, a `K_CURSORHOLD` key is put into the inputbuffer which eventually results in`nv_cursorhold()` (in → development/vim/sources/src/normal_c[`normal.c`]) being
  called.

}
{ SessionLoadPost

    When a → development/vim/editing/sessions[session] is loaded.

}
{ VimLeave

  `VimLeave`

}

sa:

  The option → development/vim/options/eventignore can be set to a list of events for which no autocmds should be triggered.

  → development/vim/commands/autocmd[`:autocmd`]
