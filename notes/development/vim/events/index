$ Vim events

Vim has a few events. They can be hooked to execute → development/vim/commands[commands]. This feature accordingly is called *autocommands*.

Each event is assigned a number in the → development/vim/sources/src/vim_h/auto_event[`auto_event` enum] (defined in → development/vim/sources/src/vim_h[`vim.h`]).

Each event is also assigned one or more *event names*. For example, the event with the number `EVENT_BUFADD` has two names: `BufAdd` and `BufCreate`.
