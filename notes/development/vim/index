{ Installing

  { apt

    → https://askubuntu.com/a/601915[This ask Ubuntu answer] recommends to install `vim-gtk3` for everybody that doesn't want to install the Gnome2 libraries on which `vim-gnome` depends and doesn't like
    the 1990 style of `vim-athena`:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt/install vim-gtk3
code }

  }

{ Debug the start up

  Debugging/tracing what happens when vim starts up: `vim -V20debug.txt` will write a file (`debug.txt`).

  → development/vim/commands/scriptnames[`:scriptnames`] lists all scripts that were sourced since vim started up. That might be helpful to determine which vimrc files were used. 


}
{ vimrun.exe

  On Windows, `vimrun.exe` seems to be used to call external commands (`:! move a.txt b.txt`).
  
}
{ TODO

  *vifm* is a file manager with vi key bindings.

  → https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Unused_keys[This page] lists *unused keys* (possibly suitable for key mappings).

 `%` represent the current filename, `##` the argument list. See also → development/vim/script/vimscript/functions/expand[`expand()`]

  { Vim like browser extensions

    Extensions for browser that allows to control the browser similar to Vim include
      • Pentadactyl
      • → https://www.qutebrowser.org/[Qutebrowser] which is its own browser rather than just a plugin.
      • SurfingKeys (Not for VIM users only as it map keystrokes to JavaScript functions. Offers an actual Vim emulator for text field input. I was unable to install SurfingKeys on → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux[WSL] with Debian).
      • Tridactyl (seems to require Firefox, does not run on Chrome?)
      • Vieb
      • Vimium
      • VimiumC
      • Vimvixen
      • Vimperator (which is apparentely essentially dead as Chrome/Firefox abandoned XUL in favor of *Web Standard*).
      • visurf (a frontend for NetSurf)
