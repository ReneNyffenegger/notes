$ vim


Debugging/tracing what happens when vim starts up: `vim -V20debug.txt` will write a file (`debug.txt`).

Displaying chinese characters (on Windows?): `set guifontwide=NSimSun`.

{ Help system

  `:help usr_toc.txt`

}
{ vimrun.exe

  On Windows, `vimrun.exe` seems to be used to call external commands (`:! move a.txt b.txt`).
  
}
