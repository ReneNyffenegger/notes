`autoreconf` is a → development/languages/Perl[perl script] that was generated from → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/autoreconf_in[`autoreconf.in`].

Usually called from → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/autogen_sh or → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/bootstrap_sh.

Apparently, `autoreconf --install` needs either → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure_ac/ or → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure_in/ as input and
runs
  → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/aclocal,
  → development/GNU-Build-System/autoconf and
  → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/autoheader 

? autoreconf automatically runs `autoconf`, `autoheader`, `aclocal`, `automake`, `gettextize` and `libtoolize` in the correct order to save time when changes are made to *autoconf* and *automake*
template files.



sa:
  → https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap[rlwrap] needs autoreconf to be run after downloading.
