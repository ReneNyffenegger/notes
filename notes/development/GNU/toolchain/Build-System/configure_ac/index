$ configure.ac

→ development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/autoscan might help in creating a `configure.ac`.

Based on the content of the `configure.ac` file, → Linux/fhs/usr/share/autoconf creates the → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure[`./configure`] script.

{ Shell script

  `configure.ac` is a shell script with macro instructions.

  So, it would be possible to include common shell script inststructions. However, it is not uncommon to find `configure.ac` files that consist of
  macro instructions only.

}

{ Standard configure.ac layout

Only two macros are required in a `configure.ac` file: `AC_INIT` and `AC_OUTPUT`.

code {
AC_PREREQ(version)
AC_INIT(package, version, bug-report-address)

package info
checks:
  - programs
  - libraries
  - header files
  - types
  - structures
  - compiler characteristics
  - library functions
  - system services

AC_CONFIG_FILES([file …])
AC_OUTPUT
code }

}

{ configure.in

  Earlier versions of → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/Autoconf produced `configure.in`.

  The preferred name is `configure.ac`.

}

  → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure_in
