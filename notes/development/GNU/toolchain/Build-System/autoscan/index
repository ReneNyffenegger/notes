`autoscan` is a perl script that was automatically created from `autoscan.in`.

`autoscan` checks the source code for common portability problems.
It creates → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure_scan[`configure.scan`] which serves as
a starting point to create → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure_ac[`configure.ac`].
