$ GNU Build System

aka *GNU Autotools*.

A *developer* might use the *GNU Autotools* to create a portable source code package that is later used by another user to compile an executable.
-
This other user (the source code compiler) should not be concerned about the autotools at all. Thus, he should not have to invoke `autoconf` etc.

The GNU Build System consists of
  • → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/Autoconf
  • → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/Automake
  • → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/Libtool


The GNU Build System is part of the → development/GNU/toolchain.
