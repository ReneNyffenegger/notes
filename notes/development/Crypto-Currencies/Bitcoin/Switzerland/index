$ Bitcoin in Switzerland

{ Legality

  Using → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin[Bitcoins] as *means of payment* is not regulated, meaning, it does not need a special permit or license.

  However, the professional buying and selling of Bitcoins and the operation of Bitcoin transaction systems *are regulated* by *anti money laundering laws* (AML).
  -
  Such providers, suppliers and vendors must either connect with a self regulating body (Selbstregulierungsorganisation, SRO) or
  apply for a license from FINMA (DUFI = Direkt unterstellter Finanzintermediär)

  If the commercial Bitcoin activities pertain to the money laudering laws, there's an obligation for executive care, especially in identifiying the customers (Know
  your customer, KYC)

  Certain activities even need a *banking license*: for example in fiduciary relationships or other typical bank-type relations.
