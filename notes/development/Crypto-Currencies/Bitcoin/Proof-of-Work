$ Proof of work [Bitcoin]
@ proof of work

A proof of work system is needed to operate a distributed → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/Timestamp-Server[timestamp server].

→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin achieves proof of work with *hash puzzles*: The → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/node that creates
(proposes) a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/block must find a *nonce* such that the *hash* of nonce+previous hash+tx₁+tx₂…+txش is smaller
than a target value.
-
Such puzzles are solved by → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/mining[miners].

By increasing and decreasing the difficulty to solve a specific problem, the proof of work mechanism can compensate
for available (and increasing) CPU power.

An alternative to proof of work is *proof of stake*.
