$ Bitcoin block
@ block

A block is a record in the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain.

A new block is added at to the blockchain at almost a constant rate approximately every 10 minutes.
about-me
A block consists of a *block header* and *transaction data*.
-
A block stores the hash of the previous block's header.

The first → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions[transaction] in a block is special: it starts a new
→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/coin which is owned by the creator of the block.

Explore blocks with → https://blockexplorer.com/[blockexplorer]. For example,
→ blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f[This link] shows the very first block created.

{ Transactions

  Every block stores → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions.

  The first of these transactions is a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions#coinbase-transaction[coinbase transaction] 
}

{ Block header

  The block header stores the *merkle root* of the *merkle tree* of the hashes of the transactions stored in the transaction data section of the block.

}

{ Maximum size of a block

  The size of a block is limited to 1 MB.

{ Block categories

  Three categories of blocks:
    • *Blocks in the main branch* contain → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions thate are considered at least tentatively confirmed
    • *Blocks on side branches off the main branch* have (at least tentatively) lost the race to be in the main branch
    • *Orphan blocks* don't link into the main branch, usually because a missing predecessor

    Blocks in the main branch and on side branches form a tree whose root is the *genesis block*.

    The main branch is the branch with the highest sum of difficulty from genesis block to the respective leave block.

{ Block height #block-height

  The block height is a number that indicates how much blocks there are between the genesis block (block 0) and the block with this number.

  Multiple blocks can have the same block height. This is usually the case when two or more → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/mining[miners] create
  a block roughly simultanously.
  -
  This creates a fork in the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain.

}
{ Genesis block

  The first block, or block 0, is also called the genesis block.
