$ Bitcoin transactions
@ transactions

All transactions are recorded in the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain.

A transaction can not be reversed.

The first transaction in a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/block is special: it starts a new
→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/coin which is owned by the creator of the block.


Every transaction gets inputs, which refer to previous outputs being
spent. Every input has the txid and the signature to prove that it is allowed,
plus an amount and script in every output.


{ Transaction identification

  Transactions are identified by a 64-digit hexadecimal hash called a transaction identifier (txid).
  
  This hash is based on both the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/coin[coins] being spent and on who will be able to spend the results of the transaction.

}

{ Signatures

  Signatures don't describe what the transaction is doing, so they are not part of the transaction.

  They are used to prove that the transaction is authorized by the previous owners of the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/coin[coins]. 

  Although signatures are not part of the transaction, they are part of the transaction hash.

}

{ Misc
