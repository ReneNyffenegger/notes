$ Wallet [Bitcoin]
@ wallet

The wallet does not actually contain → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/coin[coins]. Rather, it
stores the keys that allow you to spend the coins that are associated with a specific → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/address.

The actual value of coins in a wallet is determined by traversing the *entire* → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain and summing up
all credit/debit → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions[transactions] values for the addresses stored in the wallet.

The wallet is not only a collection of keys. It also contains
→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions, accounting information, settings and
information about the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain.

{ Reading/writing wallet.dat

  → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core uses *Berkeley DB* (BDB) to read/write wallet files (`wallet.dat`).
