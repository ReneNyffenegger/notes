$ Wallet [Bitcoin]
@ wallet

The wallet does not actually contain → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/coin[coins]. Rather, it
stores the keys that allow you to spend the coins that are associated with a specific → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/address.

The actual value of coins in a wallet is determined by traversing the *entire* → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain and summing up
all credit/debit → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions[transactions] values for the addresses stored in the wallet.

The wallet is not only a collection of keys. It also contains
→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions, accounting information, settings and
information about the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain.

{ Reading/writing wallet.dat #reading-writing-wallet-dat

  → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core uses → development/databases/Berkeley-DB (BDB) to read/write wallet files (`wallet.dat`).

  Apparently, the entries in the wallet have one of the following types (cf → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/src/wallet/walletdb_cpp, function `ReadKeyValue`):
    • name: an address book name
    • purpose:
    • tx: a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions[transaction]
    • acentry: an accounting entry
    • watchs
    • key: Public key (`class CPubKey`) followed by a private key (`class CPrivKey`)
    • mkey: Master key (`class MasterKey`)
    • ckey: an encrypted key
    • keymeta
    • watchmeta
    • defaultkey: The default receiving → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/address[address'] key
    • pool: a keypool entry
    • version: The version of the software that wrote the wallet
    • cscript: a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/script
    • orderposnext
    • destdagta
    • hdchain
    • bestblock: a pointer to the best → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain seen. The client needs this information for a *rescan* after a restore of a wallet from a backup.
    • wkey: Public key (`class CPubKey`) followed by a wallet key (`class CWalletKey`). Apparently no longer used.
    • setting: used to store userinterface settings. It's no longer used. For backward compatibility, however, there is still one entry so that client with a version less than 0.4.0 can read a wallet.

  See also the function `→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/src/wallet/walletdb_cpp#ReadKeyValue` in
  → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/src/wallet/walletdb_cpp.
