$ node [Bitcoin]
@ node

All nodes store the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain redundantly.

A special type of nodes are → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/mining[miners].

{ Full nodes vs. light weight nodes

  A full node is a program that validates → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/block[blocks] and
  → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions.

rem {
  As a light-weight client, you are not validating signatures, even though they
  are part of the transactions you still have to download them. If you are using
  a full-node that is syncing historical data, you don't actually validate all of
  the signatures in there.
rem }
