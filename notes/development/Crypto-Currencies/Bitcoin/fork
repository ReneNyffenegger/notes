$ Bitcoin: fork
@ fork


{ Soft forks #soft-fork

  Soft forks are necessary when new → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/consensus-rules are added.

  Soft forks were initially managed by Nakomoto.

  { User activated soft forks (UASF)

    In order to activate an UASF, the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients[client] is programmed with
    a *flag day*.
    -
    The new rule will then be activated when this preset time is reached or a specific
    → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/block#block-height[block height] is reached.
    

  }
  { Miner actived soft forks (MASF)

    MASF are dependend on → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/mining[miners] for activation.

  }

}
{ Hard forks #hard-fork

  Hard forks are required to remove → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/consensus-rules.

  Hard forks are rare because they're considered risky: They
   • take much coordination effort and
   • are not backward compatible (it's a protocol upgrade)

  After a hard fork, there will be two → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain[blockchains]: a majority and a minority chain.
  The implaction is: some users will see a different set of → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions than others.

  Hard forks require all full → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/node[nodes] to upgrade or everyone who uses that node may lose money.
