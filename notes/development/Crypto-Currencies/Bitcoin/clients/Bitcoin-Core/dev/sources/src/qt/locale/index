$ src/qt/locale

The Bitcoin-Core project has been designed to support multiple localisations. This directory seems to contain the translations of messages in the GUI.

The files in this directory must not be manually edited. Instead,
→ https://www.transifex.com/bitcoincore/bitcoincoreorg/dashboard/[transifex] should be used.

For each language, there is a `bitcoin_XX.ts` (XML) and `bitcoin_XX.qm` (Binary) file. XX is for example `de` for deutsch/german or `pt_BR` for portuguese in Brazil.
