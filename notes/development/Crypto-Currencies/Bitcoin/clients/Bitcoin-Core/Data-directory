On Linux, the default data directory for → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core is → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bitcoin.

On Windows, its `%APPDATA%\Bitcoin`.

The data directory contains or might contain:
  • `wallet.dat`
  • `peers.dat` (→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/src/addrdb_h)
  • `banlist.dat`
  • `fee_estimates.dat`
  • `mempool.dat`
  • `db.log`
  • `debug.log`


{ Directory blocks

  The blocks directory within the data directory contains:
    • `index`: Subdirectory for some indexes? Apparently, this directory is managed by `CBlockTreeDB`.
    • `blk*.dat` which are *block files*
    • `rev*.dat` which are *undo files*

}
{ Directory chainstate

}

{ Testnet

  If bitcoin-qt is run with `-testnet`, it creates the directory `testnet3` under the data diretory.

  `testnet3` then contains the same files (with different content) as the data directory.

}
