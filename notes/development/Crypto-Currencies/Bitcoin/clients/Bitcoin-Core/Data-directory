On Linux, the default data directory for → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core is → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bitcoin.

On Windows, its `%APPDATA%\Bitcoin`.

The data directory contains or might contain:
  • `bitcoin.conf`
  • `wallet.dat`
  • `peers.dat`: The IP-address database, accessed via `class CAddrDB`, → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/src/addrdb_h
  • `banlist.dat`: The banlist database, accessed via `class CBanDB`,  → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/src/addrdb_h
  • `fee_estimates.dat`
  • `mempool.dat`
  • `db.log`
  • `debug.log`
  • `.lock`


{ Directory blocks

  The `blocks` directory within the data directory contains:
    • `index`: This subdirectory is a levelDB that helps find blocks (`blk*.dat` files?) on the harddisk.. Apparently, this directory is managed by `CBlockTreeDB`.
    • `blk*.dat` which are *block files*. Used for 1) rescanning missing → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions in a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/wallet 2) reorganizing to a different part in the → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/blockchain 3) serving → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/block[block data] to other → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/node[nodes] that are synchronizing
    • `rev*.dat` which are *undo files*

}
{ Directory chainstate

  The `chainstate` directory is a levelDB database.

  It represents all currently unspent → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions along with some information where these
  transactions come from.

  ? Using this database speeds up validation of → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions.
  Without this database, such a validation would also be possible, but the *entire* block-data would have to be scanned for *every* output being spent.


  The data could be rebuilt from the block data which. However, that takes a long time. (See `-reindex` command line flag).

}

{ Testnet

  If bitcoin-qt is run with `-testnet`, it creates the directory `testnet3` under the data diretory.

  `testnet3` then contains the same files (with different content) as the data directory.

}

{ Scrambling data

  Some data (in levelDB?) is scrambled because otherwise some virus scanners would falsly detect them as potential harmful.
