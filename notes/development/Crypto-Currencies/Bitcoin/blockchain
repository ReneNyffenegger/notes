$ Blockchain [Bitcoin]
@ blockchain

The blockchain records all → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions. It is redundantly stored ordered and timestamped on *all*
→ development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/node[nodes].

This architecture is necessary to prevent *double spending* and *modification of old transactions*.

The blockchain's two main ingredients: military grade → development/security/cryptography[encryption] plus distributed system.

The data of the blockchain is stored in → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/block[blocks].
-
A full node only stores a block after it has validated it according to → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/consensus-rules.

Different Nodes that have the same blocks in their respective blockchain are said to be in *consensus*. (This has nothing to to with the
consensus rules!)

{ Reading/writing blockchain indexes

  Apparently, blockchain indexes are written and read with *Level DB*.

}
{ Majority and minority chain

  After a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/fork#hard-fork[hard fork], there will be two blockchains: a majority and a minority chain.

  For example, → development/Crypto-Currencies/Ethereum hard forked into the two blockchain *Ethereum* and *Ethereum classic*.
