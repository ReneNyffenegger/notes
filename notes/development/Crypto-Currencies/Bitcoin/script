@ script

The language is similar to forth and is stack based.

Such scripts are used to determine if a → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/transactions[transaction] is valid.

most transactions share the same script.

The possible opcodes of the language are defined in → development/Crypto-Currencies/Bitcoin/clients/Bitcoin-Core/dev/sources/script/script_h.
