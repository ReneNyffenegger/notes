Ethereum aims at providing a Turing-complete programming language for scripts with which *smart contracts* can be written.
Such a script (or smart contract) is then stored in the blockchain.
-
The script can then be executed in an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM).

{ Solidity

  The high level programming language to write such scripts is called *Solidity*.

}
{ Gas


  When a script is executed, it needs »gas« for each instruction. When the gas is exhausted, the script stops. This makes sure that
  a script does not run indefinitly long.

  Gas is paid for with *Ether*, the currency of Ehtereum.

}
{ GHOST

  GHOST is the protocoll to determine the consensus branch.
