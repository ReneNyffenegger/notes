UML is a descriptive *visual* language: a formalized whiteboard.

UML does not solve problems. It is used to desribe things. Thinking solves problems.

UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram.

UML is an essential tool/artifact of → development/Software-design/methods/RUP.

{ Two diagram categories

  • Structural information
  • Behavioral information

  A subset of behavioral diagrams are the *interaction diagrams*

  { Structural diagrams

    • Class diagram
    • Component diagram
    • Composite structre diagram
    • Deployment diagram
    • Object diagram
    • Package diagram

  }
  { Behaviour diagram

    • Activity diagram
    • State machine diagram
    • Use case diagram

  }
  { Interaction diagrams

    • Communication diagram
    • Interaction overview diagram
    • Sequence diagram
    • Timing diagram
  
  }

}

{ Creating UMLs from declarative text

  → development/UML/tools#umlgraph (→ https://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/umlgraph/[homepage], → https://github.com/dspinellis/UMLGraph[github]) allows the declarative specification and drawing of UML class and sequence diagrams.
