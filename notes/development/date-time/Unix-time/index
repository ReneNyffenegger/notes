Unix time, aka
  • → Linux/POSIX time
  • UNIX Epoch time

Unix time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00, 1 January 1970, → misc/UTC[UTC], without counting the leap seconds.
-
Thus, every day is viewed as having exactly 86400 seconds.
-
Negative values for Unix time are allowed which allows to specify point in time that was before 1970-01-01.

The latest point in time that can be represented with a 32 bit Unix time is 2³¹-1 seconds after 1970-01-01. This gives raise to the → misc/Year-2038-problem[Year 2038 problem].

In → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C, a Unix time is usually stored in a variable whose type is `time_t` (See also → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/date-and-time).

sa:

  The → development/misc/strftime[`strftime`] format specifier for the Unix time is `%c` (which is not availble on Windows).
  -
  Accordingly, the shell command to display the Unix time is: → Linux/shell/commands/date#shell-date-unix-time[`date … +%s`].

  The → development/web/php function → development/web/php/snippets/date-time#php-time[`time()`].

  In quite a few → development/languages[programming languages], a Unix time can be converted to a human readable string with the function → development/misc/strftime[`strftime`].

  → misc/ISO/8601

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/KernelBase_dll/time[`time`] is an → https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/win32/kernelbase/api/index.htm[undocumented function] in 
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/KernelBase_dll[`KernelBase.dll`] that returns the Unix time , that is: the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970.
