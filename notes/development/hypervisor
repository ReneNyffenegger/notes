$ Hypervisor
@ hypervisor

A hypervisor allows a single server to run multiple → hardware/virtual-machine[virtual machines], each with their own operation system, independently from each other.

A virtual machine submits requests for resources to the hypervisor, and the hypervisor coordinates the access to the physical providers of these resources.

Because virtual machines share the same physical server, the efficiency of data centers can be improved by ~reducing~
  • number of servers
  • rack space
  • power consumption
  • cooling
  • interconnect cabling


{ Level 1 and level 2 hypervisors #hypervisor-levels

  A *level 1* hypervisor is loaded before any of the virtual machines and thus act as intermediary between the hardware and VMs.

  A *level 2* hypervisor is an application that runs inside an existing OS.
  -
 Thus, a virtual machine can profit from the OS's drivers and services.

  Examples of level 1 hypervisors include
    • KVM
    • → Windows/optional-features/Hyper-V
    • VMware ESXi
    • Citrix Hypervisor (formlerly: XenServer) 

  Examples of level 2 hypervisors include
    • → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox
    • QEMU
    • VMWare Workstation
    • WMWare Playstaion

  Because Hyper-V is a level 1 hypervisor, it means that → Windows/versions/10, once Hyper-V is enabled, itself *becomes a virtual machine*.
