A hypervisor allows a single server to run multiple *virtual machines*, each with their own operation system, independently from each other.

A virtual machine submits requests for resources to the hypervisor, and the hypervisor coordinates the access to the physical providers of these resources.

Because virtual machines share the same physical server, the efficiency of data centers can be improved by ~reducing~
  • number of servers
  • rack space
  • power consumption
  • cooling
  • interconnect cabling


{ Level 1 and level 2 hypervisors #hypervisor-levels

  A *level 2* hypervisor is an application that runs inside an existing OS.
  -
  A *level 1* hypervisor is the OS itself.

  Examples of level 1 hypervisors include
    • → Windows/optional-features/Hyper-V
    • VMware ESXi

  Examples of level 2 hypervisors include
    • → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox
    • VMWare Workstation
    • WMWare Playstaion

  Because Hyper-V is a level 1 hypervisor, it means that → Windows/versions/10, once Hyper-V is enabled, the OS *itself* becomes a *virtual machine*.
