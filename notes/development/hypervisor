A hypervisor allows a single machine to run multiple operation systems.

{ Level 1 and level 2 hypervisors

  A *level 2* hypervisor is an application that runs inside an existing OS.
  -
  A *level 1* hypervisor is the OS itself.

  Examples of level 1 hypervisors include
    • Hyper-V
    • VMware ESXi

  Examples of level 2 hypervisors include
    • → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox
    • VMWare Workstation
    • WMWare Playstaion

  Because Hyper-V is a level 1 hypervisor, it means that → Windows/versions/10, once Hyper-V is enabled, the OS *itself* becomes a *virtual machine*.
