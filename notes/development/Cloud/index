Cloud computing is evolving as a strategic platform for sraring resources such as
  • Storage
  • Network
  • Software/Services
  • Applications

The *business model* is simple: you pay as you go.

{ Service models #cloud-service-models

  • Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  • Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  • Software as a Service (SaaS)

  IaaS = Networking + Storage + Servers + Virtualization

  Paas = IaaS + O/S + → development/Enterprise/Integration/Middleware[Middleware]

  SaaS = PaaS + Runime + → development/Data + Applications

  Examples:
    • IaaS: DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE)
    • PaaS: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift
    • SaaS: Google Apps, Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting

  Apparently, there is also *BaaS* or *mBaas*: (mobile) Backend as a Service.
