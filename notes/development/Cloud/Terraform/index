Terraform is a software tool that is used to define and provision data center infrastructures using *HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)*, which is a declarative configuration
→ development/languages[language].

Terraform is similar to *CloudFormation*, but deals with not only one provider (such as AWS in the case of CloudFormation).

{ Managing resources

  With HCL, it is possible to manage resources
    • Public and private → development/Cloud[cloud] infrastructures
    • Network appliances
    • → development/Cloud/aaS/SaaS[Software as a Service] (SaaS)
    • → development/Cloud/aaS/PaaS[Platform as a service] (PaaS)

 In order to be able to manage a particular resource, there must be a *provider* for the given type of resource. An exclusive list of such providers is maintained by HashiCorp.

{ Some providers

 Some infrastructure providers include
   • → Microsoft/Azure[Microsoft Azure]
   • Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
   • DigitalOcean
   • → Companies-Products/Google/Cloud-Platform
   • VMware vSphere
   • Amazon Web Services
   • IBM Cloud
   • OpenStack

}
{ Terraform executable

  The → development/Cloud/Terraform/executable can be downloaded from → https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html[Terraform's download page]. It is a
  → development/archive-files/zip[zip file] that contains a single file which is the executable to be stored in a directory that is accessible
  by the `PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable].

}

{ TODO

  How does Terraform compare to → Microsoft/Azure/products/Blueprints?
