 *LZ77* and *LZ78*, aka LZ1 and LZ2 (LZ stands for Lempel and Ziv). Basis for variations such as LZW, LZSS, LZMA etc.

 *LZW* (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) is an improved implementation of LZ7. Simple algorithm. Used for `compress` command.

 *Deflate* (also DEFLATE) uses a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding, specified in RFC 1951.

  ? Is Deflate used in `→ Linux/shell/commands/gzip` and for `.png` images.

  ? Is LZ77 used for `gzip`?

  → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)[Snappy] is based on ideas from LZ77.
