{ Clipboards

  Apparently, UltraEdit features 9 additional clipboards to the standard Windows clipboard. They can be selected with `ctrl-*n*`.
  `ctrl-0` is supposed to choose the standard Windows clipboard - but it doesn't work on my machine. It can be selected
  using menu Edit -> Clipboards, though.
