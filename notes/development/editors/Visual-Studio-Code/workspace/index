$ VS Code: Workspace
@ workspace

A *workspace* can be thought of as a collection of directories (folders) with extra metadata that is created and used by → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code[VS Code]

A workspace allows to set settings, options, extensions, UI state information etc. that apply to this workspace only.

It's possible to edit files without them being associated with a workspace (File -> Open File (?))

See also the menu → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/menu/File/Open-Workspace[File -> Open Workspace]

A workspace can be opened from the command line with `code path/to/workspace`.

{ .vscode directory

  The `.vscode` directory stores *workspace-specific settings* at the root of a project and overrides global user settings.

  This directory stores
  table { ll
    `settings.json` ☰ Project-specific settings
    `tasks.json` ☰ Shared task and build commands (apparently used to customize *Run and Debug*), see → https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    `launch.json` ☰ Debug configuration, see → https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    `extension.json` ☰ Project-specific extensions, see → http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846
  table }

}
{ Single folder workspace

  The settings for a *single folder workspace* are stored in the folder's `.vscode/settings.json` file.

}
{ Mutli-root workspace

  A *mutli-root workspace* is a workspace that manages multiple directories/folders.

  Some (or all?) of the meta data associated with a multi-root workspace is contained in a `wrkspcName.code-workspace` → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON file.

}
{ Transient workspace

  A *transient workspace*
     • will not be opened when VS Code is restarted or reloaded
     • does not show up in the list of recently opened workspaces

  A workspace becomes transient by setting its `transient` property to `true` in the `.code-workspace` file:
code {
{
   "folder"   : [],
   "transient"" true
}
code }

}
