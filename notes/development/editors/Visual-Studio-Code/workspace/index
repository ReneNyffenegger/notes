$ VS Code: Workspace
@ workspace

A *workspace* can be thought of as a collection of directories (folders) with extra metadata that is created and used by → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code[VS Code]

A workspace allows to set settings, options, extensions, UI state information etc. that apply to this workspace only.

It's possible to edit files without them being associated with a workspace (File -> Open File (?))

{ Single folder workspace

  The settings for a *singe folder workspace* are stored in the folder's `.vscode/settings.json` file.

}
{ Mutli-root workspace

  A *mutli-root workspace* is a workspace that manages multiple directories/folders.

  Some (or all?) of the meta data associated with a multi-root workspace is contained in a `wrkspcName.code-workspace` → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON file.
