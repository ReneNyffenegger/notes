$ Visual Studio Code: extensions

{ Showing installed extentions

  On the command line. Using `--show-versions` also shows the version:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-VS-Code/bin/code[code] --list-extensions --show-versions
code }

  In the GUI: `ctrl+shift+p` *or* `F1`, then type `show i[nstalled extensions]`.
  -
  This seems to be equivalent to entering `@installed` in the search field in the *Extensions Activity Bar*.

  Some infomration can also be queried on the command line like so:
code {
→ development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/tools/jq . ~/.vscode/extensions/extensions.json
code }

}
{ Silencing extension recommendations

  It's possible to configure VS Code to not show extension recommendations in → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/settings_json[`settings.json`] by setting
 `extensions.ignoreRecommendations` to `true`.

}
{ Extension management on the command line

  Extensions can be configured with command line options:
table { ll
    `--extension-dir <dir>` ☰ Configure root path for extensions
    `--list-extensions` ☰
    `--show-versions` ☰ Used along with `--list-extensions`
    `--install-extension (<extension-id> | <extension-vsix-path>)` ☰
    `--uninstall-extension (<extension-id> | <extension-vsix-path>)` ☰
    `--enable-proposed-api (<extension-id>)` ☰
table }

  For example, → https://github.com/zokugun/vscode-explicit-folding[explicit folding] and → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/extensions/interesting/VSCodeVim can be installed in one go like so:
code {
code --install-extension zokugun.explicit-folding --install-extension vscodevim.vim
code }

code {
yarn package
code }

code {
code --install-extension vim-<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>.vsix --force
code }

}
