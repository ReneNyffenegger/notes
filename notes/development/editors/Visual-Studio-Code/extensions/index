{ Silencing extension recommendations

  It's possible to configure VS Code to not show extension recommendations in → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/settings_json[`settings.json`] by setting
 `extensions.ignoreRecommendations` to `true`.

sa:
  → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/API is a → development/languages/JavaScript API that can be used from extensions.

  The default location for extensions on → Windows is → Windows/dirs/Users/username/_vscode/extensions[`%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`]
