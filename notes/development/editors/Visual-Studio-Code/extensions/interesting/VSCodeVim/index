  → https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] lists the following steps to build VSCodeVim.

  Prerequisites:
    • → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code (of course…)
    • → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js
    • → https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/[Yarn] (`→ development/languages/JavaScript/npm install --global yarn`)
    • → development/tools/Docker Community Edition (optional)

  Get the sources
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone[git clone] → https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim
cd Vim
code }

  Install the dependencies
code {
yarn install
code }

code {
yarn build-dev # Fast build for development
yarn build     # Slow build for release
yarn watch     # Fast build whenever a file changes
code }

  Testing, with running docker, …
code {
npx gulp test                 # Run tests inside Docker container
npx gulp test --grep <REGEX>  # Run only tests/suites matching <REGEX> inside Docker container
code }
 
  … without docker:
code {
yarn build                    # Build
yarn build-test               # Build tests
yarn test                     # Test (must close all instances of VS Code)
code }

}
