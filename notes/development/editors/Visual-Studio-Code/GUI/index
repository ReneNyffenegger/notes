     • → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Command-Palette which allows to run tasks and commands. (Can be opened with `ctrl+shift+p` or `F1`).
     • *Notifications* to display breif information

  { Notifications

    There are three types of notifications:
      • Information
      • Warning
      • Errors

  }

}

{ Zen mode #vs-code-zen

  In *Zen mode*, VS Code shows only one editor and hides all other GUI elements. This supposedly helps a programmer to focus on editing the code.

  Zen mode is entered with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+k z` and left with double pressing `esc`.

}
{ Misc

  The → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code#vscode-shortcuts[keyboard shortcut] `ctrl+0` moves focus to the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Side-Bar, `ctrl+1` to the *Editor*.
