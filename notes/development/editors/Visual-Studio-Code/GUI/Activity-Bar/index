$ Visual Studio Code: Activity Bar
@ Activity bar

After a fresh installation of → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code, the Activity Bar allows to open
  • Explorer
  • Search Replace (Which seems to be different from a «regular search» which is initiated by `ctrl+f`).
  • Source Control
  • Run & Debug
  • → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/extensions[Extensions]
