$ Visual Studio Code: Help -> Welcome

*Help -> Welcome* opens a page that helps getting started with → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code[VS Code].

? This welcome page is opened by default when VS Code is started, but this behavior can be turned off by ticking off *Show welcome page on startup* or by setting
the value of `workbench.startupEditor` to `none` in the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/settings_json[`settings.json`].
