$ VS Code: Language support

A file is associated with a *language mode* which is identified by a *language ID*.

Files whose language are not recognized are given the language ID *plaintext*, or the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/settings_json[setting] that is configured with `files.defaultLanguage`.

The language mode for the current file can be changed with the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code#vscode-shortcuts[shortcut] `ctrl-k m` or entering
*Change Language Mode* into the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Command-Palette.
-
This command brings up a list of currently installed languages.


{ Associating a file extension with a language ID #vs-code-assoc-ext-with-lang

  A → development/filename-extensions[file extension] can be associated with a language ID in → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/settings_json[`settings.json`]. The following maps the two
  extenions `.wfs` and `.cls` to visual basic (whose language ID is `vb`):
code {
"files.associations" : {
    "*.wsf": "vb"   ,
    "*.cls": "vb"
},
code }


}
{ Language ID of current file #vs-code-lang-id-status-bar

  The language id of the current file is displayed in right side of the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Status-Bar:

{ Definining new languages

  A new language can be defined in an → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/extensions[extension's] → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/extensions/anatomy/package_json[`package.json`] (manifiest) file:
code {
"languages": [{
     "id": "hierlog",
     "extensions": [ ".hlg", ".hierlog" ],
     "aliases": [ "hlg", "hierlog" ]
}]
code }
