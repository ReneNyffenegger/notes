{ Interesting keyboard shortcuts #vscode-shortcuts


  Keyboard shurtcuts can be modified in `keybindings.json`. Some interesting shortcuts include:
  table { ll
    shift+alt + mouse click ☰ Column (box) selection
    ctrl+, ☰ → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/menu/File/Preferences/Settings[File -> Preferences -> Settings]
    ctrl+shift+p *or* F1 ☰ → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Command-Palette
    ctrl+p ☰ Go to (already opened?) files by typing parts of their names
    ctrl+r ☰ Open a recently opened folder or file (Same as File -> Open Recent ?)
    ctrl+b ☰ Show/hide (toggle) sidebar
    ctrl+0 // ctrl+1 resp. ☰ Set focus to → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Side-Bar, to Editor, respectively.
    ctrl+k z ☰ Enter → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI#vs-code-zen[Zen mode]
    ctrl+k m ☰ Set → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/language[language] mode for current file.
    ctrl+space ☰ IntellSense
  table }

  See als the menus
    • → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/menu/File/Preferences/Keyboard-Shortcuts[File -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts] and
    • → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/menu/File/Preferences/Keymaps[File -> Preferences -> Keymaps]


  Some of these keyboard shortcuts don't seem to work together with the VIM plugin.


}
{ User data directory #vscode-user-data-dir

  See also: the → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-VS-Code/bin/code[`code` command line option] `--user-data-dir`.

  { keybindings.json

code {
[
{"key": "ctrl+shift+i", "command": "workbench.action.toggleDevTools" /* Help -> Toggle Developer Tools. Override when clause (isDeveloper) */ }
]
code }

  }

}
{ Encoding

  The default → development/Unicode/character-encoding of VS Code is → development/Unicode/UTF-8 without → development/Unicode/UTF-8#utf-8-bom[BOM].

  The encoding can be changed in VS Code settings (`ctrl+,`) by assigning a value to `"files.encoding"`. Some accepted values include
    • `utf`
    • `utf8bom`
    • `utf16le`
    • `utf16be`
    • `windows1252`

  It is possible to have VS Code auto detect encoding by setting `"files.autoGuessEncoding": true` in → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/settings_json[`settings.json`].

}
{ Misc

 ?  VS Code is built using web technologies on top of *Electron* (which apparently uses Chromium to render the user interface).

}
{ TODO

  { VS Code API

    The *VS Code API* is a JavaScript interface that can be called from an extension.

    The namespaces and functions of this API are found in → https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.d.ts[`vscode.d.ts`].

    { Commands #vs-code-command

      A *command* is a (JavaScript?) function (sometimes referred to as *command handler*) that is identified by a unique identifier.
      
      Commands are added to VS Code with either
        • `….commands.registerCommand()`, or
        • `….commands.registerTextEditorCommand(…)` 

      Then, commands are executed
        • explicitely with `….commands.executeCommand(…)`, or
        • triggered by so called *gestures* (entering commands in the → development/editors/Visual-Studio-Code/GUI/Command-Palette or by a bound key)

  { Extension dependencies on tsc (TypeSript compiler)

    Some extensions seem to be dependent on a TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

   `tsc` can be installed (globally) with
code {
→ development/languages/JavaScript/npm[npm] install -g typescript
code }


  }

}
