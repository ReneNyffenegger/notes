$ Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter stands for Julia, → development/languages/Python and → development/languages/R

{ Installation

  I was able to install Jupyter on → Linux/distributions/Debian 11 like so:

code {
python3 -m → development/languages/Python/standard-library/venv ./py-venv
. ./py-venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter
code }

  After the installation, I started Jupyter like so:

code {
. ./py-venv/bin/activate   # Necessary in a new shell
jupyter notebook
code }

}
{ Editing modes

  Similar to Vim, a Jupyiter Notebook can be edited in two modes
    • *Edit mode*: text is entered into a cell as it is typed (but there are also keyboard shortcuts)
    • *Command mode*: keyboard shortcuts are bound to commands

}
{ Juptyer Notebook Document #jupyter-notebook-document

  A *Jupyter Notebook document* is (typically) a → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON file and has the → development/filename-extensions#ipynb[`.ipynb` extension].
  -
  There is also a Jupitext format which stores the content in Markdown format and makes diffing and merging Jupyter documents easier.

  The document contains:
  table { ll
    Metadata ☰ A data dictionary of definitions to set up and display the notebook)
    Notebook format ☰ Version number of the software
    A list of cells ☰  A call is either Markdown, (executable) Code or the output of the code type cells.
  table }


}
{ Magic functions

 *Magic functions* are directions to IPython. These functions are prefixed by one (applies to the current line only) or two percent signs (applies to the entire cell).
  
  A list of available magic functions can be produced with `%lsmagic`, `%magic` provides more help for the magic functions.
