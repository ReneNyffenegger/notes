COBIT = Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies

COBIT is a framework (or reference model) that provides 37 typical processes for the management of → development/IT. It is especially used for → development/IT/governance.

COBIT divides → development/IT into four domains:
  • Plan and organize
  • Acquire and implement
  • Deliver and support
  • Monitor and evaluate

ISACA views → development/IT/ITIL as a complementary to COBIT.
