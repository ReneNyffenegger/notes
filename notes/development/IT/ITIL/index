ITIL is owned by the *Cabinet Office* (which is part of »her Majesty's« Government).

ITIL was formerly an acronym for *Information Technology Infrastructure Library*.

ITIL focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business.

ITIL underpins → misc/ISO/20000.

ITIL describes
  • processes
  • procedures
  • tasks
  • checklists

The ITIL *framework* is based on a *service lifecycle*.

ISACA views ITIL as a complementary to → development/IT/COBIT

{ Lifecycle stages / Volumes

  ITIL has five volumes which correspond to lifecycle stages:
    • Service Strategy
    • Service Design
    • Service Transition
    • Service Operation
    • Continual Service Improvement (CSI)

  Apparently, other sources name the five stages of the life cycle as follows:
    • Requirements
    • Design
    • Build
    • Deploy
    • Operate
    • Optimize

}
{ TODO

  Capacity management ensures that adequate resources are available to meet the requirements. Capacity management works
  closely with service level management

  ~State of incidents~: can be *closed*, … (apparently also applicable to problems)

  ~Variance~: difference of a planned and actually measured value.
