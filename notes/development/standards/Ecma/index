$ Ecma standards

ECMA was founded 1961-06-17 in Geneva. At that time, ECMA stood for *European Computer Manufacturers Association*.

In 1994, the organization became global and changed their name to *Ecma international - European association for standardizing information and communication systems*. (Note the shift from all-uppercase letters ECMA to only init-cap Ecma).
