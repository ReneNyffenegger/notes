$ Kerberos

Kerberos is an → development/security/authentication system that uses shared secrets and assumes an involed third party to be secure.

The kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server and vice versa across
an insecure network.

Kerberos is defined in → development/web/RFC/index#rfc-4120[RFC 4120]

{ Types of accounts (principals)

  Kerberos defines two types of accounts (→ development/security/principal[principals]):
    • User Principal Name (UPN)
    • Service Principal Name (SPN)

  A SPN can be assigned to users or computers.

}
{ Kerberos' three heads

  The client. Usually the *user*.

  The server. Usually a programm offering a service (such as a → development/databases[database] etc.)
  
  KDC: The key distribution center. This is the trusted 3rd party used to verify the authenticity of both the client and the server.

}
{ KDC - the key distribution center

  The KDC provides two services:
    • AS - → development/security/authentication[Authentication] servcie
    • TGS - Ticket Granting Server

  Apparently, → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/klist_exe[`klist.exe`] is a command that can be used in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`].

  → development/web/RFC#rfc-4559[RFC 4559]: *SPNEGO-based Kerberos and → development/security/authentication/NTLM HTTP Authentication in Microsoft Windows* 
  describes how the Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) and Internet Information Services (IIS) incorporated in Microsoft Windows 2000 use Kerberos for security enhancements of web transactions.
