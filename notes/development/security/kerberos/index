$ Kerberos

The kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server and vice versa across
an insecure network.

Kerberos is defined in → development/web/RFC/index#rfc-4120[RFC 4120]

{ Types of accounts (principals

  Keberos defines two types of accounts (Principals):
    • User Principal Name (UPN)
    • Service Principal Name (SPN)

  A SPN can be assigned to users or computers.

}
{ Kerberos' three heads

  The client. Usually the *user*.

  The server. Usually a programm offering a service (such as a → development/databases[database] etc.)
  
  KDC: The key distribution center. This is the trusted 3rd party used to verify the autenticity of both the client and the server.

}
{ KDC - the key distribution center

  The KDC provides two services:
    • AS - → development/security/authentication[Authentication] servcie
    • TGS - Ticket Granting Server

}
{ cmd.exe

  Apparently, → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/klist_exe[`klist.exe`] is a command that can be used in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`].

}
