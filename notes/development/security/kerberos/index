The kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server and vice versa across
an insecure network.

Kerberos is defined in → development/web/RFC/index#rfc-4120.

{ Kerberos' three heads

  The client. Usually the *user*.

  The server. Usually a programm offering a service (such as a database etc.)
  
  KDC: The key distribution center. This is the trusted 3rd party used to verify the autenticity of both the client and the server.

}
{ KDC - the key distribution center

  The KDC provides two services:
    • AS - Authentication servcie
    • TGS - Ticket Granting Server

}
{ cmd.exe

  Apparently, `klist` is a command that can be used in → Windows/cmd-exe.
