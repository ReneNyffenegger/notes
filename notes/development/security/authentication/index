Authentication confirms the identity of a user or a service.

It often comes along with *authorisation* which checks and confirms the user's access rights.

Authentication is performed by using → development/security/cryptography[cryptographic] operations such as *encryption* or *signatures*.

Authentication includes methods in which users are identified by something the user *knows* (usually a → development/security/password) or something a user *has*
(like public key certificates or biometric features).

  An entity than can be authenticated is a → development/security/principal.
