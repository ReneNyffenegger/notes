Authentication confirms the identity of a user or a service.

It often comes along with *authorisation* which checks and confirms the user's access rights.

There are three fundemental authentication procedures
table { ll
  With something you know ☰ i.e. a → development/security/password, typically performed by using → development/security/cryptography[cryptographic] operations such as *encryption* or → development/security/cryptography/Digital-signature[digital signatures].
  With something you possess ☰ such as a  device etc
  With something attatched to your body ☰ fingerprints etc. (Biometric authentication)
table }

Advantages of *biometric authetication include
  • Not easily lost or stolen
  • Cannot be shared
  • Cannot be forgotten
