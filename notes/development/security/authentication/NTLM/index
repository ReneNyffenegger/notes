NTLM stands for *NT LAN Manager*.

{ Authentication process

  NTLM uses a *challenge-response* protocol:
    • The client sends the username to the server
    • The server sends back a random number (i. e. the challenge)
    • The client encrypts this number with the hash value of his password and sends this value back to the server
    • The server (which has the user's password stored in a database) also encrypts the challenge with the user's password's hash value and compares the response sent back by the client

  Thus, the password is not transmitted over the network.
