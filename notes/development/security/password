A password that is often used should be *easyly typable*, especially if entered on mobile devices.

Unencrypted passwords are often found on (badly secured) network drives. Apparently, users love to store their passwords in
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel], → Microsoft/Office/Word[Word], text etc. files.
-
Thus, a first approach when trying to find passwords is using tools like → Linux/shell/commands/grep[`grep`],
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[`findstr.exe`] etc.

{ TODO

  Crack passwords with → development/security[John the Ripper]. Compare with RainbowCrack.

sa:
  → Linux/security/password

  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-NT/CurrentVersion/Winlogon#reg-enable-automatic-logon[Enable automatic logon] in the → Windows/registry[registry].
