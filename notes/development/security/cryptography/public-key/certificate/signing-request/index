$ Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

A *Ceritificate Signing Request (CSR)* is used in a → development/security/cryptography/public-key/infrastructure by an applicant to apply for a *digital identity certificate*.

A CSR usually consists of
  • (Digitally signed) identifying information (such as the domain name)
  • The public key of the key pair with whose private key the identifiying information was signed.

{ Domain Validation (DV)

  RFC 8555 outlines the steps to obtain a *Domain Validation (DV) certificate* like so:
  -
  1) Generate a PKCS#10 [RFC2986] Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
  -
  2) Cut and paste the CSR into a CA’s web page.
  -
  3) Prove ownership of the domain(s) in the CSR by one of the following methods:
     • Put a CA-provided challenge at a specific place on the web server.
     • Put a CA-provided challenge in a DNS record corresponding to the target domain.
     • Receive a CA-provided challenge at (hopefully) an administrator-controlled email address corresponding to the domain, and then respond to it on the CA’s web page.
  -
  4) Download the issued certificate and install it on the user’s Web Server.

{ Format

  Formats for a CSR include
    • → development/security/cryptography/public-key/cryptography#pkcs[PKCS#10]
    • Signed Public Key and Challenge (SPKAC) which is generated by some → development/web/browser[web browsers]

  { Base64 representation / PKCS#10

    The base 64 representation of the PKCS#10 standard for a CSR looks like the following snippet:
code {
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
MIICoTCCAYkCAQAwXDELMAkGA1UEBhMCY2gxDzANBgNVBAgMBnp1cmljaDEQMA4G
…
XcQTXKnAcP86M1tKMwlzokZlgA1K1qrVZuuHF1zVN2S8zQXCnXn5kc2BOBx03e0r
aiCCNcc=
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
code }

  }
    
}

  Section 3.1 of RFC 1424 describes a *certification request syntax for Privacy-Enhanced Mail*, which is incompatible with the CSR described ub RFC 2986.
