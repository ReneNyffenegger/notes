  *pbkdf2* stands for *password based key derived function 2*.

code {
$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out file.txt.encrypted -pass pass:9jd0kdfj0zkj4f
*** WARNING : deprecated key derivation used.
Using -iter or -pbkdf2 would be better.

sa:

 `openssl enc -ciphername` is similar to `openssl ciphername`. The first form does not work with engine-provided ciphers, because this form is processed before the configuration file is read and any ENGINEs loaded.
