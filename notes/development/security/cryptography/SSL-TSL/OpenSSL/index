OpenSSL is the world’s most widely used implementation of the → development/security/cryptography/SSL-TSL[Transport Layer Security (TLS)] protocol.

{ Alogrithms

  OpenSSL supports the following algorithms:
    • RSA
    • DSA (obsolete)
    • ECDSA
    • EdDSA (not widely supported)

}
{ libcrypto

 `libcrypto` is a (or *the*?) OpenSSL crypto library.

  This library implements a wide range of cryptographic algorithms which are used in various Internet standards.

}
{ openssl
 
  { Determine version

code {
openssl version
code }

  Using `-a` prints the complete version information, including the *OPENSSLDIR* directory (for example `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib[/usr/lib]/ssl`) which is where
  OpenSSL looks for default configurations and root certificates.
code {
openssl version -a
code }

  }
  { Get help

    Get a list of standard, digest and cipher commands:
code {
openssl help
code }

  }
  { Create a private key

code {
openssl genpkey -out fd.key -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -aes-128-cbc
code }

     `openssl genrsa` is a legacy command which should not be used anymore

  }
  { Get a file's SHA1 digest

code {
openssl sha1 file.txt
code }

  }
  { Show a remote host's server SSL certficate

code {
openssl s_client -connect 'somehost.xy:443' -showcerts
code }

  }

}
