$ glossary [cryptography]

~certification authority~ is a trusted third party that certifies public keys.

~digital signature~: used to prove the integrity of a message. To create a digital signature, a private key is needed. With the public key (and the right algorithm), the
integrity can then be checked. RSA is the most common used digital signature algorithm.

~hash function~: A good cryptographic hash algorithm converts arbitrary data into a seemingly-random number.

~private key~: A secret (randomly generated) number that *should* only be known to the person who generated it. It's used to create a digital signature and encrypt messages.

~public key~: A number that can be calculated from a private key. It needs not be kept private. The private key cannot be calculated from the public key.

~salt~: a random string that is either added to the data to be encrypted or the password in order to make *dictionary attacks*
more difficult.
