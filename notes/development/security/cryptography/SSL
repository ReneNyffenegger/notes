{ SSL certificate

  Three types of certficates:
    • Domain validated (aka low assurance certificate)
    • Organization validated (aka high assurance certificate)
    • Extended validation (EV)

? An SSL certificate is basically a text file with a *digital signature*: an authority signs the certficate with the authorities private key.

  The SSL certificate contains
    • A domain, server or hostname
    • A name and a location

? The certificate comes with a public/private key pair. This pair is used in the *handshake* phase: the client encrypts a symmetric key with the certificates public key.

? An SSL certificate is trusted because it is either in a list of implicitely trusted certficates or it is trusted by one of the controllers of that list.

  File suffixes for certificates seem to be:
     • `*.pem`
     • `*.crt`
     • `*.ca-bundle`
     • `*.cer`
     • `*.p7b`
     • `*.p7s`
     • `*.pfx`

{ Relationship to SSH #ssl-vs-ssh

  Note: don't confuse SSL with → development/security/SSH[SSH]. Both allow to create a *tunnel* to exchange data in encrypted form with checked intergrity.
  
  But SSL uses → development/security/cryptography/X_509 certificates while SSH uses their own format.
