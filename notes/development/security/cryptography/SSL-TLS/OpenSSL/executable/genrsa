$ openssl genrsa
@ genrsa

`openssl genrsa` generates an RSA private key

Apparently, `genrsa` should be considered a lecacy command which should not be used anymore.

code {
$ openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem
code }

sa:
  Compare with `â†’ development/security/cryptography/SSL-TLS/OpenSSL/executable/genpkey` and `gendsa`.
