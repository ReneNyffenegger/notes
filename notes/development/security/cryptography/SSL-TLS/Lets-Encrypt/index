$ Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt is a Certification Authority (CA) which issues certificates that are required to enable → development/web/HTTPS for a website/→ web/webserver. Let's Encrypt will issue such a certificate to everyone who demonstrates to have control over the server where the webserver runs.

Let’s Encrypt is a joint project of EFF, Mozilla and many other sponsors.

{ Certbot #certbot

  Certbot is the ACME client (see → development/web/RFC#rfc-8555[RFC 8555]) recommended by Let's Encrypt (a list of other client implementations
  is → https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/[here]).

  Certbot fetches a certificate from Let's Encrypt. Generated keys and fetched certficates are stored under `/etc/letsencrypt/live/$domain` (`$domain` = certificate name),hw

  Certbot is meant to be run on the machine where the webserver is hosted.
  -
  If Certbot is run with root privileges, it is able to automatically configure TLS/SSL for Apache and nginx.

  Most modern Linux distributions (basically any that use systemd) can install Certbot packaged as a snap.

  Some commands:
    • `certbot` (or `certbot run`): Obtain and install a certificate.
    • `certbot certonly`: Obtain a certificate without installing it.
    • `certbot --nginx`: Use nginx plugin?
    • `certbot certificates`: Show a list of all certificates that cerbot knows about.
    • `certbot --version` (useful when asking questions in the community forum)

  Log file: `/var/log/letsencrypt`.
