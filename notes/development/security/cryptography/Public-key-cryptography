Any cryptographic system that uses the public key and private key pair is said to be *public key cryptography* or *asymmetric cryptography*.

The best-known uses for public key cryptography are:
 • authentication (Profing that holder of private key sent a message)
 • encryption (Only the holder of the private key can decrypt a message encrypted with a public key.
