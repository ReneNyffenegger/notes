Any → development/security/cryptography[cryptographic] system that uses the public key and private key pair is said to be *public key cryptography* or *asymmetric cryptography*.

The best-known uses for public key cryptography are:
 • authentication (Profing that holder of private key sent a message)
 • encryption (Only the holder of the private key can decrypt a message encrypted with a public key.

RSA is one of the dominant public key cryptosystems.

{ Possible notation

  `A` is → development/security/cryptography/persons/Alice-and-Bob[Alice's] public key, and `a` is her private key. Thus,
   -
  `{msg}ᴬ` is an encrypted cyphertext,
  -
  `{msg}ᵃ` is a signed message.

  Alice sends Bob a signed and encrypted message `{{msg}↑a↑}↑B↑}`.
  -
  Using his private key, Bob gets `{msg}↑a↑`.
  -
  Using Charlies public key, Bob encrypts this to `{{msg}↑a↑}↑C↑` and sends it to Charlie.
  -
  Using his private key, Charlie decrpyts it to `{msg}↑a↑` and then uses Alice's public key to
  (naively) verify that Alice sent `{msg}`.
  -
  Thus, Charlie is under the wrong impression that Alice sent `{msg}` to Charlie rather than to Bob.
