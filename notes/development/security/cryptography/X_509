$ X.509

X.509 is a standard that defines the format of → development/security/cryptography/Public-key-certificate[public key certificates].
The standard is based on ASN.1.

An X.509 certificate consists of a public key and an identity such as a hostname, an organization or an individual. This data is signed by
a certificate authority (CA) or is self-signed.

X.509 certificates are used, for example, in → development/security/cryptography/SSL-TSL

X.509 can be contrasted to the PGP's *web of trust*. The former uses a hierarchical approach based on a certificate authority.

sa:
  → development/security/credential[Security: credentials]

  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/bin/version/makecert_exe[`makecert.exe`] creates X.509 certificates

  A typical → development/filename-extensions[file extension] for → development/Base64 decoded certificates is `.cer`.
