$ ssh-keyscan

`ssh-keyscan` gathers public keys from servers.
-
This command was designed to aid in building → development/security/SSH/known-hosts[known host files].

No login access is required on the servers that the tool is scanning. The tool does not employ encryption either (and is therefore subject to man-in-the-middle attacks).

{ Examples etc.

  Get the public rsa key from server *srv.xy*, using port 2121 (without `-p`, the default port 22 would be used):
code {
$ ssh-keyscan -p 2121 -t rsa srv.xy
code }

  The output of `ssh-keyscan` can be piped into `→ development/security/SSH/commands/keygen`:
code {
$ ssh-keyscan -p 2121 -t rsa srv.xy | ssh-keygen -lv -f -
code }


}
