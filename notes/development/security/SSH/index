  table { ll

  `-4`, `-6` ☰ IPv4, IPv6 addresses only
  `-A` ☰ Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent such as `ssh-agent`, use with caution.
  `-a` ☰  Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection
  `-C` ☰ Request → development/compression of → development/Data (same algorithm as also `→ Linux/shell/commands/gzip` ueses)
  `-f` ☰ Go to background just before command execution. Useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like `ssh -f host xterm`. `-f` implies `-n`.
  `-G` ☰ Print its configuration
  `-g` ☰ Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
  `-K` ☰ Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.
  `-k` ☰
  `-M` ☰ Places the ssh client into “master” mode for connection sharing.
  `-N` ☰ Do not execute a remote command, useful for just forwarding ports.
  `-n` ☰ Redirects stdin from `→ Linux/fhs/dev/null` (preventing reading from stdin). `-n` must be used when ssh is run in the background.  A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote machine: `ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs &` will start an emacs on `shadows.cs.hut.f`i, and the X11 connection will be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel. The ssh program will be put in the background. (This does not work if ssh needs to ask for a password or passphrase; see also the `-f` option.)
  `-q` ☰ Quiet mode, compare with `-v`
  `-s` ☰
  `-T` ☰ Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.
  `-t` ☰ Force pseudo-terminal allocation.
  `-V` ☰ Display Version
  `-v` ☰ Verbose mode, compare with `-q`
  `-X` ☰ Enables X11 forwarding.
  `-x` ☰ Disables X11 forwarding
  `-Y` ☰ Enables trusted X11 forwarding.
  `-y` ☰ Send log information using syslog rather than writing it to stderr. Compare with `-E`
  `-B bind_interface` ☰
  `-b bind_address` ☰ 
  `-c cipher_spec` ☰ 
  `-D [bind_address:]port` ☰
  `-E log_file` ☰ 
  `-e escape_char` ☰  Specifies the escape character for sessions with a pty, default is `~`.
  `-F configfile` ☰ 
  `-I pkcs11` ☰ Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user authentication.
  `-i identity_file` ☰  Speficies itentity file having the private key used for authentication. Default is `~/.ssh/id_*`.
  `-J [user@]host[:port]` ☰
  `-L address` ☰ → #ssh-tunneling[Tunneling]: forward connectons to local port to a remote port/socket.
  `-l login_name` ☰ 
  `-m mac_spec` ☰ 
  `-O ctl_cmd` ☰ 
  `-o option` ☰ 
  `-p port` ☰
  `-Q query_option` ☰ 
  `-R address` ☰ 
  `-S ctl_path` ☰ 
  `-W host:port` ☰ Requests that standard input and output on the client be forwarded to host on port over the secure channel. Implies `-N`,` -T`, `ExitOnForwardFailure` and `ClearAllForwardings` (overwritable in configuration file or using `-o`)
  `-w local_tun:remote_tun` ☰
