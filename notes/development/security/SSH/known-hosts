$ SSH known hosts

*Known hosts* files are stored globally in `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` and per user in `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_ssh/known_hosts`.

{ Format

 `sshd(8)` documents the known hosts file format.

  { Un-hashed format

    Each line contains the following fields which are  separated by spaces
    table { ll
      hostnames ☰
      bits ☰
      exponent ☰
      modulus ☰
      comment ☰ optional, not used
    table }

    *Hostnames* is a comma-separated list of patterns (`*` and `?` being wildcards). Each pattern in turn is matched against the canonical host name (when authenticating a client) or against the user-supplied name (when authenticating a server). A pattern may also be preceded by `!` to indicate negation: if the host name matches a negated pattern, it is not accepted (by that line) even if it matched another pattern on the line. A hostname or address may optionally be enclosed within `[ … ]` brackets then followed by `:` and a non-standard port number.

    *Bits*, *exponent* and *modulus* are taken directly from the RSA host key; they can be obtained, for example, from `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub`.

  { Hashed format #ssh-known-hosts-hashed

    The information might also be stored in a (SHA-1?) hashed format.
    -
    This format is indicated if a line starts with `|` (or `|1|` ?)

    Because the format is hashed, the hostnames cannot be extracted from a hashed format.
    -
    However, it is possible to query the existence of a given hostname:
code {
$ → development/security/SSH/commands/keygen -H -F inexisting-host
$ → development/security/SSH/commands/keygen -H -F existing-host
# Host existing-host found: line 4
|1|…
code }

  }

}

sa:
  `→ development/security/SSH/commands/keyscan` is a utility that was designed to aid building and verifying known host files.
