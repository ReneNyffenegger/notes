  { Security token

    A *security token* is a set of information that facilitates the sharing of identity and security informatin in heterogeneous environments or across security domains.

    Sometimes, a security token is also referred to as *assertion* (for example in RFC 7521)

    Examples of security tokens include
      • JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
      • Security Assertion markup Language (SAML)

  { Hardware Security Module (HSM)

    A HSM is a (generally very expensive) product which is specifically designed to make key extraction impossible, *even* with physical access to the server.

    A HSMs not only generates and stores keys, but also performs all necessary operations such as signature generation.
