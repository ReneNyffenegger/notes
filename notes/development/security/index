  { Security token

    A *security token* is a set of information that facilitates the sharing of identity and security informatin in heterogeneous environments or across security domains.

    Sometimes, a security token is also referred to as *assertion* (for example in RFC 7521)

    Examples of security tokens include
      • JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
      • Security Assertion markup Language (SAML)

  }
  { Hardware Security Module (HSM)

    A HSM is a (generally very expensive) product which is specifically designed to make key extraction impossible, *even* with physical access to the server.

    A HSMs not only generates and stores keys, but also performs all necessary operations such as signature generation.

  { FIDO - Fast IDentity Online

    The stated mission of the → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance[FIDO Alliance] is to
   *develop and promote authentication standards that «help reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords»*.

?   The primary result of the FIDO2 project (a joint effort between the FIDO alliance and W3C) are WebAuthn and CTAP.


    Authentication technologies supported by FIDO include
      • Biometrics (fingerprints, iris scanners, voice and face recognition etc.)
      • Trusted platform modules (TSP)
      • USB security tokens
      • Embedded Secure Elements (eSE)
      • Smart cards
      • Near-field communication (NFC)

  }
  { CTAP - Client to Authenticator Protocol

    CTAP (or X.1278) is complementary to the *Web Authentication* (WebAuthn)
    standard and enables a roaming, user-controlled cryptographic authenticator
    (such as a smartphone or a hardware security key) to interoperate with a
    client platform such as a laptop.
