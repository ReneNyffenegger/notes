`strftime` is similar to → development/languages/printf[`printf`], but the format specifiers it processes are designed for date and time components,
especially those that are found in the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/structs/tm[`tm` struct].

{ Interesting format specifiers

  Some, imho, interesting `strftime` format specifiers are;

  table { lll

 ~Format specifier~ ☰ ~Possible result~ ☰ ~Comment~
  `%T` ☰ `12:16:18` ☰ → misc/ISO/8601[ISO 8601] shorthand for HH:MM:SS, equivalent to `%H:%M:%S`
  `%F` ☰ `2019-09-22` ☰ Equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d`
  `%y` ☰  `19` ☰ Year with 2 digits
  `%Y` ☰  `2019` ☰ Year with 4 digits
  `%c` ☰  `Sun Sep 22 12:16:18 2019` ☰

  table }
