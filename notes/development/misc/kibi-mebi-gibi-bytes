$ kibibytes, mebibytes and gibibytes

Just as *kilo* stands for 1024, *kibi* stands for 1024. The same reasoning goes for *mebi* and *gibi*.

1 kibibyte = 1 KiB = 1024 bytes

1 mebibyte = 1 MiB = 1024 kibibytes = 1'048'576 bytes

1 gibibyte = 1 GiB = 1024 mebibytes = 1'073'741'824 bytes

This wonderful quote was found in `man resize2fs`: 
  "
    Note: when kilobytes is used […], I mean real, power-of-2 kilobytes, (i.e.,
    1024 bytes), which some politically correct folks insist should be the
    stupid-sounding «kibibytes». The same holds true for megabytes, also
    sometimes known as «mebibytes», or gigabytes, as the amazingly silly
    «gibibytes». Makes you want to gibber, doesn't it?
