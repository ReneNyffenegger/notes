$ kibibytes, mebibytes and gibibytes

1 kibibyte = 1 KiB = 1024 bytes

1 mebibyte = 1 MiB = 1024 kibibytes = 1'048'576 bytes

1 gibibyte = 1 GiB = 1024 mebibytes = 1'073'741'824 bytes

This wonderful quote was found in `man resize2fs`: *Note: when kilobytes is used […], I mean real, power-of-2 kilobytes, (i.e., 1024 bytes), which some politically correct folks insist should be the stupid-sounding «kibibytes».  The same holds true for megabytes, also sometimes known as «mebibytes», or gigabytes, as the amazingly silly «gibibytes». Makes you want to gibber, doesn't it?*
