A pseudo terminal consists of two virtual character devices: a master (PTM) and a slave (PTS).

Usually, the master is connected to a terminal emulator (such as → Linux/X/xterm) and the slave 
is connected to a program being run, most commonly a → Linux/shell (such as → Linux/shell/bash).
Thus, the slave behaves exactly like a classical terminal.


{ Asynchronous bidirectional communiction

  Data travels anynchronously in both directions between the master and the server.

{ Unix 98 vs BSD

  There are two APIs: BSD style and Unix 98 (System V) style.

  BSD style pseudo terminals are deprecated on Linux since kernel version 2.6.4

  { Unix 98 style
 
    Master pseudo terminals: → Linux/fhs/dev/ptmx

    Slave pseudo terminals: → Linux/fhs/dev/pts


  }
  {  BSD style

     Master: `/dev/ptyXY`

     Slave: `/dev/ttyXY`

  }

}
{ Examples of usage

  Pseudo terminals are used, among others, by *network login services* (ssh, rlogin, telnet) and to implment *terminal emulators* (such as xterm, script, screen, tmux, unbuffer, expect).

  They are also be used to send data to `su` or `passwd` (they refuse to read from pipes).
