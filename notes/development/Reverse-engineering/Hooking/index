$ Reverse engineering: Hooking

Hooking: Intercept function/API calls, messages or events between programs or program parts.

Steps:
   • Determine the location (address) of the function to be hooked.
   • Change page protection (because machine language instructions need to be changed)
   • Modify function so that it jumps to own code (the »trampoline«).
