The goal of OpenDTrace is to capture information at *runtime, without having to stop* the investigated program or kernel.

Providers
  • System calls (`syscall`)
  • Function boundary tracing (`fbt`)
  • Timing services (`profile`)
  • Network (`ip`, `tcp`)
  • Filesystem (`vfs`)
  • Process scheduler (`proc`)
