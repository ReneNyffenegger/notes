$ OpenDTrace - Windows

{ The program to be traced

  This is the source code for the program to be traced. As always, when experimenting with something new, I try to
  make the example as short as possibly: only two functions are called: `MessageBoxA` and `ExitProcess`.

  The program does not need the C library, therefore I link it with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/options/nodefaultlib[`/NODEFAULTLIB`] and have to
  specify the → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE/entry-point with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/options/entry[`/ENTRY`].

{ The script

  The following script catches the call to `MessageBox` and prints the addresses of the two string parameters (`arg1` and `arg2`).

  Unfortunately, I was unable to use `copyinstr()` to `printf` the string that was passed to the `MessageBox`. 

}
{  Running the script

code {
dtrace -c MessageBox.exe -s trace.d
code }

  The script's output shows that it correctly determines the values of the addresses that are passed to `MessageBox`:
