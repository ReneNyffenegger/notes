Extracts from → development/languages/Python/PEP[PEP] 783:
  • Android is broadly a POSIX platform, based on a Linux kernel
  • It uses the → Linux/ELF binary format.
  • Instead of libc, it provides its own C library implementation called *Bionic*. As a result, it is generally not binary-compatible with any other Linux distribution, even if the architecture matches.
  • It also has its own filesystem layout which doesn’t resemble any other Unix (like the → Linux/fhs[FHS])
  • Despite all these differences, C code that compiles for Linux usually also compiles for Android (unless it involves direct access to hardware devices or operating system services).jw
