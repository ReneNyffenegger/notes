$ Character encoding
@ character encoding

A character encoding specifies how a sequence of → development/Unicode characters is converted to bytes (while decoding transforms such bytes back to respective Unicode characters again).

? In → Windows, a character encoding is identified by a → Windows/development/code-page.

→ development/Unicode and → misc/ISO/10646 define a few encodings for the UCS (Universal Character Set):
  • → development/Unicode/UTF-8
  • UTF-16
  • UTF-32
  • UCS-2
  • UCS-4

{ Determining the character encoding of a file or a byte stream

  → https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/[uchardet] (by freedesktop.org) takes a sequence of bytes in an unknown character encoding and attempts to determine the encoding of the text. The returned encoding names are
  → Linux/shell/commands/iconv[iconv]-compatible.

  In a → Linux/shell[Unix shell], the character encoding of a file might be determined with `→ Linux/shell/commands/file` or `→ Linux/shell/commands/file -i`.

  With → development/languages/Python, the encoding of a bytestream can be determined with → development/languages/Python/libraries/beautifulsoup/UnicodeDammit[`bs4.UnicodeDammit`].

}

sa:

  → Linux/shell/commands/iconv[`iconv`] can be used to convert text from one character encoding to another.

  In → Microsoft/dot-net, a character encoding is represented by the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Text/Encoding[`System.Text.Encoding` class].

  An example that creates files in different encodings is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/StreamWriter#dotNet-StreamWriter-encodings[here].
