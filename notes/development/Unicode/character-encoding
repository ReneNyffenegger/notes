$ Character encoding
@ character encoding

A character encoding specifies how a sequence of → development/Unicode characters is converted to bytes (while decoding transforms such bytes back to respective Unicode characters again).

? In → Windows, a character encoding is identified by a → Windows/development/code-page.


→ development/Unicode and → misc/ISO/10646 define a few encodings for the UCS (Universal Character Set):
  • → development/Unicode/UTF-8
  • UTF-16
  • UTF-32
  • UCS-2
  • UCS-4

{ Determining the character encoding of a file

  In a → Linux/shell[Unix shell], the character encoding of a file might be determined with `→ Linux/shell/commands/file` or `→ Linux/shell/commands/file -i`.

}

sa:

→ Linux/shell/commands/iconv[`iconv`] can be used to convert text from one character encoding to another.

→ development/web/HTML/characterset

→ development/Unicode/character-encoding-known

  The → development/languages/R/packages/DBI/dbConnect/encoding[`encoding` parameter of `dbConnect`]

  In → Microsoft/dot-net, a character encoding is represented by the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Text/Encoding[`System.Text.Encoding` class].
  -
  An example that creates files in different encodings is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/StreamWriter#dotNet-StreamWriter-encodings[here].

  Using the → Microsoft/dot-net methods → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/File/ReadAllText[`System.IO.File::ReadAllText`]  and `WriteAllText` to
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/File/ReadAllText#ReadAllText-change-encoding[change a file's encoding].
