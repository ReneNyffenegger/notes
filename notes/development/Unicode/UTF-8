$ UTF-8

UTF-8 is an → development/Unicode/character-encoding[unicode encoding] that uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent a → development/Unicode/character.

{ Essential characteristics of UTF-8

  One of the main characteristics of UTF-8 is that preserves the full range of the US-→ development/Unicode/ASCII characters. Thus, when UTF-8 was introduced, it was already
  compatible with software and → development/Data that processed ASCII characters exclusively. (See also → misc/ISO/10646#adoption-iso-10646).

  UTF-8 encodes uses a varying number of bytes to encode the individual Universal Character Set (UCS).

  The byte-values `C0`, `C1`, `F5` and `FF` occur never in UTF-8 encoded text.

  The boundaries between characters are easily found from any byte in a UTF-8 stream.

  Boyer-Moore fast search algorithm can be applied.

{ BOM (Byte Order Mark) #utf-8-bom

  The → development/Unicode/BOM[BOM] for UTF-8 is `ef` `bb` `bf`, however, the → development/Unicode[Unicode] standard does not recommend it.

  Even though the BOM is not recommend for UTF-8, → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] scripts check for such a BOM and especially in conjunction with → Windows/development/COM, it
  is often very benefical to use the BOM.
