abbr: Byte Order Mark

BOM sounds like a *bomb* and tend to *boom*.

The BOM for → development/endianness[big endian] UTF-16 is → development/Unicode/Codepoints/spacy-codepoints[U+FEFF (ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK SPACE)].
-
UTF-16 little endian: `fe` `ff`
-
→ development/Unicode/UTF-8[UTF-8]: `ef` `bb` `bf`


{ Problems

  A particular problem with BOMs is that when files (and sometimes even strings) are (quickly) concatenated, the BOM occurs in the middle of the resulting file.

  Empty files (without text) are no longer empty (zero bytes).

  Files that contain only the → development/Unicode/ASCII[ASCII] subset of UTF-8, don't have only ASCII characters anymore (the BOM is not ASCII). This might cause
  some tools to break

  *She-bangs* (`#!/bin/sh`) not possible anymore.

  → development/languages/VBScript[VBScript] script files with BOM don't seem to run anymore.

  BOM is illegal in → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON[JSON].
