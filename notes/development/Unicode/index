Unicode is a → development/Unicode/character-set that (hopefully) contains every → development/Unicode/character someone can possibly think of.
Thus, its goal is to UNIfy all enCODEings (=UNICODE) of the world.

Unicode addresses many things, such as sequences of characters are displayed.

With Unicode, there is not a one to one relation ship anymore between characters and bytes.


{ Extended Grapheme Clusters (Logical Characters)

 Unicode considers a character with a thingy (circles, graves etc, such as *é*) to consist of two characters: the base character (*e*) and the thingy.

}
{ Cases

   Three cases: Upper-, lower and titlecase.

   Changing the case in a string might change the string's length.

   Σ is the uppercase version of both σ and ς.

   ª has not uppercase version.

   ᵃ and ᴬ are letters and are lowercase, but they are not lowercase letters.

   The case might be → development/locale[locale] dependent.

}
