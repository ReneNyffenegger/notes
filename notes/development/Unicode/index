Unicode is a → development/Unicode/character-set that (hopefully) contains every → development/Unicode/character someone can possibly think of.
Thus, its goal is to UNIfy all enCODEings (=UNICODE) of the world.

Unicode addresses many things, such as sequences of characters are displayed.

With Unicode, there is not a one to one relation ship anymore between characters and bytes.


{ Extended Grapheme Clusters (Logical Characters)

 Unicode considers a character with a thingy (circles, graves etc, such as *é*) to consist of two characters: the base character (*e*) and the thingy.
