$ Collation
@ collation

A collation is a set of rules that specifies how text is compared (and by implication sorted) in a → development/Unicode/character-set, and by extension, how text is sorted.
-
The collation is used, for example, in a → development/databases/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`] clause of → development/databases/SQL[SQL]

Apparently, in Sweden, `z` is ordered before `ö` while in Germany, the `ö` is ordered before the `z`.
