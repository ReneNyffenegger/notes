$ Collation
@ collation

A collation is a set of rules that specifies how text is compared (and by implication sorted) in a → development/Unicode/character-set, and by extension, how text is sorted.
-
The collation is used, for example, in a → development/databases/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`] clause of → development/databases/SQL[SQL]

Apparently, in Sweden, `z` is ordered before `ö` while in Germany, the `ö` is ordered before the `z`.

sa:

  Collations are especially important for → development/databases (→ development/databases/SQL/select/order-by[`order by`], `group by` etc.):
    • Oracle's → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/init-parameters/nls#ora-nls_sort[init parameter `nls_sort`], the  `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/nouns/session#ora-alter-session-set[alter session] set default_collation = …` statement
    • → development/databases/MySQL[MySQL's] parameter `collation-server`
    • The → development/databases/SQLite expression → development/databases/SQLite/sql/expressions/collate[`collate`]
    • The → misc/ISO/9075/features[SQL feature] F690.
