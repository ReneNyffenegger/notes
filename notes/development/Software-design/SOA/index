Services are autonomous and stateless (?). Their interfaces are documented and separated from the cross-cutting concerns of the implementation

One option to implement services are web services.

Some enterprise architects believe that SOA can help businesses respond more quickly and more cost-effectively to changing market conditions.



{ Properties of a service

  • It represents a business activity with a specified outcome
  • It is self contained
  • It is a black box for its consumers
  • It may consist of underlying services

}
{ Roles

  • Service provider
  • Service broker (or registry, repository)
  • Service consumer (requester)

}
{ Implementation

  A SOA can be implemented with Web services such as SOAP, REST, CORBA, Jini.
