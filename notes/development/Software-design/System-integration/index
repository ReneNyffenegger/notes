The primary objective of *software integration* is that two or more applications can collaborate with each other to complete a given task.

{ Methods

  • Horizontal integration: a decicated subsystem acts as single interface between applications (→ development/Software-design/Enterprise-Service-Bus[ESB])
  • Vertical integration: creation of *silos*
  • Star integration (aka spaghetti integration): individual subsystems are connected to mutliple other subsystems/applications.
  • Common data format

}

{ Approaches

  Three system integration approaches:
    • Data-level point to point integration
    • Application-level point to point integration
    • Process-level incorporation

}
