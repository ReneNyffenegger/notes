Scrum is an agile, easy to understand, framework (not methodology!) for software development. 

Scrum antipicates the fact that customers have no idea what they want and therefore will change their requirements.

Although easy to understand, it's hard to master.

{ Roles

  Pig roles (they're committed)
  • Product owner
  • Scrum master: to oversee the process
  • Development team (3 to 9 members)

  Chicken roles (they're involved)
  • Users
  • → development/Software-design/Project/stakeholders[Stakeholders]
  • Managers

}

{ Sprints

  Sprints are timeboxed: the duration is fixed, no matter the outcome. (However, a sprint can be cancelled by the product owner).
  -
  Typically, the duration of a sprint is 2 to 4 weeks.

  A sprint starts with a sprint planning event.

  Every day (same time/location), there's a *daily scrum* (stand-up) meeting where development impediments can be raised.
  -
  Chickens are welcome, but only pigs may speak.
  -  
  Developers answer:
    • What did I complete yesterday
    • What will I (probably) complete today
    • What is stopping me from going on

  A sprint ends with two events:
    • Sprint review
    • Sprint retrospective

}
{ Artifacts

  • Product backlog
  • Sprint backlog
  • Product increment
  • Sprint burn-down chart
  • Velocity
  • etc.

}

sa:

  Scrum is timebox based (sprints), → development/Software-design/methods/Kanban is flow based.
