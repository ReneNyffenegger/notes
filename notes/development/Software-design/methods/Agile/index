{ Agile manifesto

  We are uncovering better ways of developing
  software by doing it and helping others do it.
  Through this work we have come to value:
  table { lll
    Individuals and interactions ☰ over ☰ processes and tools
    Working software             ☰ over ☰ comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration       ☰ over ☰ contract negotiation
    Responding to change         ☰ over ☰ following a plan
  table }
  That is, while there is value in the items on
  the right, we value the items on the left more.

{ Framework

  The agile framework has 5 phases: 
    • Envision: determine vision and scope of project, complete initial planning, produce project charter.
    • Speculating: determine features to work on.
    • Exploringa: complete features.
    • Adapting: get feedback.
    • Closing: executed after last project iteration.

   Speculating, Exploring, Adapting are repeated. Therefore, it's called an *iterative* process.
