In Agile, the *Design-Code-Test* cycle is still followed: in 2-4 week sprints rather than 2-4 year cycles.

{ Manifesto for Agile Software Development

  Calling the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* the *Agile Manifesto* is wrong! The manifesto
  is not agile, rather, it describes agile software development.
 
  We are uncovering better ways of developing
  software by doing it and helping others do it.
  Through this work we have come to value:
  table { lll
    Individuals and interactions ☰ over ☰ processes and tools
    Working software             ☰ over ☰ comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration       ☰ over ☰ contract negotiation
    Responding to change         ☰ over ☰ following a plan
  table }
  That is, while there is value in the items on
  the right, we value the items on the left more.

  • Test Driven Development (TDD): The software developer first develops the test, *then* the software.
  • Feature Driven Development (FDD)
  • Crystal: process is secondary

{ Framework #agile-framework

  The agile framework has 5 phases: 
    • Envision: determine vision and scope of project, complete initial planning, produce project charter.
    • Speculating: determine features to work on.
    • Exploringa: complete features.
    • Adapting: get feedback.
    • Closing: executed after last project iteration.

   Speculating, Exploring, Adapting are repeated. Therefore, it's called an *iterative* process.

{ Fractal

  Agile software development is fractal. Everything from the project setup down to naming a variable can be done within an agile framework.
