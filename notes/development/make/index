$ make

{ Multiple processors #multiple_processors

  With multiple processors (or cores), the compilation time can be reduced by parallelizing the tasks.

  This can be achieved with `export MAKEFLAGS='-j 2'` or just `make -j2`.

  The number of available processing units can be determined with → Linux/shell/commands/nproc (`MAKEFLAGS="-j $(nproc)"`).
