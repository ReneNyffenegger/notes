$ make

Makefiles commonly describe the dependencies of source files, intermediate files (such as → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file[object files]) and executables.

{ Recursively turn each cpp file into an executable

code {
SOURCES=$(shell find -type f -iname '*.cpp')

all: $(SOURCES:.cpp=)
code }

See → https://stackoverflow.com/a/9996597/180275[this stackoverflow answer].

}
{ Rules #make-rule

  A rule consists of three parts:
    • One or → development/make/target/multiple[more targets].
    • Zero or more dependencies
    • Zero or more commands
code {
target: dependency-1 dependency-2 …
	command-1
	command-2
	…
code }

  A target is usually a file (but compare with phony targets).

  The commands must be prepended by a *tab*.

  The first rule in a makefile is the *default rule*.

}
{ Targets

  The macro `$@` evaluates to the name of the current target.

code {
foo: $(objs)
	$(CXX) -o $@ $(objs)
code }

  If make is invoked without stating an explicit target, it tries to update the first target in the makefile.

}
{ Default goal

  The first target that does not start with a dot is the *default goal*.

  The default goal can be overridden
    • wth the `.DEFAULT_GOAL` special variable
    • by specififying the name of the goal(s) on the command line when invoking `make`


}
{ Suffix rules

  Two types of suffix rules(?)
    • single suffix
    • double suffix

  Example for double suffix rule:
code {
.c.o:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
code }

  Suffix rules are obsoleted by → development/make/rule/pattern[pattern rules] (which contain `%` signs).

  The example above is equivalent to the following pattern rule:
code {
%.o : %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
code }

}
{ Macros

  Macros seem to the make specific term for *variables*.

  Macros can be defined when make is invoked:
code {
$ make CFLAGS=-g
code }

}
{ Multiple processors #multiple_processors

  With multiple processors (or cores), the compilation time can be reduced by parallelizing the tasks.

  This can be achieved with `export MAKEFLAGS='-j 2'` or just `make -j2`.

  The number of available processing units can be determined with → Linux/shell/commands/nproc (`MAKEFLAGS="-j $(nproc)"`).

}
{ Standard targets

  `all`: Default target (same as just invoking `make`). Builds the executables, libraries, documentation etc.

  `install`: install built things.
   -
  `install-strip`: like `install`, but additionally strip debugging symbols.
   -
   By default, `make install` will install the files in → Linux/fhs/usr/local/bin, → Linux/fhs/usr/local/lib etc. (That is: under → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/prefix, which can be overwritten with
   `→ development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure[`./configure --prefix=...`).
   

  `clean`: opposite of `make install`
  -
  `distclean`: Also get rid of any files that → development/GNU/toolchain/Build-System/configure[`./configure`] has created.

  `check`: run tests (if available)
   -
  `installcheck`: check the installed libraries.

  `dist`: create `PACKAGE-VERSION.tar.gz`
  -
  `distcheck`: like `dist` with additional sanity checks. Prefer `distcheck` over `dist`.

  `maintainer-clean`

}
{ Show make's default rules

  The `-p` option prints the rules and variable values (referred to as *database*) that take effect with the given Makefile.

   The `-f` option specifies the makefile (default is: `Makefile`), thus `-f → Linux/fhs/dev/null` makes sure that no Makefile is read.
code {
make -p
make -p -f→ Linux/fhs/dev/null
code }

`make` calls these default rules the »internal database«.

  { Turning each c files into an executable

    If a directory contains three c files: `foo.c`, `bar.c` and `baz.c`, then they can be compiled into the three executables `foo`, `bar` and `baz` with
    the following simple make file:

    gh|about-Makefile|/compile-each-c-file/Makefile||

   MinGW seems to name the make executable `mingw32-make.exe`.
   -
   Strawberry → development/languages/Perl[Perl] seems to name it `gmake.exe`. It also comes with a `dmake.exe`...
