$ make: multiple targets

Here's the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[c] source code of a simple program that prints the value of
the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] `EXECUTABLE_NAME`.

Because the program does not define this macro, it must be defined with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/D_[`-D option`] when
→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[`gcc`] is invoked.

Here's a simple `Makefile` that uses the concept of *multiple targets* to create an arbitrary number of executables where the value of the macro `EXECUTABLE_NAME` is assigned dynamically depending on
the name of the executable built:
