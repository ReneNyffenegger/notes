$ make: phony targets

   ~Phony targets~ are targets that is not supposed to update or create a file, but is rather a sequence of shell commands to be executed (such as the often seen *clean* target). Thus, they can
   thought of as a *shell script* within the makefile.

   In order to specifically tell make that a target is phony, there is the special `.PHONY` target name:
code {
.PHONY: clean
	rm *.o
code }

  This `.PHONY` target name ensures that the rule is run *even* if a file with the name `clean` already exists in the current directory.
