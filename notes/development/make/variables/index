{ Assigning values to variables

  There are two possible assignment operators in a Makefile: `:=` and `=`.

  `:=` evaluates the right hand side immediatly and assigns the value to the left hand side.

  `=` stores the right hand side. The evaluation takes place when the left hand side variable is evaluated.

  { Star #make-var-assign-star

    A star is a *wildcard* that expands to the names in a directory:

    gh|about-Makefile|/variables/assign-values/star.mak||

    Compare with → development/make/functions/wildcard[`$(wildcard …)`].
