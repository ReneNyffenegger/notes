$ GNU make: function $(foreach …)

code {
$(foreach  var,list,text)
code }

The following example iterates over each word in `$(list)`.
-
In each iteration, first the variable with the name `word` is set to the value of the word of the iteration, and then, the text `$(word)-$(word)` is expanded.
-
Thus, this makefile prints `foo-foo bar-bar baz-baz` when invoked.

Of course, calls to `$(foreach)` can be nested:
gh|about-Makefile|/functions/foreach/nested.mak||

When invoked, the above makefile prints `foo,ding foo,dong bar,one bar,two bar,three baz,XXX`.
