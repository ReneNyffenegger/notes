$ make: wildcard

When make sees a (Bourne shell) wildcard (such as `*`, `~`, `?`, `[…]` and `[^…`]) in a → development/make#make-rule[rule] or a prerequisite, they're expanded to the names of the files
that match the wildcard.

The following makefile tries to create an executable from all `*.c` files it find in the current directory.

gh|about-Makefile|/wildcard/example-1/Makefile||

Wildcards in commands are passed to the shell. So, these are not expanded when the makefile is run, but only when the command is run.

  → development/make/functions/wildcard[`$(wildcard …)`]
