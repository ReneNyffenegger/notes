$ git push
@ push

Update remote → development/version-control-systems/git/ref[refs] along with associated → development/version-control-systems/git/objects[objects].

A `git push` does roughly the same as a → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/fetch[`git fetch`], but in the opposite direction.

A `git push`, contrary to → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/pull[`git pull`] never performs a → development/version-control-systems/git/merge.


Pushing a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch] means to get the branch's head ref from a remote
→ development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository], find out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local
head ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which are → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit#reachable[reachable] from the local head ref, and which are missing from the remote
repository, into the remote → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database[object database], and updating the remote
head ref.
-
If the remote head is not an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.

 `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/pull`
