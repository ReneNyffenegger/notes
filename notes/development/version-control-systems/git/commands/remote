$ git remote

Manage a set of tracked → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repositories].

`git remote` allows to create, view and delete *connections* to other → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repositories].
-
Such a connection is a (usually easy-to-type) alias for a (usually harder-to-type) → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL].

After configuring such aliases, they can be used in other → development/version-control-systems/git/commands[git commands], notably in
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/pull[`git pull`] and → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/push[`git push`]
code {
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
code }

→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone[Cloning] a repository automatically creates a remote named `origin`.

These aliases (referred to as *remote entries*) are stored in a repository's → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/config[`.git/config`] file.

code {
git remote add    tq84Name https://…
