$ git commit
@ commit

Record changes to the → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository].

{ Set the author date

  The `--date` option allows to specify (or more accuratly override) the commit's so-called *author date*. The author date is typically interpreted as the timestamp when a
  → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit object] was first
  added to a → development/version-control-systems/git/repository.

  In order to demonstrate this, a git repository is created:
code {
$ mkdir repo
$ cd    repo

$ → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init
code}

  Then, three commit objects are created, each with an arbitrary author date:
code {
'one'    > file.txt
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/add    file.txt
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/commit     file.txt -m "add numbers.txt" --date '2021-01-01 11:12:13'

'two'    > file.txt
git commit file.txt -m "Version 2"       --date '2021-02-02 12:22:20'

'three'  > file.txt
git commit file.txt -m "Version 3"       --date '2021-03-13 03:33:30'
code }

  Finally, the file's log is inspected, using a format that just prints the author date (`%ai`) and the commit message's (`%s`) subject:
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/log --format='%ai  %s' --reverse file.txt
code }

  The command prints
code {
2021-01-01 11:12:13 +0100  add numbers.txt
2021-02-02 12:22:20 +0200  Version 2
2021-03-13 03:33:30 +0300  Version 3
code }

  Cleaning up:
code {
cd ..
rmdir -r -force repo
code }

}

sa:

  → development/version-control-systems/git/commands
