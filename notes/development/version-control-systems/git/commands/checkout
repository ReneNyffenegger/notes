$ git checkout
@ checkout

Switch → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branches] or restore
→ development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree[working tree files].

The `git checkout` command tells git which revision of the → development/version-control-systems/git/repository to work with.
-
After executing the command, → development/version-control-systems/git will put this revision's files into the working copy tree.

Usually, the command is given a branch name:
code {
git checkout fixFooBarBranch
git checkout master
code }

It's also possible to state the id of a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit object]
code {
git checkout 325d4d2
code }
Specifying such a commit id instead of a branch name ends up in a → development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD#detached-head

{ git checkout confusion

  There are two main functions of `git checkout`:
    • switching branches
    • restoring files

  The latter works on *paths*, the former other doesn't.
  -
  When working on paths, the behavior of `git checkout` depends on whether the path is *tree-ish* or not.
  -
  Thus, there are really three «modes of operation» with `git checkout`:
    • Switching branches
    • Copying files from the stage to the from the stage to the → development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree
    • Copying files from a *tree-ish* to the working tree

  In order to be able to distinguish between these operation modes, some of these oparations require a «double dash» (`--`).

  table { ll
    `git checkout Rel-2`             ☰ Start to work on branch named `Rel-2`.
    `git checkout -- file.txt`       ☰ Copy `file.txt` from the stage to → development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree.
    `git checkout Rel-2 -- file.txt` ☰ Copy `file.txt` from branch named `Rel-2` to working tree.
    `get checkout -- file.txt foo.c` ☰ Copy `file.txt` and `foo.c` from the stage to the working tree
    `get checkout HEAD file.txt`     ☰ Discart modifications of `file.txt` in both, the stage and the working tree
    `get checkout HEAD` ☰
  table }

  { Two new git commands meant to reduce git checkout confusion #git-checkout-confusion-2-cmd

    With the intent to reduce the confusion around the `git checkout` command, Git 2.23 introduced two new command:
      • → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/switch[`git switch`] and
      • → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/restore[`git restore`]

  }

{ Undoing an uncommited modification

  Because `git checkout` typically expects a branch name, in order to undo uncommited changes, the path to the file that is to be reverted should be prefixed with two dashes (`--`):
code {
git checkout -- path/to/file.c
code }

code {
git checkout -- .
code }



}
{ Create a branch and check it out in one go #git-checkout-b

  The `-b` command line option names a branch that is first created and then checked out to:
code {
…> git checkout -b fix-v.0.2
Switched to a new branch 'fix-v.0.2'
code }

}
