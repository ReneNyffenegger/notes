$ git checkout
@ checkout

Switch → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branches] or restore
→ development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree[working tree files].

The `git checkout` command tells git which revision of the → development/version-control-systems/git/repository to work with.
-
After executing the command, → development/version-control-systems/git will put this revion's files into the working copy tree.

Usually, the command is given a branch name:
code {
git checkout fixFooBarBranch
git checkout master
code }

It's also possible to state the id of a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit object]
code {
git checkout 325d4d2
code }
Specifying such a commit id instead of a branch name ends up in a → development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD#detached-head

sa:
  → development/version-control-systems/git/commands
