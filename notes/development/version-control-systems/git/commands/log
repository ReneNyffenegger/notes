`git log` is the same as `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/rev-list`, but with a special format.

In order to inspect a particular commit, → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/show[`git show`] might be used.

{ Show all commits where a given file was involved #git-log-commit-with-involved-file

  The following command shows all → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commits] where a given file was involved, even if the file was deleted:
code {
git log --full-history -- /path/to/file
code }

}

sa:

 `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/shortlog`.
