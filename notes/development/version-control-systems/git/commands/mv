$ git mv

Move or rename a file, a dirctory or a symlink.


{ fatal: bad source, source=path/to/*.…, destination=another/path/

  When trying to use a → Windows/PowerShell/language/wildcards[wildcard] in → Windows/PowerShell to rename a set of files,
 `git mv` might throw a *fatal: bad source, source=path/to/*.…, destination=another/path/* error.

  The following command is supposed to move all SQL files to a sub directory named `db-objects`:
code {
PS> git mv  *.sql  db-objects
fatal: bad source, source=errors/*.sql, destination=db-objects/*.sql
code }

  This is because PowerShell does → Windows/PowerShell/language/wildcards#ps-no-wildcard-expansion[not expand wildcards] by default.
  -
  The wildcard needs to be expanded explicitely:
code {
Ps> git mv (→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get *.sql) db-objects
code }

 `get-childItem` can be abbreviated with its alias `gci`:
code {
Ps> git mv (gci *.sql) db-objects
code }

}
