$ Git: Cloning a repository with the Personal Access Token in the URL

When cloning a repository from a Git server that requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication (such as for example github),
the PAT can be included in the URL:
code {
$ → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone[git clone] https://ghp_ThisIsThePersonalAccessTokenxxxxxxxx@github.com/username/reponame
code }

When doing that, the PAT will then be stored in the repository's config file `→ development/version-control-systems/git/_git/config` (see
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone/config[this link]). This might or might not be what the user intended.
-
However the case, it allows the to → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/push, → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/pull or
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/fetch[fetch] without involving a → development/version-control-systems/git/credential/helper.
