$ git clone
@ clone

code {
git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/…

code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/remote#git-remote-get-url-origin[git remote get-url origin]
code }

  → development/version-control-systems/git/URL[4 types of Git URLs]

  → development/version-control-systems/git/commands
