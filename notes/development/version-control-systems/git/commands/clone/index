$ git clone
@ clone

Clone a → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository] into a new directory.

Cloning a repository automatically creates a → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/remote[remote] named `origin`.

{ Shallow clone #git-shallow-clone

  Using the `--depth` option allows to create a *shallow* clone of a repository where the history is truncated to the specified number of the most recent commits, thus using less
  bandwith and disk space resources.
code {
$ git clone --depth 1 -b master https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git ~/linux/
code }
