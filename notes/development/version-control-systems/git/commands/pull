$ git pull
@ pull

The pull command performs actually two operations: 1) it fetches (→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/fetch[`git fetch`) changes from a remote
  → development/version-control-systems/git/branch and 2) merges (»integrates«) them into the → development/version-control-systems/git/branch#current[current branch].

rem {
  Fetch from and integrate with another → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository]
  or a local → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch].
rem }

sa:
