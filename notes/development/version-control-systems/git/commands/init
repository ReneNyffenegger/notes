$ git init

Create an empty git → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository] or
reinitialize an existing one.

Without the `--bare` option, the created repository is called a → development/version-control-systems/git/working-directory.

sa:

  Executing `git init` installes some sample hook-scripts under → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/hooks[`.git/hooks`]. These scripts come with the suffix `.sample` which needs to be removed
  to make them operational.
