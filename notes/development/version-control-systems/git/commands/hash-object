$ git hash-object

Compute → development/version-control-systems/git/objects#name[object ID] (aka *object name*) and optionally creates
a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/blob[blob] from a file.

A file's hash can be determined without being in a git repository.

{ Influence of the core.autocrlf option #git-hash-object-autocrlf

  The following commands demonstrate the influence of the `→ development/version-control-systems/git/options/core-autocrlf` option on calculating a file's hash.

  First a → development/version-control-systems/git/repository is → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init[initialized]:
  gh|about-git|/commands/hash-object/core.autocrlf/init.ps1||

  Two files are created, one with the traditional Unix → development/line-break[end of line] byte, `0x0A`, named `unix.txt`, and another one, named `dos.txt`, with the
  traditional Windows end of line semantics, `0x0D 0x0A`. I use
  the method → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/File/ReadAllBytes-WriteAllBytes[`WriteAllBytes`] of the → Microsoft/dot-net class
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/File[`System.IO.File`] in order to make sure that precisly those bytes get written I intend to.
  gh|about-git|/commands/hash-object/core.autocrlf/create-files.ps1||

  The `→ development/version-control-systems/git/options/core-autocrlf` is → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/config[configured] to `false` …
  gh|about-git|/commands/hash-object/core.autocrlf/autocrlf.false.ps1||

  … and the files' hashes are calculated.
  gh|about-git|/commands/hash-object/core.autocrlf/hash-objects.ps1||

  The command reports the hash of `unix.txt` to be `257cc5642cb1a054f08cc83f2d943e56fd3ebe99` and the hash of `dos.txt` to be
 `e48b03ece74f47d1ae20075200c64aeaa01a9cdb`. So, these files differ, as expected.

  However, with setting `core.autocrlf` to `true` … 
  gh|about-git|/commands/hash-object/core.autocrlf/autocrlf.true.ps1||
  … both files will be reported to have the same hash: the hash of `unix.txt`. 
  gh|about-git|/commands/hash-object/core.autocrlf/hash-objects.ps1||
