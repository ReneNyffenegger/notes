$ push [git]

Pushing a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch] means to get the branch'shead ref from a remote
→ development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository], find out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local
head ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which are → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit#reachable[reachable] from the local head ref, and which are missing from the remote
repository, into the remote → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database[object database], and updating the remote
head ref.

If the remote head is not an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.
