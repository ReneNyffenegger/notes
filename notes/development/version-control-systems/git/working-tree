@ working tree

The tree of actual checked out files.

A working tree is associated with excatly one → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch].

{ Clean working tree

  A working tree is *clean*, if it corresponds to the revision refrenced by the current head.

  Conversely, the tree is *dirty* if it contains modifications not commited to the current branch.

{ Determine interesting directories #git-determine-dirs-working-tree

 `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/rev-parse` has some command line options which allow to determine interesting
  directories when executed from within a working directory.

  → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init[Initialize] a new → development/version-control-systems/git/repository for the demonstration:
  gh|about-git|/working-tree/determine-directories/create-repo.ps1||

  Create directory, a subdirectory ind descend into it:
  gh|about-git|/working-tree/determine-directories/create-directories.ps1||

  Show the absolute path to the top level directory:
  gh|about-git|/working-tree/determine-directories/top-level-absolute.ps1||

  Show the relative path to the top level directory with a trailing slash (in this case: `../../`):
  gh|about-git|/working-tree/determine-directories/top-level-relative.ps1||

  Show the relative path from the top level directory to the current directory with a trailing slash (in this case `dir/subdir/`):
  gh|about-git|/working-tree/determine-directories/cur-dir-relative-to-top-level.ps1||

  Show the absolute location of the → development/version-control-systems/git/_git[git dir]:
  gh|about-git|/working-tree/determine-directories/git-dir.ps1||
