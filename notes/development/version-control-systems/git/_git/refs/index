  • → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/refs/tags[tags]: it works like the → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/refs/heads, but for → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/tag[tags] instead for branches.
  • → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/refs/remotes[remotes]: lists all → development/version-control-systems/git/repository#remote[remote repositories] that were created with → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/remote.
