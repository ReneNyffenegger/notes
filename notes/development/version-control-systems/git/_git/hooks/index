$ .git/hooks

Hooks are customization scripts used by various → development/version-control-systems/git/commands[git commands]. These scripts allow a developer to add functionality
or checking.

A hook can abort a command if something doesn't meet a requirement.

When → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init[`git init`] is executed, some sample hooks are installed. But they are initially disabled. In order to enable these, the `.sample` suffiex needs to be removed from the files.
