$ .git/branches

A slightly deprecated way to store shorthands to be used to specify an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] to
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/fetch[`git fetch`],
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/pull[`git pull`] and
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/push[`git push`].

A file can be stored as `branches/some-name` and then *some-name* can be given to these commands in place of the *repository* argument. (See REMOTES in `man git-fetch`)

The ultimate goal of branches should be to → development/version-control-systems/git/merge[merge] them.

{ upstream branch

  The default branch that is merged into the branch in question (or the branch
  in question is rebased onto).

  it is configured via branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge.

  If the upstream bfranch of A is origin/B, sometimes we say "A is tracking origin/B".

{ Switching branches

code {
git checkout new_branch_name
code }

When switching to a new branch, git update → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/HEAD.

}

sa:

  → development/version-control-systems/git/_git#_git-dir-structure[`.git` directory structure]

  → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch]

  → development/version-control-systems/git/GIT_COMMON_DIR
