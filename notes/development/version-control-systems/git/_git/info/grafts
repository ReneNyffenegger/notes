$ ./git/info/grafts

Thils file records fake commit ancestry information, to pretend the set of parents to a commit has is different from how the commit was actually created.

One record per line describes a commit and its fake parents by listing theri 40-byte hexadecimal â†’development/version-control-systems/git/objects[object names] separated
by a space and terminated by a newline.

The grafts mechanism is outdated.
