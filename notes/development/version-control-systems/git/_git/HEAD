$ .git/HEAD

A symref to the → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/refs/heads namespace, describing the currently active development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch].

HEAD is a → development/version-control-systems/git/ref.

Git only changes the content of this file when the → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branches] is changed.

{ Content of HEAD


Rather than containing a hash of an → development/version-control-systems/git/objects[object], the content of HEAD might (textually) point to a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch].
code {
ref: → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/refs/heads/branch_name[refs/heads/branch_name].
code }

}

{ detatched HEAD

  If HEAD references a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit] directly, it is called a *detached HEAD*. (`man git-checkout`)

  Normally the HEAD stores the name of a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch] and commands that operate on the history HEAD represents operate on
  the history leading to the thip of the branch the HEAD points at.

  However, Git also allows to check out an arbitrary commit that isn't necessarily the → development/version-control-systems/git/branch#tip-of-the-branch[tip of any particular branch].
  In such a state, the HEAD is called «detached».
