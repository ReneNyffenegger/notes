Git distinguishes three types of values for `credential.helper`:
table { lll
  It starts with a `!` ☰ The value after the `!` is considered to be a *shell snippet* ☰ 
  It is an absolute path ☰ The value is considered to be a (binary?) executable or a shell script ☰ `/home/rene/personal-git-helper.sh`
  Else ☰ The value is prepended with `git credential-` and then becomes the command ☰
table }
