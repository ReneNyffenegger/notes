$ Git: options

Some interesting, imho, Git options include:
table { ll
  `branch.*` ☰
  `→ development/version-control-systems/git/options/core/abbrev` ☰
  `→ development/version-control-systems/git/options/core-autocrlf` ☰ → https://stackoverflow.com/a/68265163/180275[Should be set to `false`] because it applies to all files, even binary ones and is local, not versionized in a repository. The `eol` directive in → development/version-control-systems/git/_gitattributes[`.gitattributes`] is therefore the preferred alternative.
  `→ development/version-control-systems/git/options/core/safecrlf` ☰
  `core.editor` ☰ Editor with which commit and tag messages are composed. If not set, git will use value of → development/environment-variable → development/environment-variable#editor[`EDITOR`] or → development/environment-variable#visual[`VISUAL`], if these variable are not set to `vi`.
  `core.filemode` ☰ If `true`, git will honor the → development/version-control-systems/git#git-executable-bit[executable bit] of files (some filesystem don't have such a bit). 
  `core.hooksPath` ☰ Set the (relative or absolute) location (directory) for Git hooks. Without this setting, git looks for hooks below → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/hooks[`.git/hooks`].
  `core.ignorecase` ☰
  `core.repositoryformatversion` ☰ Every repository specifies a (local) value for `core.repositoryformatversion` which specifies what operations are allowed in a repository.
  `core.whitespace` ☰ Specificies how and if whitespace problems should be notified
  `credential.helper` ☰ ? Contains a path such as `credential.helper=!"C:/Users/rene/bin/git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager-core.exe"`
  `credential.helperselector.selected` ☰ The value of `credential.helperselector.selected` might be `manager-core`
  `diff.tool` ☰ Specify the default tool with which differences between → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commits] are shown when using → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/difftool[`git difftool`]
  `difftool.prompt` ☰ `true` or (possibly better?) `false`. If `--false`, the command line option `--no-prompt` will be used when invoking `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/difftool`.
  `format.pretty` ☰  The default pretty format for the `git log`, `git show` and `git whatchanged` commands.
  `gc.reflogExpire` ☰ Controls when reachable → development/version-control-systems/git/reflog[reflogs] expire and get purged. Default is 90 days.
  `gc.reflogExpireUnreachable` ☰ Controls when unreachable → development/version-control-systems/git/reflog[reflogs] expire and get purged. Default is 30 days.
  `http.sslCAInfo` ☰ Name of the file (for example `→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Git[C:\Program Files\Git]\mingw64\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt`) that contains the → development/security/cryptography/Public-key-certificate[certificate] with which a peer is verified in → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/pull[`git pull`] or → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/push[`git push`] over → development/web/HTTPS.
  `init.templateDir` ☰ Location of the → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/_template-directory used by the `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init` command. `init.templateDir` has lower precedence than the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `$GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR`.
  `remote.origin.url` ☰ Compare with → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/remote#git-remote-get-url-origin[`git remote get-url origin`]
  `user.email` ☰ Used for *commiter information* (→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/commit[`git commit`]).
  `user.name` ☰ Used for *commiter information* (→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/commit[`git commit`]). Compare with `credential.username`.

  → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/config[`git config`] changes option values in config files.
