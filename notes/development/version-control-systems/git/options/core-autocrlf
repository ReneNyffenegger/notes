$ Git option: core.autocrlf
@ core.autocrlf

If `core.autocrlf` is set to true, Git will automatically convert Windows → development/line-break[line endings] (`0x0D 0x0A`) to Unix line endings (`0x0A`) when
adding/commit files to the index/repository and do the reverese when doing the opposite.

The idea of this behavior is to ensure that file hashes stay the same regardless of their line endings.

When setting `core.autocrlf` to `false`, no modification of line endings takes place.

As → https://stackoverflow.com/a/68265163/180275[per sthis stackoverflow answer], `core.autocrlf` should be to `false` because the value
of `core.autocrlf`
  • applies to all files, even binary ones and
  • is local, not versionized in a repository.

The `eol` directive in → development/version-control-systems/git/_gitattributes[`.gitattributes`] is therefore the preferred alternative.

`core.autocrlf` can also be set to `input` which only does the conversion from Dos to Unix line endings when
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/commit[commiting] but not on when getting a file from the repository into the
→ development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree.

The default value of `core.autocrlf` is → https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/environment.c#L55[`false`].

{ Example

  This example demonstrates the effect of setting `core.autocrlf` to `input`.

  First, we → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init[initialize] a new → development/version-control-systems/git/repository for this demonstration …
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/init.ps1||

  … and set the option `core.autocrlf` to `input`:
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/config.ps1||

  We create two files, one with a DOS line ending and one with a Unix line ending:
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/create-files.ps1||

  These files are then → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/add[added] to the → development/version-control-systems/git/index_:
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/add.ps1||

  The two files are removed from the → development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree (but not from the index) …
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/rm.ps1||

  … and → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/restore[restored] from the index into the working tree:
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/restore.ps1||

  Showing the files's bytes shows that both files now have a Unix line ending:
  gh|about-git|/options/core/autocrlf/show-bytes.ps1||

}
