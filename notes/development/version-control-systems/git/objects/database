{ Loose objects #git-db-loose-objects

  *One* file corresponds to *one* → development/version-control-systems/git/objects[object].

{ Pack files #git-db-pack-files

  In order to save space, git might choose to *pack* multiple → #git-db-loose-objects[loose objects] into
  a *pack file* (along with an `*.idx` file.

  TODO: → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/show-index

  Apparently, git uses → development/compression/zlib to compress the loose object files.
