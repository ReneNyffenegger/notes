$ Git objects

A *git object* is the unit of storage in Git. These objects are stored in the → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database[object database].

{ Object types

  Object types can be one of
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/blob[blob]
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tree[tree]
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit]
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tag[tag]

  The ~type~ of an object can be determined with → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/cat-file#git-cat-file-t[`git cat-file -t`]:
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/cat-file -t 3750c6e13c62eb71fc43a9a47c2908118cb16619
code }

}
{ View object's content

  The ~content~ of an object can be viewed with with → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/cat-file#git-cat-file-p[`git cat-file -p`]:
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/cat-file -p 3750c6e13c62eb71fc43a9a47c2908118cb16619
code }

  A git object (when available and not packed) is essentially a zlib compressed file:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/cat → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/objects[.git/objects]/c3/ab70e524983b88d363fffd74b5ff14731ccbd2  | → Linux/shell/commands/zlib-flate -uncompress
code }

}

{ Object name #name

  Git was designed like a → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage[content addressable] filesystem, that is: files can be retrieved based on their *content*.

  This leads to using the file content's → development/security/SHA-1[SHA-1 hash] as *identifier* for the object to be stored in the → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository].

  Synonyms for the SHA-1 value are  *object name*, «hash» and «object identifier».

  The SHA ID can be computed with `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/hash-object`.

}

{ pack #pack

  To save space (for example when transmitting them), git compresses a set of objects into a *pack*.

  The *pack index* is a list of identifiers and other information of the pack.

}

{ Unreachable object

  An object which is not reachable from a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch], tag or other reference.

}

{ Looking at the object graph

code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/log --graph --oneline --decorate
code }

}

{ Storage location

  Objects are stored in the → development/version-control-systems/git/_git[`.git`] directory under the directory `objects/ab/cde…` where `abcde…` is the stored object's SHA-1 hash value.
