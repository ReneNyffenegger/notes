$ Git objects

A *git object* is the unit of storage in Git. These objects are stored in the → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database[object database].


{ Object types

  Object types can be one of
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/blob[blob]
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tree[tree]
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit]
    • →development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tag[tag]

  The type of an object can be determined with
code {
git cat-file -t 3750c6e13c62eb71fc43a9a47c2908118cb16619
code }

}

{ Object name #name

  An object is identified by the → development/security/SHA-1 of the object's content.
  Synonyms for the SHA-1 value are  *object name*, «hash» and «object identifier».

  This ID can be computed with `→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/hash-object`.

}

{ pack #pack

  To save space (for example when transmitting them), git compresses a set of objects into a *pack*.

  The *pack index* is a list of identifiers and other information of the pack.

{ Unreachable object

  An object which is not reachable from a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch], tag or other reference.
