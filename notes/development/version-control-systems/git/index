$ Git

Git das not store changes, but *states*.  Git doesn't care about → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encodings], it just tracks bytes.

Commands operate on the history of the → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[current branch].

{ Branches

  { Show current branch
  
code {
git branch
code }
  
  Prints a list of local branches of the repo. The current branch is prefixed with a star.
  
  }
  { List current set of branches

code {
git branch -a
code }

  }
  { Delete a branch

code {
git branch -d name-of-branch
code }

If branch not fully merged:
code {
git branch -D name-of-branch
code }

  }

}

{ Configuration

code {
git config ...
code }

Three files involved:
`→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_gitconfig`, `→ development/version-control-systems/git/_git/config`, `$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig`. (Where is `$(prefix)` defined?)

}

{ git behind a firewall

  { Windows

  code {
c:\> set HTTP_PROXY=http://DOMAIN\\USER.NAME/192.168.1.100:8080
c:\> git config --global http.proxy %HTTP_PROXY%
  code }

  }

}

{ git init

code {
git init
code }

Creates a new → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository].

Files and directories created
  • → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/index

This new repository contains one → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch]: → development/version-control-systems/git/branch#master.

}

{ git log

  Shows commit (id, author, timestamp) made in the repository.

}

{ Configuration files

  { Porcelain commands

    Git has three levels of configuration files that can change the output of porcelain commands:
      • `$prefix/etc/gitconfig`
      • `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_gitconfig`
      • `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config`

  }

}
{ Installation

  { Windows #git-install-windows

    On Windows, git can be installed with `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/winget_exe[winget]`:
code {
PS C:\> winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
code }

  }

{ Tuomo Valkonen's on Git

  Tuomo Valkonen's quote somewhat resonates with me:
  "
    I will not touch Git with a long stick. It is the → Microsoft/Office/Word[Microsoft Word] of
    → development/version-control-systems[version control systems]: a massive waste of time, a fiddly piece of junk, that for
    reasons unfathomable found its way everywhere. I have much better uses for
    my brain cells and time than to study for a PhD in gitology, prerequisite
    for using a tool that gets in the way of doing the job instead of simply
    doing it. If you want to work with me, you have to use a well-designed,
    user-friendly, modern version control system, such as Mercurial, Darcs, or
    Fossil — almost anything but Git!

{ TODO

  {  Windows / core.autoclrf

    I have the strong impression that I am better off configuring git on → Windows with a false `core.autoclrf`:
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/config --global → development/version-control-systems/git/options/core-autocrlf false
code }

  }
  { Executable bit #git-executable-bit

    Git not only tracks file content but also the files' executable bits (on file systems that support it, that is).

    There are two *modes* that git is a able to assign to a file: `100644` for regular files and `100755` for executable files.

    The mode of a file can be shown with
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/ls-files  -s  bin/build.sh
code }

    This bit can be modified with
code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/update-index  --chmod=+x  bin/build.sh
code }

    See also the `core.filemode` → development/version-control-systems/git/options[option].

  }
  { Empty directories / .gitkeep

    Git is unable to track empty directories.
    -
    In order to mark a directory as «logically empty», a convention is to put (a zero size) file named `.gitkeep` into the directory.

   *Of course*, the directory is then not empty anymore, but people familiar with this convention at least recognize that the directory is supposed to be empty.
