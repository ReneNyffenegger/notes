$ git: working directory
@ working directory

Working directories are → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[Repositories] that are created with → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/init[git init] (but not with
`git init --bare`).

The working directory represents *where* a → development/version-control-systems/git/repository is checked out.

The top level directory of a working directory contains
  • a → development/version-control-systems/git/_git[.git directory] and
  • a → development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree

{ TODO

  The `--work-tree` option.

}
