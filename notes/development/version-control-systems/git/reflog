$ reflog [git]
@ reflog

A reflog is a *reference log*.

They're needed to specify old values of a reference (e.g. `HEAD@{10}`, `master@{one.week.ago}` …)

Reflogs are found under → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs:
  • → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs/HEAD stores the history of → development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD values
  • → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs/refs stores the history of all → development/version-control-systems/git/ref[refs], including the ref → development/version-control-systems/git/stash.
  • → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs/refs/heads/some-branch-name stores the history of the head of *some-branch-name*

{ Expiration

  The information stays in the reflogs until they expire.
  -
  By default, that is 30 days for unreachable → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commits] and 90 days for
  reachable commits.

  The default can be overwritten with the config values `gc.reflogExpireUnreachable` and `gc.reflogExpire`, respectively.
