$ reflog [git]
@ reflog

A *reflog* (= reference log) logs changes to *references* such as the tips of branches etc.

They're needed to specify old values of a reference (e.g. `HEAD@{10}`, `master@{one.week.ago}` etc., compar with → https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions[gitrevisions]).

Reflogs are found under → development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs:
  • `→ development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs/HEAD` stores the history of → development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD values
  • `→ development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs/refs` stores the history of all → development/version-control-systems/git/ref[refs], including the ref → development/version-control-systems/git/stash.
  • `→ development/version-control-systems/git/_git/logs/refs/heads/some-branch-name` stores the history of the head of *some-branch-name*

{ Expiration

  The information stays in the reflogs until they expire.
  -
  By default, that is 30 days for unreachable → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commits] and 90 days for
  reachable commits.

  The default can be overwritten with the config values `gc.reflogExpireUnreachable` and `gc.reflogExpire`, respectively.
