{ Shallow repository

  A shallow repository has an incomplete history some of whose commits have parents cauterized away (in other words, Git is told to pretend that these
  commits do not have the parents, even thoght they are recorded in the commit object). This is sometimes useful when you are interested only in the recent history
  of a project even though the real history recorded in the upstream is much larger. A shallow repository is created by giving the `--depth` option to `git clone`.
  Its history can later be deepened with `git fetch`.

  Some times, a shallow repository is referred to as «shallow clone» (although this phrase makes it more explicit that it was created by `git clone --depth`.
