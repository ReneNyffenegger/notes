{ alternate object database

  Via the alternates mechansism, a repository can inherit part of its object database from another object databse, which is called an «alternate»

}
{ chain

  A list of objects, where each object in the list contains a reference to its successor (for example, the successor of a commit could be one of its parents).

}
{ checkout

  The action of updating all or part of the → development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree[working tree] with a
  → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tree[tree object] or → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/blob[blob] from the
  → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database[object database], and updating the index and HEAD if the whole
  working tree has been pointed at a new branch.

}
{ cherry picking

  Extract the change introduced by an existing commit and to record it based on the → development/version-control-systems/git/branch#tip-of-the-branch[tip of the current branch] as
  new commit.

}
{ commit-ish / commitish

  A → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit object] or → development/version-control-systems/git/objects[object] that can be
  recursively dereferenced to a commit object.

  The following are all commit-ishes: commit object, → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tag[tab object] that points to a commit object,
  a tag object that points to a tag object that points to a commit object etc.

}
{ core Git

  Fundamental data structures and utilities of Git. Exposes only limited source code management tools.

  Core Git also goes by the name of «plumbing».

  Programs and program suites that depend on core Git and present a high level access to core Git are called «porcelain». They expose more of
  an SCM interface than the plumbing.


}
{ dangling object

  An unreachable → development/version-control-systems/git/objects[object] which is not reachable even from other unreachable objects. A dangling object has no
  reference to it from any reference or object in the repository.

}
{ evil merge

  An evil merge is a merge that introduces changes that do not appear in any parent.

}
{ fast-forward

  A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have a revision and you are merging another → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch's] changes that happen to
  be  a descendant of hat you hae. In such cases, you do not make a new merge commit but instead just jupdate to this revision.

  This will happen frequently on a remote-tracking branch of a remote → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository].

}
{ pickaxe

  The term pickaxe refers to an option to the diffcore routines that help select changes that add or delete a given text string. With the `--pickaxe-all` option, it can
  be used to view the full changeset that introduced or removed, say, a particular line of text. (see `git diff`).

}
{ per-worktree ref

  Refs that are per-worktree, rather than global. This is presently only HEAD and any refs that start with `refs/bisect`, but ight later include other unusual refs.

}
{ pseudoref

  Pseudorefs are a class of files under → development/version-control-systems/git/_git which behave like refs for the purpose of rev-parse, but which are treated specially by git.
  Pseudorefs both have names that are all-caps, and always start with a line consisting of a → development/security/SHA-1 followed by whitespace. So,
  → development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD is not a pseudoref, bbecause it is sometimes a symbolic ref. They might optionally contain
  some additional daa. MERGE_HEAD and CHERRY_PICK_HEAD are examples. Unlike per-worktree refs, these files cannot be symbolic refs, and never have reflogs. They also
  cannot be updated through the normal ref update machinery. Instead, they are updated by directly writing to the files. However, they can be read as if they were refs, so `git rev-parse MERGE_HEAD` will
  work.

}
{ rebase

  To replay a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commits] from a → development/version-control-systems/git/branch[branch]
  to a different base, and reset the head of that branch to the result.

}
{ refspec

  A refspec is used by → development/version-control-systems/git/branch#fetch[fetch] and → development/version-control-systems/git/push[push] to describe
  the mapping between remote ref and local ref.

}
{ rewind

  To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the head to an earlier revision. 

}
{ submodule

  A repository that holds the history of a separate project inside another repository (the latter of which called superproject)

}
{ superproject

  A repository that references repositories of other projects in its working tree as submodules. The superproject knows about the
  names of (but does not hold copies of) commit objecs of the contained submodules.

}
{ tag

  A tag is a special → development/version-control-systems/git/ref[ref] used as to mark a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit] in the history.

  A ref under `refs/tag/` namespace that points to an object of an arbitrary type (typically a tag points to either a tag or a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit[commit object]).

  In contrast to a head, a tag is not updated by the `commit` command.

  A tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the commit ancestry chain.

}
{ tree

   Either a → development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree or a → development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tree[tree object] together with
   the dependent blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working tree).

}
{ unmerged index

  An index which contains unmerged index entries.

}
