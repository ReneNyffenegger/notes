$ github Web API: v3 / REST

{ Upload file

  Sometimes, I just want to upload a file to a given → development/version-control-systems/git/github[github] repository without cloning the repository, changing the file, commiting the changes and
  the pushing the new commit.

  With github's web API, this is possible with the following → Windows/PowerShell function:
  gh|github-web-API|/v3-REST/upload-file.ps1||

}
