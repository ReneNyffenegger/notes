{ Using github's Rest API

  Github's Rest API is accessed on → https;//api.github.com/

  The answers are returned in → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON.

Some requests:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/curl_exe https://api.github.com/
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/curl_exe https://api.github.com/users/ReneNyffenegger
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/curl_exe https://api.github.com/users/ReneNyffenegger/repos
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/curl_exe https://api.github.com/repos/ReneNyffenegger/about-PowerShell

→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/curl_exe → tools/cURL#curl-u[-u] ReneNyffenegger:MySecret https://api.github.com/xxxx
code }

  See also → development/version-control-systems/git/github/web-API[here].

  { X-RateLimit-Limit / X-RateLimit-Remaining

    The two response → development/web/HTTP/header[headers] `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaing` inform how many requests an unauthenticated client can make in a time frame (of one hour?)
    and how many requests can still be made in this time frame.

  }
  { Using Personal Access Tokens

    A *personal access token* authenticates a client when doing an API request.

    The two important features of access tokens are:
      • Revokable access
      • Controlling scope of access

    Thus, with an access token, it's possible, for example, to inquire about
   *private* repositores (if the token is granted accessing private repositories.)

    Such a personal access token must be generated, for example, when logged in github, in → https://github.com/settings/tokens/

    When authenticated with an access token, the request limit raises to 5000/hour.

    With curl the request is made like so:
code {
$accessToken=01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef012345
curl -u x:$accessToken https://api.github.com/repos/ReneNyffenegger/about-PowerShell
code }

  With → Windows/PowerShell, its possible to use an access token like so
code {
$secString=→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/secureString/convertTo[convertTo-secureString] $accessToken -asPlainText -force
invoke-webrequest https://api.github.com/repos/ReneNyffenegger/private-repo -authentication bearer -token $secString
code }

  2020-03-10: Apparently, the `-authentication` option of `invoke-webRequest` is only avaible with PowerShell 6 and later. In earlier versions, the
 `-header` option can be used;
code {
$accessToken=01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef012345
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/webRequest/invoke[invoke-webrequest] https://api.github.com/repos/ReneNyffenegger/private-repo -headers @{Authorization = "Bearer $accessToken"}
code }

    While access tokens can be configured to allow or deny certain actions, these actions are allowed on all repository, it's not possible to limit them
    to specific repositories.

{ Searching for a string in my projects on github

  With → Companies-Products/Google[Google's] `site:` and `inurl:` search options, it's possible to find specific source code in someone's repositories
  on github:
  → https://www.google.ch/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=onresize+site%3Agithub.com+inurl%3AReneNyffenegger[onresize site:github.com inurl:ReneNyffenegger]

{ TODO

  → https://github.com/topics[Topics] help to classify repositories with tagsw (such as → https://github.com/topics/dataquality[dataquality]) in order to help find these repos.
  -
  These topics can be changed unter the link *Manage Topics* on a repository's main page.
