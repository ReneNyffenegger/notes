$ Github gist

A *gist* is a simple way to share a code snippet.

Technically, a gist is a → development/version-control-systems/git/repository[repository]. Thus, the snippets are versioned and can be forked.

After a gist has been created, it can be embedded on a website using a special *embed link* that is obtained on a gist's site.

A gist is indexed by → Companies-Products/Google[Google] using Github's Google Juice (not to be confused with Google Guice).
