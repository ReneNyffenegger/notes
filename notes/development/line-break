$ Line break
@ line break

A *line break* in DOS/→ Windows text files consists of a → development/line-break#cr followed by a → development/line-break#lf.

In *Unix* text files, it only consists of a → development/line-break#lf.

On *MACs* prior to MAC OS X, it was a → development/line-break#cr. With/since MAC OS X, they use Unix endings, too.

{ CR #cr

  Carriage return: `\x0D` or `\r`.

}
{ LF #lf

  Line feed: `\x0A` or `\n`.

}
{ Changing line endings #change-line-endings

  { dos2unix

    The Linux → Linux/shell[Linux shell] command → Linux/shell/commands/dos2unix[`dos2unix`] changes DOS line endings in a file to UNIX endings.

  }
  { PowerShell

    In → Windows/PowerShell, line endings might be changed with something like
code {
[→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/File[IO.File]]::WriteAllText(
   "→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[$pwd]\file.unix",
   [IO.File]::→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/File/ReadAllText[ReadAllText]("$pwd\file.dos") → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/string-manipulation#ps-replace[-replace] ("`r`n", "`n")
)
code }

    Text that contains Unix *and* DOS endings might be converted to text that contains DOS endings *only* like so
code {
$txt_mixed = "@$([char]0x0a)@$([char]0x0d)$([char]0x0a)@"
$txt_dos    = $txt_mixed -replace "(?<!`r)`n", "`r`n"

# verify result:
$text_dos | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/hex/format[format-hex]
…
…   40 0D 0A 40 0D 0A 40
code }

  }
}

  → development/tools/scripts/personal/show-newline_pl[`show-newline.pl`] is a → development/languages/Perl script that shows line endings in a file.
  -
  → development/tools/scripts/personal/dos-or-unix_pl[`dos-or-unix.pl`] is another Perl script that tries to determine if a file has DOS or Unix line endings.

  In → Microsoft/dot-net, the value for the line break that is used on the current platform can be queried with `→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Environment[System.Environment].NewLine`.

  The → development/languages/Perl/functions/chomp[Perl function `chomp()`] removes trailing new lines in variables that contain lines of text.
  -
  The functionality of `chomp()` can be imitated in → development/languages/Python with → development/languages/Python/types/string/rstrip[`str.rstrip('\n\r')`].

  In Python, a → development/languages/Python/types/string[string] containing line breaks can be split into its lines using the method `str.splitlines()`.

  The → development/vim/options[VIM options] → development/vim/options/endofline and → development/vim/options/fixendofline.

  The → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] constant that signifies a line break is `vbCrLf`.

code {
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/config[git config] --global → development/version-control-systems/git/options/core-autocrlf false
code }

  The → development/notepad-plus-plus menus → development/notepad-plus-plus/GUI/menu/Settings/New-Document[Settings -> Preferences -> New Document] and
  → development/notepad-plus-plus/GUI/menu/Edit/EOL-Conversion[Edit -> EOL Conversion]

  The number of line breaks in a file can be counted with the shell utility `→ Linux/shell/commands/wc`.
