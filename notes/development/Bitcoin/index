Bitcoin: an electronic peer to peer version of money. Bitcoins can be sent from buyer to seller
without the overhead of financial institutions.

It also tackles the problem of *double spending*.

Bitcoin is based on ~cryptographic proof~ rather than ~trust~.

Because bitcoin is decentralized and has no government, (central-!) bank, company regulating it, there is
nobody than can prevent the payment to anyone nor does anyone need the someone's permission to send
→ development/Bitcoin/coin[bitcoins]. This is a good thing.


{ Prove of ownership of a bitcoin

  The bitcoin technology allows someone to prove he *is* actually in possession of a specfic bitcoin.
  
  In order to do that, they have to send their public → development/Bitcoin/address[address], signed
  with their private key.

  If this message can be decoded, the ownership of their → development/Bitcoin/account is proven. Then
  it's possible to check the balance and the → development/Bitcoin/transactions[transaction] history.
