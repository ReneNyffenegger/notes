{ Prove of ownership of a bitcoin

  The bitcoin technology allows someone to prove he *is* actually in possession of a specfic bitcoin.
  
  In order to do that, they have to send their public → development/Bitcoin/address[address], signed
  with their private key.

  If this message can be decoded, the ownership of their → development/Bitcoin/account is proven. Then
  it's possible to check the balance and the → development/Bitcoin/transactions[transaction] history.
