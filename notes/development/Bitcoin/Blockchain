$ Blockchain [Bitcoin]
@ blockchain

The blockchain's two main ingredients: military grade → development/security/cryptograph[encryption] plus distributed system.

{ Blocks #blockchain-block

  A block is a record in the blockchain.

  The size of a block is limited to 1 MB.

  A new block is added at to the blockchain at almost a constant rate approximately every 10 minutes. (Is this still the case???)
