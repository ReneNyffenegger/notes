abbr: Windows Script Host

A → Windows/development/COM[COM] based environment for scripts.

WSH itself does not run scripts. They're run by → development/languages/VBScript or → development/languages/JScript.
-
Although reputed as being antiquated and unelegant language, these two languages are powerful when it comes to interacting with
→ Windows/Management-Instrumentation[WMI].
-
Apparently, these languages are the only two languages that are supported by the *ActiveScriptEventConsumer* event consumer.
-
Also, on older System where → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] is not installed, there is hope to find at least WSH.

The Windows Script Host is started with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cscript_exe[`cscript.exe`] (for console environments) or
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wscript_exe[`wscript.exe`] for Window (GUI) environments.


{ Windows Script Host object model

  WSH includes the following → Windows/development/COM based libraries which are commonly referred to as *WSH objects*:
    • WshShell
    • WshNetwork
    • WshController
    • Scripting Runtime Library

  The WScript object is the root object in the Windows Script Host hierarchy.

}

{ Disabling Windows Script Host

  → Windows/registry/index: Setting the value of `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows-Script-Host/Settings[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script Host\Settings]\Enabled` or
                                 `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-Script-Host/Settings[HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script Host\Settings]\Enabled` to 0.

  If the WSH is disabled, trying to execute it results in a *Windows Script Host access is disabled on this machine. Contact your administrator for details.* error.
