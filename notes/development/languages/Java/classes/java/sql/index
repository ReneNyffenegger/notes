$ Java package: java.sql

The `java.sql` package is referred to as the *JDBC core API* while → development/languages/Java/classes/javax/sql[`javax.sql`] is referred to
as the *JDBC Optional Package API*.

{ JDBC API versioning

? The API version numbers seem to be independent from the J2EE (or J2SE) version number.

{ Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform

  When I tried to execute the first example on this page, I received this error:
  *Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\Oracle\19\bin\ocijdbc19.dll: *Can't load AMD 64-bit .dll on a IA 32-bit platform*

  This was because my → Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[`PATH`] variable pointed to an (apparently 32-bit version) JDK that was not located under 
  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/jdk[`%ORACLE_HOME%\jdk`].

  In order to fix this eror, I had to explicitly use the `javac` and `java` executables under → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/jdk[`%ORACLE_HOME%\jdk`].
