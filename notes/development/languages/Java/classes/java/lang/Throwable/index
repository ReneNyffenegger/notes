$ Java class java.lang.Throwable

`java.lang.Throwable` (not → development/languages/Java/classes/java/lang/Exception[`java.lang.Exception`]) is the base class of all classes that can be thrown.

Two important subclasses that derive from `java.lang.Throwable` are
  • → development/languages/Java/classes/java/lang/Exception[`java.lang.Exception`]
  • → development/languages/Java/classes/java/lang/Error[`java.lang.Error`]

{ Checked and unchecked exceptions

  A class that derives directly or indirectly from `java.lang.Throwable` is either *checked* or *unchecked*.

  A method that might throw a *checked* exception has to declare this exception as potentially be thrown. Hence, a caller of the method in the call-stack needs to `catch` the exception.

  On the other hand, an unchecked exception can be thrown without the method having it declared accordingly.

  Examples of *unchecked* classes include
    • `java.lang.Error`
    • → development/languages/Java/classes/java/lang/RuntimeException[`java.lang.RuntimeException`]

  Examples of *checked* classes include
    • `java.lang.Exception`
    • … ?
