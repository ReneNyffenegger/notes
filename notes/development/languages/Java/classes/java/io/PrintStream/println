$ Write text to standard out (console) with with println

`println`, which is defined in the class class `java.io.PrintStream` allows to write text into a stream.

As it happens, `System.out` is an instance of `java.io.PrintStream` which points to standard out. Thus, it is possible to write
text to the console with `System.out.println("some text")`.
