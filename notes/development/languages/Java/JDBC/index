  Type 1 drivers required → development/databases/ODBC for coummincation with the → development/databases[database]. Type 1 drivers are discontinued with Java 9.

  Type 2 drivers require a platform (OS) dependent library for communication with the database.

  Type 3 drivers is a pure → development/languages/Java (thus not platform dependent) library that comminucates over a server side middleware with the database

  Type 4 drivers require no middleware solution.
