{ JDK / JRE etc

   JDK (aka Java SDK) consists of
     •  JRE
     • `javac` (compiles Java source code to byte code)
     •  Javadoc: document generator
     • `jdb` (debugger)
     • `jar` (archiver)
     •  etc…

   JRE (aka Java Runtime Environment / JRE) consists of:
     • core classes
     • JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

   The JVM provides a (runtime) environment in which Java bytecode is loaded, verified and executed.

   Starting with JDK 9, there are two releases per year: one in March and one in September.
