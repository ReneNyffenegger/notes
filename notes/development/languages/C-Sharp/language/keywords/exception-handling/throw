$ C#: throw

`throw` is a variant of `goto`.

Unlike `goto`, the programmer of the `throw` statement does not specify a label where the execution of the program is transferred to. It will be one of the (hopefully?) available
→ development/languages/C-Sharp/language/keywords/exception-handling/catch[`catch`] blocks up the calling hierarchy.

`throw` also differs from `goto` in that the programmer passes an instance of a class that derives from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Exception[`System.Exception`] to the receiver. This allows to
  • pass → development/Data from the caller of `throw` to the receiver in `catch(ExCls data)`.
  • somehat limit the possible set of `catch()` blocks that are able to receive the thrown class
