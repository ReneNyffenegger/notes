$ C#: object initializer

An *object initializer* is a → development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] construct that allows to create a new object and assign values to its (`public`) fields and/or properties:
code {
TYPE obj = → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/operators/new[new] TYPE() { property_1 = value_1 , field_2 = value_2 , … property_n = value_n } ;
code }

The following code snippet tries to demonstrate a simple (and useless) example for object initializers.

  Object initializers can be used to create → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/classes-structs/anonymous-types[anonymous types]. These are especially useful in LINQ query expressions.
