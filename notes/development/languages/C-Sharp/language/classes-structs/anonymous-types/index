$ C# - anonymous types

Anonymous types are classes that directly derive from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object[`System.Object`] and consist of *read-only properties* only. They don't methods, events or anything else.

Because the names for anonymous types are provided by the → development/languages/C-Sharp/compiler[compiler], instances of anonymous types are typically declared with the → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/keywords/built-in-types/var[`var` keyword].

Anonymous types are constructed with the → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/classes-structs/initializer/object[object initializer] syntax, yet without a type-name (hence the name *anonymous types*).

Anonymous types are especially useful in LINQ queries.
