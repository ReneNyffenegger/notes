$ C# - cast operator

`(type)` is the *cast operator*: `(T) V` casts the variable `V` to the type `T`.

The cast operator is similar to the → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/operators/type-testing_cast/as[`as` operator]. However, if the cast is impossible, the cast operator throws
a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/InvalidCastException[`System.InvalidCastException`] (in the same case, the `as` operator evaluates to `null`).
