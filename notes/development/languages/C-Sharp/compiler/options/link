$ csc -link

`csc -link:/path/to/assembly.dll` makes the → Windows/development/COM type information in `assembly.dll` available to the project being compiled.

This is practical for COM-Interop projects because the application is not dependent on a PIA (Primary Interop Assembly) when running on the target machine.

sa:
  `-link` (like `-reference`)  uses the → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/csc_rsp[`csc.rsp`] file.
