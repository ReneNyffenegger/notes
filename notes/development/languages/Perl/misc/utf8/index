$ Perl and utf8

code {
use feature 'say';

use utf8;
say unpack('H*', 'ü');

no utf8;
say unpack('H*', 'ü');
code }

The script above prints prints, if encoded in UTF-8:
code {
fc
c3bc
code }

`fc` is latin-` (→ misc/ISO/8859) for ~ü~, `c3 bc` is utf-8 for ~ü~.

{ TODO


  `use feature 'unicode_strings';`: This pragma was created to explicitly tell Perl that operations executed within its scope are to use Unicode rules.
  -
  It thus changes the interpretation of strings.
  -
  `use 5.012` implicitely turns on the usage of this feature.

  `:encoding(...)` in → development/languages/Perl/functions/open[`open`]

  `use utf8;` enables recognition of characters *if* the script is writtin in → development/Unicode/UTF-8.
