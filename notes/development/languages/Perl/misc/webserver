$ A (simple) webserver with Perl

This is a very simple webserver written in → development/languages/Perl.
-
It consists of two parts (files): `webserver.pl` and `http_handler.pl`.

`webserver.pl` is the core, so to speak, that accepts new connections and creates a thread for each connection.

`http_handler.pl` is the file that actually defines what should be done at a request.
-
Currently, `http_handler.pl` must expose two sub's: `http_request_handler` and `init_webserver_extension`.
-
The port on which the webserver listens should be set within init_webserver_extension by assigning the port number to the variable `$port_listen`. 

{ webserver.pl
gh|perl-webserver|/adp-gmbh/webserver.pl||
}

{ http_handler.pl
gh|perl-webserver|/adp-gmbh/http_handler.pl||
}

These scripts were originally hosted on my old web site (→ http://www.adp-gmbh.ch[`http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/perl/webserver/`]).
-
They can also be found on → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/perl-webserver/tree/master/adp-gmbh[github].

{ Thanks

  Thanks to ~Rob Neild~ who informed me that this server leaked memory without the `$t->detach();` after the creation of the thread.
