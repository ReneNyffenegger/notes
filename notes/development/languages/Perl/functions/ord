$ Perl function: ord
@ ord

On most platforms/systems, `ord` returns the → development/Unicode → development/Unicode/Codepoints[codepoint] for the given character. This is not the case on platforms where the legacy encoding is
some variant of EBDIC rather than a superset of ASCII.

The reverse function of `ord` is → development/languages/Perl/functions/chr[`chr`].

  → development/languages/Perl/functions/index
