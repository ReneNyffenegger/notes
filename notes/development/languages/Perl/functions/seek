$ Perl function: seek

The following example script reads two lines from itself (→ development/languages/Perl/variables/0___name_of_program[`$0`]). Then, it uses `seek` with a negative argument to
go back in the input file by the length of the second line. Thus, next next line that is read from `$f` is the second line (which will be assigned to `$second_line_again`).

When the script is run, it will print `use warnings;`.
