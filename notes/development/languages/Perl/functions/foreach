$ Perl: foreach statement
@ foreach

{ Aliasing elements #perl-foreach-alias

  When iterating over a list the iteration variable is aliased to the elements in the list. Thus,
  it's possible to change the values within the list in a `foreach` statement:

  gh|about-perl|/functions/foreach/localizing-variable.pl||

  Python doesn't seem to → development/languages/Python/statements/for#py-for-in-list[do that].

}
{ Localizing variable

  The value of the variable in the `foreach` loop is only visible in the loop (and lost afterwards).

}
