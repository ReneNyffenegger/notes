$ Perl: regular expression to substitute within matched region

With the → development/languages/Perl/functions/s__e[e flag], it's possible to first match certain portions of a text *and then* substitute only those parts that have actually matched.

The → development/languages/Perl/functions/s[substitution] matches text between two `#` (the regex is `#(.*?)#`) and then turns the matched text into uppercase 
(using → development/languages/Perl/functions/uc[`uc`]).
