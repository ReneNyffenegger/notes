$ Perl module Net::HTTP::Async

I *believe* the following script should work as per → https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Async::HTTP#EXAMPLES[this example], yet it does not.
No `$url` is passed via `fmap_void`.

I had much better results with → development/languages/Perl/modules/Net/Curl/Multi[`Net::Curl::Multi`].
