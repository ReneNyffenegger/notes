$ Perl module Net::Curl::Multi

`Net::Curl::Multi` seems to be *the* Perl module to download internet resources in parallel.

When experimenting with parallel downloading, I also tried
  → development/languages/Perl/modules/HTTP/Async[HTTP::Async] and
  → development/languages/Perl/modules/Net/Async/HTTP[Net::Async::HTTP], both of which were not really satisfying.


gh|PerlModules|/Net/Curl/Multi/script.pl||

sa:

  → development/languages/Perl/modules/index[Perl modules]
