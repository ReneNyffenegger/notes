$ Perl module: Tree::Create::DepthFirst
@ Tree::Create::DepthFirst

`Tree::Create::DepthFirst` allows to create a tree (→ development/languages/Perl/modules/Tree/Simple) by adding its nodes in the same sequence (or order) which they would/will be
returned if the tree is traversed depth first.

{ Simple demonstration

  The following simple script demonstrates how `Tree::Create::DepthFirst` is supposed to work.

  The array `@nodes` is a list of elements, each with a depth and a value.
  -
  The elements of this list are added (`$tree_creator->addNode()`) to the tree being created.

  Then, the final tree is stored in `$tree` (`$tree = $tree_creator->getTree()`).

  Now, the `$tree`'s method `traverse` will call the supplied callback function for each node (and leaf) found
  in the tree. The callback function verifis if in fact the nodes stored in the tree are returned in the same
  order as they were previously added

  Here's a piece of a html docoument (→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/PerlModules/blob/master/Tree/Create/DepthFirst/parse-html-ul-li.html[parse-html-ul-li.html]):
code {
  <ul><li>0<ul><li>0.0<ul><li>0.0.0<ul><li>0.0.0.0<li>0.0.0.1</ul>
  </ul></ul><ul><li>0.1</li></ul></li><li>1<ul><li>1.0</li><li>1.1
  </li><ul><li>1.1.0<li>1.1.1</ul></ul></li><li>2</li><li>3<ul><li>3.0
  <ul><li>3.0.0</li><li>3.0.1</li><ul><li>3.0.1.0<li>3.0.1.1</ul>
  <li>3.0.2</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>3.1</li><li>3.2</li></ul></li></ul>
code }

  When rendered in a browser, this gibberish looks like this:

  Now, I want to reconstruct this tree with a Perl script.
  -
  So, I combine the → development/languages/Perl/modules/HTML/Parser → development/languages/Perl/modules[Perl module] with Tree::Create::DepthFirst:

gh|PerlModules|/Tree/Create/DepthFirst/parse-html-ul-li.pl||
  
  When the script is executed, it will print
code {
