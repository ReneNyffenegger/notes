$ Perl module Crypt::CBC

{ encrypt_decrypt.pl

  This simple script encrypts and decrypts a file. When the file name ends in `.crypt`, it is decrypted, otherwise, it is encrypted.
  When the is encrypted, the script appends `.crypt` to the filename.

  When run, the script needs the environment variable `TQ84_CBCCRYPTPASSWORD` set.

  I have no idea if the script is cryptographically secure. Feedback would be very welcome.
