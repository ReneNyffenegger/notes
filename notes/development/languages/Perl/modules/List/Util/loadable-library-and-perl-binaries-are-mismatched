$ ListUtil.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched (got handshake key 0xde00080, needed 0xce00080)

*2018-12-07*: I had this error on my → Linux/distributions/arch distribution. It was probably caused because I installed → development/languages/Perl/modules[Perl modules] with
→ development/languages/Perl/modules/_cpan[`cpan`] rather than using → Linux/distributions/arch/pacman[`pacman`].

As per → https://stackoverflow.com/a/51186495/180275[this stackoverflow answer], I was able to at least temporarly get rid of this error by unsetting `PERL5LIB`
(which pointed ad `/home/rene/perl5/lib/perl5`) and unsetting `PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT` which pointed at → Linux/fhs/home/username/perl5.
