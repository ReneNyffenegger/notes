{ Problems

Apparently, `GraphViz2::DBI` is very picky about the create table statements (in → development/databases/SQLite?)
Doing it a bit differently (though correctly, as far as i know), resulted in a `Primary table 'T1'. Foreign table 'T2'. Unable to find primary key name for foreign key 'col_a'` error.

Thankfully, → http://search.cpan.org/~rsavage/[Ron Savage] helped me out on this problem.
