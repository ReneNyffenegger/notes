$ Perl module HTTP::Async 

The following script can be used to compare the performance of `HTTP::Async` with that of a sequential downloading with → development/languages/Perl/modules/LWP/UserAgent[`LWP::UserAgent`] 
(or → development/languages/Perl/modules/LWP/Simple[`LWP::Simple`], for that matter).

Unfortunately, when I tried this performance test, it showed that `HTTP::Async` is actually slower because it somehow freezes for a while after adding a new request. I am therefore not sure if
I have used the module correctly and as intended.

I had much better results with → development/languages/Perl/modules/Net/Curl/Multi[`Net::Curl::Multi`].

The global variable `$with_HTTP_ASYNC`, which currently must be manually edited in the script, determines if the download of the resources is done in parallel or in sequence.
