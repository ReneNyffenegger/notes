$ Perl module DBD::SQLite - using sqlite_create_function to specify a user defined Perl function.

With `sqlite_create_function`, it's possible to add a user defined function (`sub`) to SQLite that then can
be used in SQL statements:

{ Creating a function

  gh|PerlModules|/DBD/SQLite/sqlite_create_function.pl||

}
{ Counting the function calls

  When a variable is declared with → development/languages/Perl/functions/state[`state`], it's possible to count
  how many times the function is called.

  gh|PerlModules|/DBD/SQLite/sqlite_create_function.count-calls.pl||

The output is:
code {
bar   2   1
baz   5   7
foo   8  13
code }

  This shows that when using aggregate functions, the function is called more often that technically necessary

}
