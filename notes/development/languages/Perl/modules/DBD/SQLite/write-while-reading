$ Perl module DBD::SQLite - Inserts in select loop

The following example intends to demonstrate how readers don't block writers and writers don't block readers if → development/databases/SQLite/pragmas/index#pragma-journal-mode[`journal_mode`] is set to `WAL` (Write-Ahead Log).

First, two connections to the database are established, one for writing access and one for reading access.

The writing connection creates a table and inserts three records and commits them.

Then, the reading connection iterates over these records with a `select * from`. After each fetch of a record, the writing connection inserts a record and commits it.
The reading connection won't see these records.

After the first `select * from`, the reading connection does it again.
This time, it sees the records that were inserted.

It is suggested trying to comment the lines where the pragma is enabled. It might cause dead locks.
