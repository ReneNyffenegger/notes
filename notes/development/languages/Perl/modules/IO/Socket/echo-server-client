$ echo server and client with Perl module IO::Socket

The following two scripts is a simple demonstration of using → development/languages/Perl/modules/IO/Socket[`IO::Socket`] for a server and a client.

`echo-server.pl` just listens on port 2808. When a client connects to that port, the script will return whatever it receives from the client back to the client, with a
prepended `OK`.

`echo-client.pl` connects to the server. Whenever the user types somthing on the console (STDIN), it forwards it to the server and then prints the server's answer.
