{ Determining filename and directory name from path

  Unfortunately, `dirname()` and `basename()` think that the directory of the path `/tmp` is `/` and the file is `tmp` (even if the path is `/tmp/`!).

  A better way to determine the directory name and the file name from a path seems to be
code {
(my $filename) = $full_path =~ m!/([^/]+)$!;
(my $dirname ) = $full_path =~ m!(.*)/[^/]+$!;
code }

}
