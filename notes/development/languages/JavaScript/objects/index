  An *object* is a collection of zero or more (named?) *properties*.
  -
  These properties store one of
    • a *primitive value* (which is a member of one of the → development/languages/JavaScript#js-primitive-built-in-types[built-in primitive types])
    • another object
    • a function (which is called a *method* if associated with an object via property)

  A property is identified by its *key value* which is
    • a string (referred to as *property name*), or
    • a *Symbol* (which is a → development/languages/JavaScript#js-primitive-built-in-types[built in type])
  
  Each property can be assigned *attributes* that further control how the property can be used. For example, it's possible to set the *Writable* attribute of a property to `false` so that
  it cannot be assigned a different value.

  A property is one of
    • data property
    • accessor property
  
  A ~constructor~ is a → development/languages/JavaScript/objects/Function[`Function` object] that is stored in an object's property named `prototype`.
