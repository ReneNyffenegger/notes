$ JavaScript: operator typeof 

`typeof(obj)` returns a → development/languages/JavaScript/code-snippets/objects/String[String] that describes the type of `obj`.
-
`typeof` does not throw an error if `obj` does not exist at all, it just returns the string `"undefined"`.

The possible returned values are:
  • undefined
  • object
  • boolean
  • number
  • string
  • function
  • symbol (new with ECMAScript 2015)

Since the set of return values is rather small, a better way to find out with what object someone is dealing, `obj.constructor.name` might be more constructive.
