$ JavaScript: iterator and iterable

In order to be able to iterate over an → development/languages/JavaScript/objects[object] in → development/languages/JavaScript, two specific so-called *protocols* must be implemented:
the *iterable* and the *iterator* protocol.

The *iterable protocol* requires an object to define an `@@iterator` method which returns an *iterator object*.

The *iterator protocol* requires this returned *iterator object* to define at least a `next()` method that returns an object that has at least
the two properties `value` and `done`. As long as `done` evaluates to true, the iterating mechanism will call `next()`.

The following snippet of code is an attempt to demonstrate the iterator and iterable protocol:
