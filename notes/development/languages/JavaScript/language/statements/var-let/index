$ JavaScript - Variable declaration statements: var and let

The `var` and `let` → development/languages/JavaScript/language/statements[statements] declare → development/languages/JavaScript/language/variable[variables].

The `var` statement declares a variable that is scoped to the running execution context's *variable-environment*. In a browser environment, but not in Node.js, that means that
the variable is created as a property in the *global object*.

The `let` (and `const`) statements declare (define) a variable that is scoped to the running execution context's *lexical environment* (and thus is not created as property in the *global object*).
