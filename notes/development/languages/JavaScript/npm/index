*npm* is the default *node package manager* for → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js and is automatically installed along with → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js.

The three main components of npm are
  • a website?
  • a command line interface
  • a registry to access a database of JavaScript software

{ Installing npm

code {
→ tools/cURL[curl] -qL → https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | → Linux/fhs/bin/sh[sh]
code }

  Note to self: do not be attempted to install like shown below, it will (as of 2023-03-29) install node version 12 (while version 18 is the current one):
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo[sudo] → Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt/install nodejs npm -y
code }

  { TODO

    → https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm[nvm (node version manager)] is recommended to install Node.js and npm.

  }

}

{ Packages and modules

  → https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules[About packages and modules] says:
    • A *package* is a file or directory that is described by a `package.json` file
    • A *module* is any file or directory in the `node_modules` directory that can be loaded by the → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js[Node.js] → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js#node-js-require[`require()`] function.

  { Package

    A package is (see `npm help install`)
      • a) a folder containing a program described by a npm help `package.json` file
      • b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
      • c) a url that resolves to (b)
      • d) a <name>@<version> that is published on the registry (see npm help registry) with (c)
      • e) a <name>@<tag> (see npm help dist-tag) that points to (d)
      • f) a <name> that has a "latest" tag satisfying (e)
      • g) a <git remote url> that resolves to (a)

{ Installing packages

 `npm` allows to install packages, for example → development/databases/SQLite[SQLite]:
code {
npm install sqlite3
code }

 `npm` is also the preferred way to install Yarn which is another package manager:
code {
npm install --global yarn
code }

  `sudo` should not be used to globally install packages. Therefore, the → https://stackoverflow.com/a/53717874[npm installation directory need to be made accessible before installing package]:
code {
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules}
code }

}

{ TODO

 `npx` runs a command from a local (`node_modules/.bin`) or remote (`/usr/local/bin` and `%APPDATA/npm`?) npm package.
 `npx` is depracated (and its functionality seems to be provided by `npm exec`)

 `/usr/share/nodejs`

  Compare to yarn.

 `npm help shrinkwrap`

  For `npm init xyz`, `xyz` is considered *package initializer*. This seems to be a JSON file located at https://registry.npmjs.org/create-xyz

  { Package visibility/scope

      A package's scope determines its visibility (aka access level).
      
      Scope is one
      table { ll
        Org ☰ Allows to specifiy team members
        User ☰ Grants are given to users (not team members)
        Unscoped ☰
      table }

      Access level is:
      table { ll
        public ☰ Everyone can download and view packages
        private ☰ Only owners or team embers/users granted read can download and view packages. Only team members with write right or users given write right or package owners can publish a package.
      table}

      There is no unscoped private scope. Thus, there are five possible combinations of scope and access levels.

      The name of the scope can optionally appear as first part of a package name: `@orgname/packagename`.
