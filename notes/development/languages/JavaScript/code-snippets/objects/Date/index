$ Javascript: Date object
@ Date

A → development/languages/JavaScript `Date` object stores a number that is to interpreted as milliseconds after (or before, if this number is negative) January 1st, 1970, → misc/UTC.
Thus, this number is different from → development/date-time/Unix-time[Unix time] (which is a number that is to be interpreted as *seconds* from January 1st, 1970).

{ constructor

}
{ getDate() and getDay()

 `getDay()` returns the date's *day of the week* while `getDate()` returns the date's day of the month.

}
{ getYear() and getFullYear()

  Apparently, `getYear()` is depracted; `getFullYear()` should be used instead.

}
{ getTime()

}
{ parse()

  The use `Date.parse()` is discouraged because different → development/web/browser[browsers] implemented this function inconsistently.
