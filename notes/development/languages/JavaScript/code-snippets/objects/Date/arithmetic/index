$ JavaScript: Date arithmetic

{ Adding days

  The following example tries to demonstrate how days might be added to a date.

  It turns out that, at least on → development/web/browser/Firefox and → development/web/browser/Chrome, it is not possible to
  add *fractional days*. Instead, hours must be added with `setHours(… getHours() + … )`

  The output of this example, on my computer, is:
code {
Thu Aug 28 2014 22:23:24 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)
Fri Aug 28 2015 22:23:24 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)
Fri Jan 15 2016 22:23:24 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)
Sat Jan 16 2016 22:23:24 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)
Sun Jan 17 2016 03:23:24 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)
code }

}
