*GeoJSON* is an → development/Data/exchange/formats[exchange format] for geospatial → development/Data, based on → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON, hence the name.

The coordinate reference system of GeoJSON is the *World Geodetic System 1984* with the values transmitted in *decimal degrees*.

GeoJSON is primarily used for
  • JavaScript web-mapping libraris,
  • JSON-based document databases and
  • Web APIs

{ GeoJSON types

  GeoJSON defines seven geometry types, the Feature type and the FeatureCollection type.

  { Geometry types

    Geometry objects represent
      • Zero dimensional points, or
      • One dimensional curves, or
      • Two dimensional surfaces

    The *Geometry types* supported by GeoJSON are defined in the *OpenGIS Simple Features Implementation Specification for SQL* (SFSQL):

    table { ll
      Point ☰
      LineString ☰
      Polygon ☰
      MultiPoint ☰
      MultiLineString ☰
      MultiPolygon ☰
      GeometryCollection ☰
    table }

    The GeoJSON representation of the instances of these geometry types
    correspond to the binary (WKB) and text (WKT) representations as
    described in SFSQL.

  }
  { Features and FeatureCollections

    In addition to the geometry types, GeoJSON also defines the following types:
    table { ll
      Feature ☰ A geometry object with addtional members
      FeatureCollection ☰ A collection (array) of feature objects, analogous to that of the *Web Feature Service* (WFS) response to `GetFeatures` requests or to a Keyhole Markup Language (→ tools/Google-Earth/kml[KML]) folder of placemarks
    table }

  }
}
{ Representation of GeoJSON objects

  Each object is a → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON object.

  Each object's type is specified with the `type` attribute (whose value is a string and corresponds to one of the nine
  specified object types).

  An object can optionally have a `bbox` attribute which is an array of coordinates.

  An object may also have other attributes.

  { Representation of a FeatureCollection

    A FeatureCollection is an array of features.
  
    Each feature has a geometric object, sotred in
    the object named `geometry`.
  
  
  ? Features have freely definable properties.

code {
{ "type"    : "FeatureCollection",

  "features": [

     {
        "type"      :"Feature",
        "geometry"  : {
                        "type"       : "Point",
                        "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
                      },
        "properties": {
                        "prop0": "value0"
                      }
     },
     {
        "type"      :"Feature",
        "geometry"  : {
                        "type"       : "LineString",
                        "coordinates": [
                           [102.0, 0.0],
                           [103.0, 1.0],
                           [104.0, 0.0],
                           [105.0, 1.0]
                        ]
                      },
         "properties": {
                        "prop0": "value0",
                        "prop1":  0.0
                       }
      },
         …
  ]
}

{ Misc

  The → development/web/Multipurpose-Internet-Mail-Extensions[media type] for GeoJSON is `application/geo+json`.

  File extensions are `.json` and `.geojson`.

  The → Windows/clipboard[Windows Clipboard] name is *GeoJSON*.

  → development/version-control-systems/git/github renders GeoJSON files as a map.
