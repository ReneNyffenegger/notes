$ JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
@ JSON

JSON is a simple (as in lightweight) standard for → development/Data/exchange[exchanging (structured) data].

The *media type* for JSON is `application/json`.

{ Features and design goals 

  The main features and design goals of JSON include
    • It's text based (so, also humans, not only machines, can read and create JSON documents)
    • It's minimal: JSON defines only a very small set of rules
    • Portability
    • Subset of → development/languages/JavaScript

  Because of this simplicity, JSON has become popular and many websites use JSON instead of
  → development/XML to serialize → development/Data for communication between server applications and their clients.

}
{ Javascript origin

  JSON originates from the object literals of → development/languages/JavaScript (ECMAScript) and is specified in
  → development/web/RFC#rfc-7159[RFC 7159] (The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format).
  -
  In fact, JSON is referred in ECMA-262 (see also ECMA-404 (The JSON Data Interchange Format)).

  Because the JSON syntax originates in JavaScript, it is possible to use → development/languages/JavaScript/objects/global/function-properties/eval[`eval(jsonDocument)`] in JavaScript to parse
  a JSON document.
  -
  Of course, this poses a *security risk* (like that of → development/databases/SQL/injection) if the JSON document contains executable code.

}
{ Tokens

  The *grammar* of JSON has only six structural characters:
  table { ll
    `{` and `}` ☰ They contain an object
    `[` and `]` ☰ They contain the elements of an array
    `:` ☰ The colon separates a key from a value in an object
    `,` ☰ The comman separates the elements in an array
  table }

  Besides them, there are three other kinds of tokens:
    • strings:  a sequence of → development/Unicode[Unicode] characters, enclosed between a pair of `"`.
    • numbers
    • literals (`true`, `false` or `null`)

}
{ Comments

  The JSON specification does not support comments in JSON.

}
{ Primitive data types (scalars)

  JSON specifies four *primitive data types*. Each *scalar* value has one of these data types.

  table { lll
    ~Data Type~ ☰ ~Example~ ☰ ~Comment~
     String ☰ `"string"` ☰ A sequence of zore or more → development/Unicode characters (→ development/Unicode/UTF-8 (default), UTF-16 or UTF-32).
     Number ☰ `42`, `-13.9` ☰ Represented in base 10; leading zeros or plus signs are not allowed.
     Boolean ☰ `true`, `false` ☰ The only two values whose data type is *boolean*.
     Null ☰ `null` ☰ The only value whose data type is *null*.
  table }


  { Strings
 
    → development/web/RFC#rfc-7159[RFC-7159] contains the following remarks about strings:
    "
       The representation of strings is similar to conventions used in the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C family] of programming languages.
       A string begins and ends with quotation marks.  
       All Unicode characters may be placed within the quotation marks, except for the characters that must be escaped:
       quotation mark, reverse solidus [aka backslash], and the control characters (U+0000 through U+001F).

       Any character may be escaped.  If the character is in the Basic
       Multilingual Plane […], then it may be
       represented as a six-character sequence: a reverse solidus, followed
       by the lowercase letter u, followed by four hexadecimal digits that
       encode the character's code point.
    "

    RFC-7159 also says that some characters can be represented with two characters: `\n`, `\t`, `\\` etc.

    Thus, the following is a correct JSON string that contains quotes and a → development/line-break[new line]: `"He said:\n\"hello\"."`.
  }  

  { No built-in date type

    JSON does not specify a data-type for dates and/or times.
    -
    However, dates are generally stored in JSON as strings in the → misc/ISO/8601 format.

  }

}
{ Structured types

  The primitive data types are building blocks to create *structured types*.

  There are two structured types:
  table { ll
    objects ☰ *Unordered* set name/value pairs
    arrays ☰ *Ordered* list of values (whose data type need not to be the same)
  table }

  The terms *object* and *array* have their origins in → development/languages/JavaScript (see JavaScript → development/languages/JavaScript/objects[objects] and → development/languages/JavaScript/objects/Array[arrays])

  { Objects

    JSON objects are embedded in curly braces (`{ … }`).

    A JSON object consists of comma separated *key-value pairs*. The key is a string and is separated from the value by a colon (`:`).
    -
    These key value pairs are referred to as *members*.

code {
{
   "item": "Lemon",
   "price": {
         "val":      1.84,
         "currency: "CHF"
   }
}
code }

  }
  { Arrays

    Arrays are embedded in square brackets: `[ … ]`.

    An array is an ordered, comma-separated list of JSON values.

code {
[ "foo",
   42,
   null,
   { "foo": "bar" }
]
code }

  }

}
{ Values

  A value is either a primitive or a structured type.
