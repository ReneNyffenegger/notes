$ JSON Web Token

? A → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON Web Token (JWT) is an access token which allows to exchange verifiable claims.

A JWT header consists of the three fields
table { ll
  `typ` ☰ The value is always `JWT`
  `cty` ☰ Content type, used when the payload contains another JWT (in which case the value of `cty` should be `JWT`)
  `alg` ☰ The algorithm which was used to sign (typically HMAC with SHA-256 (HS256) or RSA with SHA-256 (RS256)).
table }

A JWT is either signed using a
  • private secret, or a
  • public/private key.

{ Misc

  RFC 7519 suggests to prononce JWT like *jot*.
