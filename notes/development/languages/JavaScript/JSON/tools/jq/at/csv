$ jq: @csv
@ @csv

`@csv` formats each incoming arrays as → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV record, thus, it processes a series of arrays, not an array of arrays.

Note the → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/tools/jq/options/r-raw-output[`-r`] (raw output) option in the following example:
code {
$ echo '
  [42, "Hello world"]
  [99, "Ninety nine"]
' |
  jq -r @csv
42,"Hello world"
99,"Ninety nine"
code }
