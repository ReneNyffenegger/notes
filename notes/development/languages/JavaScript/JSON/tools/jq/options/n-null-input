$ jq -n

`→ development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/tools/jq -n` (or `jq --null-input`) runs the filter once with `null` as input (for example to construct JSON data from scratch)

code {
$ jq -n '{id: (1,2,3)}'
{
  "id": 1
}
{
  "id": 2
}
{
  "id": 3
}
code }

The same output can also be produced with `jq -n '{id: → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/tools/jq/operators-functions/range[range](3)}'`.
