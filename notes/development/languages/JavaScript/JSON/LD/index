$ JSON-LD

JSON-LD stands for *JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data* and is intended to be a pure data exchange format for directed graphs
and is designed to be usable directly as → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON[JSON] (without knowledge of → https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-rdf11-concepts-20140109/[RDF]).
It can be used, however, in conjuction with RDF.

A JSON-LD document is always a valid JSON document. So, they can be processed with standared JSON libraries (such as the → development/languages/Perl/modules[Perl module]
→ development/languages/Perl/modules/JSON[JSON]).

JSON-LD targets developers who are already familiar with → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON[JSON]. They only need to learn two new keywords (`@context` and `@id`) to use
the basic functionality of JSON-LD.

{ Example

code {
<→development/web/HTML/tags/script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "url": "http://renenyffenegger.ch",
  "contactPoint": [{
    "@type": "ContactPoint",
    "telephone": "+41-76-558-70-68",
    "contactType": "sales"
  }]
}
</script>
code }
