  Most (all?) graphical → development/web/browser[web browsers] have a JavaScript Engine, for example:
    • → development/web/browser/Firefox: Spidermonkey
    • Safari: JavaScriptCore
    • → development/web/browser/Chrome: V8

  → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js also uses the V8 engine

  { primitive built-in types #js-primitive-built-in-types

  The values of the primitive built-in types is → development/Data that is not stored with or in an → development/languages/JavaScript/objects.

    ECMAScript defines the following *primitive built-in types*:
    table { ll
      ~Type~ ☰ ~Range of values~
      Undefined ☰ one value: `undefined`
      Null ☰ one value: `null`
      Boolean ☰ `true` and `false`
      Number ☰ → development/IEEE/754[IEEE-754]-2008 64-bit double-precision numbers
      BigInt ☰ (?, not defined by ECMAScript ?)
      String ☰ A sequence of zero through 2⁵-1 16-bit unsigned integer values («elements»)
      Symbol ☰ The set of strings that may be used as the key of an → development/languages/JavaScript/objects#js-object-properties[object property]
    table }

    All primitive built-in types except `null` and `undefined` have ~object wrappers~ so that their values can be stored in or with objects.
    -
    The respective wrapper objects' `valueOf()` method returns the primitive value again.


  }
  { Object

    Then there is the non-primitive built-in type → development/languages/JavaScript/objects/Object[`Object`].
  }

    `call` vs `apply`
