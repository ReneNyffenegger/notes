$ The SpiderMonkey JavaScript shell

The shell is started with the `js` or `js24` command.

A → development/archive-files/zip[zipped] pre-compiled executable can be downloaded from the → https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/[nightly builds directory]. 

{ Running a script

  In order to run a sequence of → development/languages/JavaScript statements (a script), the shell can be invoked with the name of the script:
code {
$ js24 script.js
code }

  The content of `script.js` might just be something like this:
  gh|about-SpiderMonkey-shell|/script.js||

  Apparently, the `-f` option can be used to explicitely state the name of the scritp:
code {
$ js24 -f script.js
code }

}
{ Evaluating a string

  A string can be evaluated as JavaScript with the `-e` option:
code {
$ js24 -e 'print (6*7)'
code }

}
{ Executable scripts

  A script can be → Linux/shell/commands/chmod[`chmod`'ed] to contain the executable bit so that a script can be executed directly from the shell:
code {
$ ./executable-script.js
code }

  `executable-script.js` might look like this:

  gh|about-SpiderMonkey-shell|/executable-script.js||

  Note, Mozilla's → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Introduction_to_the_JavaScript_shell[Introduction to the JavaScript shell] proposes to
  add a `-P` in the first line. I found that to be wrong, at least in my  environment.
