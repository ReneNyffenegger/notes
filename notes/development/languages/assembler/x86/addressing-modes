$ Assember (x86/x64): addressing modes

The addressing mode specifies how an address of a memory location is calculated.


→ https://stackoverflow.com/a/34058400/180275[x86/x64 has the following addressing mode forms] and its sub-variants:
code {
section:[ base-register  +  index-register * N  +  displacement ]   ; N ∈ {1,2,4,8} / displacement a 32-bit constant. section is optional
        [ RIP                                   +  displacement ]   ; 64-bit only? Aka RIP-relative mode?
code }

Any → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[register] can be a `base-register`, any register except `rsp`/`esp` can be an `index-register`.

The referenced registers have to be the same size (unless → https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39173410[an alternate address size is used]???).

{ RIP-Relative

 *RIP-relative mode* supports modern operating systems by providing a *flat address space* with a single code, data and stack space. 

  This mode is the default addressing mode in 64-bit programs.

{ AT&T syntax vs Intel syntax

  The Intel indirect syntax reference of the form `section:[base + index*scale + disp]` is translated into the AT&T syntax `section:disp(base, index, scale)`. (AT&T requires section to be prefixed with a `%`).

  table { ll
    Intel ☰ AT&T
    `[esi]` ☰ `(%esi)`
    `[ebp-8]` ☰ `-8(%ebp)`
    `[ebp*4 + 0100]` ☰ `0x100(, %ebx,4)`
    `[edx+ebx*4 + 8]` ☰ 0x8(%edx,%ebx,4)`

  table }

}

sa:
  With the → development/languages/assembler/x86#x68-lea[`lea`] instruction, it's possible to assign the *value* of an address rather than the value of the location that that address points at.
