$ int 3

`int 3` calls the *debug exception handler*.

`int 3` is similar to a far → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/call[`call`] instruction. But it also pushes the `eflags` register on the stack before it pushes the return address.
The → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/iret[`iret`] instruction will jump back and pop the `eflags` register.

Opcode: `0xcc`

  The → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/intrinsic[cl intrinsic] function → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/intrinsic/__debugbreak[`__debugbreak()`] and
  the → Windows/development/WinAPI[WinAPI] function `DebugBreak()`.

  → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions[x86/x64 instructions]
