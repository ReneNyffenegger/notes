$ int 3

`int 3` calls the *debug exception handler*.

`int 3` is similar to a far → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/call[`call`] instruction. But it also pushes the `eflags` register on the stack before it pushes the return address.
The → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/iret[`iret`] instruction will jump back and pop the `eflags` register.

Opcode: `0xcc`
