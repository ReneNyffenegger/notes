  • → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/pop[`pop`] the value that the → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers/stack-pointer[stack pointer] points at into the → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers/instruction-pointer[instruction pointer] (thus, the stack pointer is increased)
