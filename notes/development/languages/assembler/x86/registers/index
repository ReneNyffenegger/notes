$ x86/x64 assembler: registers

eax, ebx, ecx, edx: 32 bit general purpose register (GPR) 
-
ah, bh, ch, dh: Upper 16 bits of respective GPRs
-
al, bl, cl, dl: Lower 16 bits of respective GPRs
-
64 Bit version like 32 bit, but with RAX, RBX …

? Originally, the A, B, C and D stood for:
  • A = Accumulator
  • B = Base
  • C = Counter
  • D = Data

The eax register is used to return values from functions. it has also a special semantic for arithmic functions.
-
ecx has special semantic for looping functions.

esp: → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers/stack-pointer[stack pointer]
-
ebp: → development/languages/assembler/x86/stackframe/base-pointer[base pointer], can be used in high level languages for to reference function parameters and local variables on the stack.

esi: source for string operations
- 
edi: destination for string operations
-
Some instructions, such as `rep stosb`, `rep movsb` or `rep scasb`, can only be done using these two registers.

Debug registers: `dr0`, `dr1`, `dr2`, `dr3`, `dr6` and `dr7`.

Control registers: `cr0`, `cr2`, `cr3`, `cr4` (are they loaded with the → development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/mov[`mov`] instruction?)

System table registers: `gdtr`, `ldtr`, `idtr`

MSR registers

MMX registers: `mm0` through `mm7`

XXM regisgters: `xmm0` through `xmm7`

Registers that are (apparently exclusively) used in *real mode*:
 • cs: code segment
 • ds: data segment
 • ss: stack segment
 • es, fs, gs: arbitrary segments
 
In a Win32 environment, the `FS` register points to the current → Windows/development/process/thread[thread's] → Windows/development/process/thread/TIB[TIB], in a Win64
environment, it's the `GS` register.


Apparently, recent x86 models feature a *thermal status register*. 

x87 fpu registers `st0` through `st7`

{ FLAGS / status register

  eflags, rflags

  Control flags: they control the → hardware/CPU[CPU]'s operation.

  Status flags:
    • carry flag (CF): set if result of *unsigned arithmetic* operation is too large for destination.
    • overthrow flag (OF): set if result of *signed arithmetic* operation is too large for destination.
    • sign flag (SF): set if arithmetic or logical operation results in a negative outcome.
    • zero flag (ZF): set if result of arithmetic or logical operation is zero.
    • auxiliary carry flag (AC)
    • parity flag (PF)

  { Direction flag

     The *Direction flag* applies to `REP`-instructions such as `MOVS`, `MOVSD`, `MOVSW` etc.

     If it is set, strings are processed from highest to lowest address (»auto decrementing«), if it is cleared,
     strings are processed from lowest to highest address (»auto incrementing«).

     The direction flag is cleared with the `CLD` istruction and set with the `STD` instruction.

  }
  

}
{ Segment registers

  An instruction that refers to a memory address implicitly uses a *segment register*.
  For example, a jump instruction uses `cs`, a push instruction uses `ss`.

  Most segment registers can be assigned a value with the `mov` instruction. However `cs` can only be assigned with `jmp` and `call`.

  There are six segment registers: `cs`, `ds`, `ss`, `es`, `fs` and `gs`.

}
{ x86_64

  The registers were extended to 64 bits: `rax` … `rdx`, `rsp` etc.

  General purpose registers were added: `r8` … `r15`. The lower 32/16/8 bits of these registers are referred to as
  `rXd`, `rXw` and `rXb`.

}
{ Clobber registers

  With respect to an API (such as the → Windows/development/WinAPI[WinAPI]), registers that can be overwritten in a function of this API are called *clobber registers*.

  In the 32-bit WinAPI, the clobber registers are `eax`, `ecx` and `edx`.
  In the 64-bit WinAPI, all registers are clobber registers except `rbp`, `rbx`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `r12`, `r13`, `r14` and `r15`.

}
{ TODO

  The `CONTEXT` structure (that is defined in `winnt.h`.

  → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[MSVC] comes with intrinsics to read the `fs` and `gs` registers: `__readfs*` and `__readgs*`.
