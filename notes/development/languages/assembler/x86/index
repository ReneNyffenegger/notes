$ Assember (x86/x64)

Since the x86 has evolved over three decades during which it had to respond to different »market forces« while maintaining *backward compatiblity*, the x86 assembly language is charged with an immense legacy:
  • 16 bit → hardware/CPUs/x86/modes#x86-real-mode[real mode]
  • real mode within *virtual 8068 mode* (x86-64 discontinued *virtual protected mode*)
  • protected mode (16 or 32 bits)
  • enhanced mode (64 bit)


{ Instructions

  Instructions have one to three operands, most often two:
code {
not  eax
add  eax, ebx
imul eax, edx, 64
code }

}
{ mov

  Apparently, there is no instruction to directly move data from one memory location to another. It always needs to go via a → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[register].

  `cs`, `eip` and `ip` cannot be the destination.

  The following `mov` instruction is illegal, because the registers are not the same size.
code {
mov al, esi
code }

  The following `mov` instruction, howver, *is* legal: it assigns the *byte* that is pointed at by `esi` to `al`:
code {
mov al, [esi]         ; think  char al = *((char*) esi)
code }

  Assign a constant to the destination:
code {
mov al, 0ABh
code }


}
{ Memory reference (pointers)

code {
add [esp], eax ; add value of eax to value of memory pointed at by esp (top of the stack).
code }

}
{ lea #x68-lea

 `lea` stands for *load effective address*. It does not dereference the address but «returns» a calculated (value of an) address. 

 `lea` does not alter flags.

code {
lea eax, [ eax + ebx   + 42 ] ; eax := eax + ebx + 42
lea eax, [ eax + ecx        ] ; eax := eax + ecx
lea eax, [ ebx + ebx*N      ] ; eax := ebx + N*ebx = (N+1)*ebx, N ∈ {1,2,4,8}
lea eax, [ rdi + rsi*4 - 8  ] ; …
code }


  Both of the following statements increment `eax` by one, but `lea` does not change `eflags` while `inc` might do (or always does) so:
code {
lea eax, [eax + 1]
inc eax
code }

  { LEA vs MOV

code {
lea eax, <memory-expression>  ; eax := address of memory expression 
mov eax, <memory-expression>  ; eax := value   at memory expression
code }

  }
  { Calculating 37 * a

   `lea` allows to calcuate → https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46480579[37*x with only two instructions]:
code {
leal    (%rdi,%rdi,8), %eax      # eax = a * 9
leal    (%rdi,%rax,4), %eax      # eax = a + 4*(a*9)
ret
code }

  }

}
{ div / idiv

Results stored in eax and edx (rest of division)

code {
mov eax, 42 ; load dividend
mov ecx,  5 ; load divisor
div ecx     ;
code }

}
{ Jump instructions (branching)

  A branching instruction changes the `eip` (instruction pointer) register if the given conditions are met.

  The `call` instruction jumps uncoditionally.
  -
  It stores the `eip` on the stack so that the callee can return to the caller.


}
{ push / pos

 `push` *first* decrements(!) the stack pointer `esp`, *then* places the pushed value to the memory location pointed at with `esp`.

 `pop` *first* loads the indicated destination with the value that `esp` points at, *then* increments `esp`.

}

{ Stack frame operations


  The ~stack pointer~ `esp` stores the top (bottom) of the stack.

  The → development/languages/assembler/x86/stackframe/base-pointer[base pointer] (`ebp`) stores the value of the stack pointer when the current function was entered.
  -
  Thus, the first instructions of a function are commonly:
code {
pushl	%ebp            ; Save base pointer of calling function
movl	%esp, %ebp      ; Load base pointer with current stack pointer
subl	$40, %esp       ; Make room for a few local variables.
code }
  After setting up the stackframe like this, various values can be accessed via the base pointer (whose value does not change in the context of the function):
    • `ebp+ 0`: the previous value of the `ebp` register.
    • `ebp+ 4`: the return address.
    • `ebp+ 8`: the first parameter.
    • `ebp+12`: the second parameter, etc.
    • `ebp- 4`: the first local variable.
    • `ebp- 8`: the second local variable, etc.
  

  A function is then left with
code {
leave                ; FIRST set esp = ebp THEN pop ebp.
ret                  : esp points now to return address: pop it into eip.
code }


  `leave` is equivalent to:
code {
mov esp, ebp
pop ebp
code }


}
{ Sections

  Sections group portions of code and data which have similar purpose or should have the same memory permissions.

  Common names:
    • `.text`: code, never to be paged out.
    • `.data`: read/write (global variables)
    • `.rdata`: read only data (e.g. strings)
    • `.bss`: block storage start (or block started by symbol). Uninitialized data (only size of objects is specified). The .bss section seems to be merged into the .data section by the linker. Since it contains unintialized data, it helps to reduce the size of the object file and is »expanded« into memory when the executable is loaded.
    • `.reloc`: relocation information, used to modify addresses.
    • `.idata`: import address table. (Seems to be merged into with .text or .rdata).
    • `.edata`: export information
    • `.rsrc`: ressources
    • `PAGE*`: pagable code. Apparently mainly used for → Linux/kernel/drivers[kernel drivers].

   Unneeded seections can be disposed of with `strip`.

}
{ Data for operands

  The data for an operand can be stored
    • in an immediate (const value?)
    • register
    • memory location

   The address of a memory location can be calculated by `base + index*scale + displacement`.
   -
   base: `e{a,b,c,d}x`, `e{s,b}p`, `e{s,d}i`
   -
   index: `e{a,b,c,d}x`, `ebp`, `e{s,d}i`
   -
   scale: 1, 2, 4 or 8
   -
   displacement: 0, 8, 16 or 32 bit

   → hardware/CPUs/Intel[Intel] syntax: `[base + index*scale + disp]`
   -
   AT&T syntax: `disp(base, index, scale)`.

   { AT & T: $ prefix

     In AT&T syntax, a number or symbol without the `$` prefix is always a *memory operand*: `movw 0x0a, %ax` loads the value pointed at in `ds:0x0a` into `%ax`.

     With the `$` prefix, `movw $0x0A, %ax` loads `%ax` with the value `$0x0a`.

{ Assemblers for x86

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/as[gas]
 
  nasm

  yasm (which apperently is modelled after nasm)

  HLA: *High Level Assembler*, uses a high level language like syntax for declarations of functions and procedure calls and allows for control structures (`if`, `while` …).
  -
  As high level assembler, it requires a (real) low level assembler such as `as` or `masm`.

}
{ First instruction of an x86 #x86-first-instruction

  An x86 begins execution with the instruction stored in  `ffff:fff0`, aka *reset vector*.

  Apparently, there is a jump to the → hardware/BIOS[BIOS] start routine:
code {
ljmp $0xf000, $0xe05b         ;  or $0xffff ????
code }
