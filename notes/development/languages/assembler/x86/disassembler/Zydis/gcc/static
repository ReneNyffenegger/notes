$ Static compilation of Zydis with gcc

In order to statically compile Zydis, the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[preprocessor macros] `ZYCORE_STATIC_DEFINE` and `ZYDIS_STATIC_DEFINE` must be defined.

{ Makefile

  The following make file statically compiles and links a test program:
  gh|Zydis-test|/Makefile||

}
{ test.c 

 `test.c` is the test program to create an executable (which I took from Zydis' → https://github.com/zyantific/zydis[github respository] («Quick Example»).

  gh|Zydis-test|/test.c||

}
