sed: cycles and data buffers

→ development/languages/sed maintains two *data buffers*: the → #pattern-space[pattern space] and the → #hold-space[hold space].

Execution of a sed program
  • When sed is started, it initializes the these buffers with «empty» content.
  • Then sed iterates over each input line. Each new input line starts a *cycle*.
  • During a cycle, all commands in the script whose addresses match the current input line are executed
  • After executing all commands in the script, the content of the  *pattern space* is printed is printed to STDOUT (unless the command line option `-n` was given)
  • The pattern space (but not the hold space) is emptied and the next input line is read, which starts the next cycle

Some commands (or at least one command: `D`) might start a new cycle without reading a line from STDIN.



{ Pattern space #pattern-space


}

{ Hold space #hold-space

}
