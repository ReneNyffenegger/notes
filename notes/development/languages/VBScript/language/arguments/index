$ VBScript: arguments

{ Iterate over arguments

  The following simple script iterates over each argument given to a (console) VBScript script:

  gh|about-VBScript|/language/arguments/iterate.vbs||

  It might be invoked such as
code {
c:\> cscript iterate.vbs hello world etc.
code }

  Note, if a named argument is used (`/val=42`), this counts as one argument.

}
{ Checking for named arguments

  The following script checks which of the named arguments `foo`, `bar` and `baz` is given to a script.

  Named arguemnts have the form `/argName:value`.

  In order to explicitly give no value, `/argName:` might be used.
