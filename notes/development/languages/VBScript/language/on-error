$ VBSCript: on error …

VBScript has to statements that influence *error handling*:
  • `on error goto 0`
  • `on error resume next`

If `on error goto 0` is in effect, a runtime error causes the application to terminate and print an error message. This is the default behaviour.

Setting `on error resume next` does not stop a program when a runtime error occurs. In order to detect errors, the `err` object needs to be queried after each statement that is supsected to cause a runtime error.
