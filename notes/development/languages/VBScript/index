VBScript programs are executed within a *host environment* such as → development/languages/WSH[Windows Script Host], Internet Explorer or Internet Information Services.

{ Datatypes

  VBScript only has *one* datatype: the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant.

}
{ Statements

  • `call`
  • `dim`, → development/languages/VBScript/language/const[`const`], `public` and `private` to declare variables.
  • `do … loop`, → development/languages/VBScript/language/for/to[`for … next`] and `while … wend`
  • `erase`
  • → development/languages/VBScript/language/for-each[`for each … next`]
  • `function … end function` and `sub … end sub`
  • → development/languages/VBScript/language/if[`if … then … elseIf … else … end if`]
  • `on error`
  • → development/languages/VBScript/language/option-explicit[`option explicit`]
  • `randomize` to initialize the random number generator (I am sort of impressed)
  • `redim` to change the size of an array
  • `set`

}
{ Objects

  • Dictionary (Compare with → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Scripting-Runtime/dictionary[dictionary of Microsoft Scripting Runtime])
  • Drive and Drives
  • File and Files
  • Folder and Folders
  • FileSystemObjects (See → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Scripting-Runtime/fileSystemObject[`Scripting.FileSystemObject`])
  • TextStream
  • Err

}
{ Comparison to VBA

  VBScript is not → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications].

  VBA is a richer language than VBScript and comes with a somewhat more sophisticated development environment.

  VBA is included with → Microsoft/Office[Microsoft Office] and allows to create complete applications with those products.

  VBScript, on the other hand, is not primarly aimed at developing applications, but rather to quickly script something.

}
{ TODO

  Apparently, VBScripts are embeddebale in other programs using *Microsoft Script Control* (`msscript.ocx`).

}

sa:

  → development/languages/VBScript/language/arguments[arguments]

  Other → development/languages[programming languages] etc.

  Allegedly, VBScript script files cannot start with a → development/Unicode/BOM[BOM].
