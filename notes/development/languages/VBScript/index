{ Comparison to VBA

  VBScript is not → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications].

  VBA is a richer language than VBScript and comes with a somewhot more sophisticated development environment.

  VBA is included with → Microsoft/Office[Microsoft Office] and allows to create complete applications with those products.

  VBScript, on the other hand, is not primarly aimed at developing applications, but rather to quickly script something.
