$ VBScript: measure elapsed time

The following simple script tries to demonstrate how it is possible to measure the elapsed time in → development/languages/VBScript.

gh|about-VBScript|/examples/measure-elapsed-time.vbs||

Note: → development/languages/VBScript/language/functions/_date-time-related/timer[`timer`] returns the number of seconds since the most recent midnight.
Thus, if the script ends not on the same day that it is started, the reported number of seconds will be wrong.
