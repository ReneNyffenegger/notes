{ Getting information about available datasets

  The datasets of currently loaded → development/languages/R/package[packages] are returned with → development/languages/R/functions/data[`data()`].

  The datasets of all installed (but not necessarily loaded) packages is returned with `data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))`.

  The datasets for a particular package can be queried with `data(package = '→ development/languages/R/packages/ggplot2[ggplot2]')`.
