$ R: Supported data files

R supports four data file formats:
  • → development/filename-extensions#r[.R] or .r: they are → development/languages/R/functions/source[source'd].
  • → development/filename-extensions#rda[.rda] / → development/filename-extensions#rdata[.RData]: they are → development/languages/R/functions/load[load'ed]
  • .tab, .txt and .TXT files: they are read using → development/languages/R/functions/read_table[read.table], thus becoming *data frames*.
  • .csv and .CSV files: they are read using → development/languages/R/functions/read_table[read.table(…, sep=";")], also becoming *data frames*.
