$ R package: rgdal 

Building rgdal unter Mint, → Linux/distributions/Ubuntu/ or another → Linux/distributions/Debian based system requires the *libgdal* libraries to be installed on the system. If they are not, the building
process will say that it didn't find `proj_api.h` or something.
-
These libraries can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libgdal1-dev libproj-dev`.
