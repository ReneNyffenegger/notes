$ R: factors
@ factor

A *factor* is R's name for a *categorical variable*.

{ Level #r-factor-level

  The distinct values in a factor are called *levels*.

  The → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr#r-dplyr-count-levels[levels might be counted] with → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr[`dplyr`'s] function `count`.

}
{ Attributes of a factor

  A *factor* has two specific → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attributes]:
    • class = factor
    • levels

  gh|about-r|/data-structures/factor/attributes.R||

}
{ Internally stored as numericals

  Factors are internally stored as numericals, which can be revealed by applying → development/languages/R/functions/as_numeric[`as.numeric`]
  or → development/languages/R/functions/as/integer#r-as-integer-factor[`as.integer(…)`] on a factor:
  gh|about-r|/data-structures/factor/numeric.R||

  In unordered factors (as is the case in the last code snippet), the numbers are assigned in alphabetical order.

}
{ Creating ordered factors

  An ordered factor can be created by using `ordered=TRUE` when `factor()` is called. In this case, the variables class attribute will be
  both `factor` and `ordered`.

  Note, that `days` does not have `'Wed'` but we specify it as a factor in the call to `factor`. Using
  → development/languages/R/functions/table[`table(…)`] shows the count of each factor, even if not being assigned:

  gh|about-r|/data-structures/factor/ordered.R||

}
{ Omit 'Levels' when printing

  When a factor is printed, by default, its levels are also displayed in a separate line.

  In order to omit this line and only print the factor's elements, one of the → development/languages/R/functions[`as.XYZ()`] functions might be used:
  gh|about-r|/data-structures/factor/print-omit-Levels.R||

}

sa:

  The functions
  Functions → development/languages/R/functions/factor[`factor(…)`],
  Functions → development/languages/R/functions/levels[`levels(…)`] and
  Functions → development/languages/R/functions/gl[`gl(…)`].

  An → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[(atomic) vector] can be turned into a factor with → development/languages/R/functions/as/factor[`as.factor(…)`].
