$ R: lists
@ list

Lists can be created using → development/languages/R/functions/list[`list()`]

{ Heterogeneous

  Lists can contain elements of differing type, that is: they have different → development/languages/R/object/mode[modes].

  Thus, lists are also referred as *generic vectors* (rather than → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[atomic vectors] which are homogeneous).

}
{ Data frames

  A → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame] is a list whose elements are → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors] or factors. These vectors/factors (obviously) have the
  same length. They correspond to columns of a table. Each element (= column) has a name.

}
{ Indexing

  Elements in a list can be accessed by three different indexing operations.

}
{ Iterating over elements in a list

  → development/languages/R/functions/_apply[The apply function family] is → development/languages/R[R's] preferred way to call a
  → development/languages/R/function[function] on each element of a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector or a list.

}

sa:
  → development/languages/R/functions/unlist[`unlist(…)`] to turn a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] into a list.
