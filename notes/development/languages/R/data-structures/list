$ R: lists

Lists are created using → development/languages/R/functions/list()


{ Heterogeneous

  Lists can contain elements of differing type, that is: they have different → development/languages/R/object/mode[modes].
  -
  In contrast, → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors] are homogeneous.

}
{ Data frames

  A *data frame* is a list whose elements are → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors] or factors. These vectors/factors (obviously) have the
  same length. They correspond to columns of a table. Each element (= column) has a name.
