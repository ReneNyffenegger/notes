$ R data structures

All → development/languages/R/object[R objects] are built upon the native data structures:
  • → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector]
  • → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrix
  • → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list]
  • → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame]
  • → development/languages/R/data-structures/array[array]

Which data structure should be used depends on the data's dimensionality and if it consists of a single data type or multiple data types:
table { lll

  ~Dimensions~ ☰ Single data type ☰ Multiple data types
  1            ☰ (Atomic) → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] ☰ → development/languages/R/data-structures/list
  2            ☰ → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrix ☰ → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame]
  3 or more    ☰ → development/languages/R/data-structures/array            ☰ n/a

table }
  Note: the matrix is just a special case of an array. In fact, the array and matrix are just special cases of an atomic vector.

sa:
  The → development/languages/R/packages/lobstr[`lobstr` package] has a set of tools for inspecting and understanding R data structures.
