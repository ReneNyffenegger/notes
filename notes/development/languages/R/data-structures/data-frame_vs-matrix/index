{ Conversion from data frame to matrix

  Because a → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame] might contain different
  data types but a → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrices[matrix] is constrained to a single data type, the conversion from a data frame to a matrix coerces all values of the data frame to the same data type in the matrix.
