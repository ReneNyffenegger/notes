$ R: data frames vs matrices
@ Data frames vs matrices

The following few R statements try to point out some differences between 
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frames] and
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrix[matrices].
The script creates a data frame (`df`) and a matrix (`mx`) both of which have the same dimensions (3 columns times 2 rows) and the same data.

First, → development/languages/R/functions/identical[`identical(df, mx)`] tells us that `df` is different from `mx`.

Then, the objects' → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attributes] are determined with the respective function
→ development/languages/R/functions/attributes[`attributes()`]. It turns out that the data frame has the three attributes `names`, `class` and `row.names` while the
matrix has only the single attribute `dim`.

Finally, applying → development/languages/R/functions/length[`length()`] on the objects returns 3 for the data frame, reflecting the three columns, and 6 for the matrix, reflecting the number
of elements in the matrix.

{ Conversion from data frame to matrix

  Because a → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame] might contain different
  data types but a → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrix is constrained to a single data type, the conversion from a data frame to a matrix coerces all values of the data frame to the same data type in the matrix.
