$ R: vectors
@ vector

*Vectors* are probably *the* most fundamental → development/languages/R/data-structures[data structure] in the → development/languages/R[R programming language].

There are two types of vectors:
  • Atomic or basic vectors
  • (Generic) → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[lists])

Atocmic vectors are constructed with the → development/languages/R/functions/c[`c` function] or the
→ development/languages/R/functions/vector[`vector` function].

A vector is different from a one-dimensional array: the array has a `dim` → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attribute] of length one while a vector has no such attribute.

{ Fundamental vector types

  R has six basic (»atomic«) vector types:
  table { lll

    → development/languages/R/functions/typeof[`typeof(…)`] ☰ → development/languages/R/functions/mode[`mode(…)`] ☰ `storage.mode(…)`
    logical   ☰ logical   ☰ logical
    integer   ☰ numeric   ☰ integer
    double    ☰ numeric   ☰ double
    complex   ☰ complex   ☰ complex
    character ☰ character ☰ character
    raw       ☰ raw       ☰ raw

  table }

}
{ Homogeneous

  All elements within a vector share the same type, that is: they have the same → development/languages/R/object/mode[mode]
  In contrast, → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[lists] are heterogeneous.

}
{ Creating vectors

  For example with
    • → development/languages/R/functions/c[`c(…)`]
    • → development/languages/R/functions/seq[`seq(…)`]
    • …

}
{ 1-indexed

  The first element of a vector has index `1`:
code {
elems <- c('one', 'two', 'three')
elems[1] # one
code }

}
{ Iterating over vectors

  For example with
    • → development/languages/R/functions/sapply[`sapply`]
    • …
}
{ Comparing vectors

}
{ Selecting elements

  gh|about-r|/vector/selecting_elements.R||

}
{ Names property

  Vectors can have the *names* property which names each element within the vector.

  gh|about-r|/vector/names_property.R||

}
{ Visualizing vectors

  A simple method to visualize the values in a vector is to use → development/languages/R/functions/barplot[`barplot`].

}

sa:

  Vectors can be created with → development/languages/R/functions/seq[`seq(…)`].

  → development/languages/R/functions/unlist[`unlist(…)`] to turn a vector into a → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list].

  → development/languages/R/functions/is_vector

  The indices of a *logical vector* that are `TRUE` are returned by the function → development/languages/R/functions/which[`which()`].
  -
  → development/languages/R/functions/match[`match(…)`] returns the index of the *first* element in a vector that matches a specific value.

  → development/languages/R/functions/Vectorize[`Vectorize(…)`].
