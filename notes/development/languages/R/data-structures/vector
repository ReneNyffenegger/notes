$ R: vectors
@ vector

*Vectors* are probably *the* most fundamental → development/languages/R/data-structures[data structure] in the → development/languages/R[R programming language].

There are two types of vectors:
  • atomic
  • lists (TODO: what is the correlation with → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[lists])

Vectors are constructed with the → development/languages/R/functions/c[`c` function] or the
→ development/languages/R/functions/vector[`vector` function].

{ Homogeneous

  All elements within a vector share the same type, that is: they have the same → development/languages/R/object/mode[mode]
  In contrast, → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[lists] are heterogeneous.

{ Names property

  Vectors can have the *names* property which names each element within the vector.
