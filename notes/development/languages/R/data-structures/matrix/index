  Matrix inverse: → development/languages/R/functions/solve[`solve()`]

  Matrix multiplication: `m1 %*% m2` (`m1 * m2` is an element wise operation).

  Compare with the → development/languages/R/classes/matrix[matrix class].

 { Converting a vector to a matrix and vice versa

    This is an old example that should be polished, somehow …
