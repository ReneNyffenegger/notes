$ R: data frames

A *data frame* is the R correspondant → Companies-Products/SAS/data-sources/data-set[SAS (or SPSS) data sets].

A data frame is stored as a → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list] of → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors], *factors* and/or
→ development/languages/R/classes/matrix[matrices] each of which has the same length.


{ Dimensions

  The dimensions of a data frame can be queried with → development/languages/R/functions/nrow[`nrow()`] and
  → development/languages/R/functions/length[`length()`].
  -
  `nrow()` returns the number of observations (or rows or records).
  -
  `length()` returns the number of columns.

{ Class, type and mode

  A *data.frame's* → development/languages/R/object/class[class] is `data.frame`; → development/languages/R/functions/typeof[`typeof()`] and
  → development/languages/R/functions/mode[`mode()`] return → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[`list`].

{ Functions to create data frames

  Some functions to create data frames and values to it are (TO BE COMPLETED):
    • → development/languages/R/functions/read_csv[`read.csv()`] to read a → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV[CSV] file into a data frame
    • → development/languages/R/functions/read_csv#r-read_csv-text[`read.csv(…, text = "")`] to assign data that is stored *within* an R source/script file
    • …

}

sa:

  → development/languages/R/functions/data_frame[`data.frame(…)`],
  → development/languages/R/functions/read/table[`read.table(…)`]

  → development/languages/R/packages/tidyverse#tidyverse-tibble[Tibbles] are data frames that are tweaked to work better in the tidyverse.

  → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr[dplyr] provides → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr#dplyr-sql-like[SQL like access to data frames].

  The package → development/languages/R/packages/sqldf[`sqldf`] allows to manipulate data frames with → development/databases/SQL[SQL].

  The data or content stored in a dataframe might be visually inspected with the
  → development/languages/R/functions/View[`View()`] or → development/languages/R/packages/DT#r-DT-datatable[`DT::datatable()`] functions.
