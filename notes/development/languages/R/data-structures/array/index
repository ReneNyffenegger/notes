@ array

An *array* is one of the fundamental → development/languages/R/data-structures[data structures] of → development/languages/R[R].

{ An array is a vector

  An *array* is a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] (atomic or → development/languages/R/data-structures/list) that has the → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attribute] `dim`. This attribute is itself an
 (integer) → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] that specifies the dimensions of the the array. Thus, the length of the `dim` vector also defines the number
  of dimensions of the vector.

}
{ Optional attribute dimnames

  An array can also be assigned the optional attribute `dimnames`

}
{ Two-dimensional arrays

  Two-dimensional arrays are also → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrix[matrices].

}
sa:
  → development/languages/R/functions/is/array[`is.array(obj)`] tests if `obj` is an array.
