$ R package: xlsx

The xlsx package allows to read and write → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] files.

{ read.xlsx

  Unfortunately, there seems to be no `stringsAsFactor` parameter.

{ Crashing RGui.exe

  When I tried to execute `→ development/languages/R/functions/library[library](xlsx)`, my RGui session crashed.

  This was apparently caused by a wrong version of the JDK. I had to fix the `JAVA_HOME` → development/environment-variable[environment variable] to get it running:
code {
Sys.setenv('JAVA_HOME' = "C:\\Program Files\\sqldeveloper\\jdk\\jre")
code }


}

sa:
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel

  → development/languages/R/packages
