$ R package: tidyr

{ Tidy data #tidyr-tidy-data

  Tidy data (as understood and used in the → development/languages/R/packages/tidyverse[tidyverse]):
    • Each variable in a column
    • Each observation in a row
    • Each value is a cell

   The concept of tidy data is related to that of a relational → development/databases[database] (and by extension to Codd's *relational algebra*). The properties
   of tidy data are perfectly accomodated by R because of its vectorized programming paradigm.

  *Tidy data* was popularized by *Hadley Wickham* (see → http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper[his paper]).

  `tidyr` aims at helping to create *tidy data*.

{ Normalize data with spread()

  → development/languages/R/packages/tidyr/spread[`spread()`] can be used to *normalize* data (that is: to create a *pivot*, aka tidy data):

  gh|about-r|/packages/tidyr/spread.R||

}
{ Un-pivot data with gather() #r-tidyr-gather

 `gather()` un-pivots data:
  gh|about-r|/packages/tidyr/gather.R||

}


sa:
  `tidyr` is part of the → development/languages/R/packages/tidyverse[tidyverse].

  `tidyr` replaces `reshape` and `reshape2`.
