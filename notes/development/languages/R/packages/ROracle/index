$ R package: ROracle

`ROracle` is the Oracle dependent → development/languages/R/packages/DBI#r-dbi-backend[DBI backend] - 
it allows to natively connect to an → development/databases/Oracle database from → development/languages/R.

It is claimed to be up to 48 times faster than RJDBS and up to 11 times faster than → development/languages/R/packages/RODBC[RODBC].

{ Installing

  { R 3.3

  I was able to install the package on → Windows/versions/10[Windows 10] and R Version 3.3 by downloading the ROracle zip file from OTN and then executing the following
  commands in an R session.
code {
setwd('C:\\Users\\Rene\\Downloads')
install.packages('ROracle_1.3-1.zip', repos = NULL)
code }

  As usual, an → https://stackoverflow.com/a/32086511/180275[answer on StackOverflow] was very helpful.

  }
  { R 3.6

    The zip file for R 3.6 (ROracle-1.3.2.zip) didn't contain a directory named `ROracle`.
    
    So, I had to extract the zip file first, create `ROracle`, move the extracted files into `ROracle` and
    then create a zip file again.

    With that zip file, I could install ROracle.

  }

}
{ Testing the installation

code {
library(ROracle)
drv <- dbDriver ('Oracle')
con <- dbConnect( drv, 'rene', 'mySecretPassword', dbname = 'ora18')

dbReadTable(con, 'DUAL') # Note, table/view name seems to be case sensitive here.
code }

}
