$ R package: nominatim

The `nominatim` package is an interface to the → development/OpenStreetMap/Nominatim[Open Street Map API nominatim].

{ Installing

  It seems that `nominatim` cannot be installed with the traditional → development/languages/R/functions/install_packages[`install.packages(…)`]. At least on my machine, it caused a
  *package 'nominatim' is not available (for R version 3.3.3)*.
  
  However, I was able to install it with
code {
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/nominatim")
code }

}
{ API Key

  To access the → development/OpenStreetMap[OpenStreetMap] API, a key is required. Without such a key, the error
 *Please provide a openstreet API key* is thrown.

  The key available from → https://developer.mapquest.com[developer.mapquest.com].
