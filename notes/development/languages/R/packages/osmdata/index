$ R package: osmdata

{ Installation

  In `RGui.exe`, I had to explicitely choose a different mirror with → development/languages/R/functions/chooseCRANmirror[`chooseCRANmirror()`] before installing the package with
code {
install.packages('osmdata')
code }

}

sa:

  R package → development/languages/R/packages/OpenStreetMap[`OpenStreetMap`]

  → development/OpenStreetMap

  → development/languages/R/packages
