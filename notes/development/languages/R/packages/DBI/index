$ R package: DBI

The `DBI` package defines a generic → development/databases[database] interface for R.

{ DBI Backends #r-dbi-backend

  The actual database dependent implementation is implemented by so called *DBI backends*, some of which start with `R`
  (for example → development/languages/R/packages/RMySQL[`RMySQL`] or
  → development/languages/R/packages/ROracle[`ROracle`]).

  A backend needs to define three classes which are subclasses of
    • `DBIDriver`
    • `DBIConnection`
    • `DBIResult`
 
}
