*Topographic Information on Auckland's Maunga Whau Volcano*: the data set gives the height of the volcano in a 10 x 10 meter grid.

{ volcano is a matrix

  The dataset `volcano` is a → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrix with 61 columns and 87 rows that stores doubles:

{ Plotting the volcano with rgl

  The data of the volcano might be plotted with the → development/languages/R/packages/rgl[`rgl` package].

  2019-08-28: When I initially wrote the script, I used `rgl.open()`, `rgl.bg()`, `rgl.surface()` and `rgl.bringtotop()`. At that time, I didn't know that these are low level functions and should not be used, if possible.
  I now replaced them with the `open3d()` and `surface3d()` which produce the same result (yet I had to change the values in the matrix in the call of `view3d`).

  The `rgl.…` functions are commented, for remembering purposes.
