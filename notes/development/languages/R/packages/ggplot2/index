$ R package: ggplot2

The ggplot2 package features a graphic paradigm which is called the »grammar of graphics«.

The package was created by Hadley Wickham, the author of »ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis« (Springer 2009).

ggplot2 is one of the core members of → development/languages/R/packages/tidyverse[tidyverse].

{ ggplot()

  In ggplot2, a plot is started with the function `ggplot(data = ds)`. The `data` argument specifies the → development/languages/R/datasets[dataset] to use in the graph.

  This function creates a coordinate system on which layers can be added. Apparently, these layers are added with the `+` operator.

}
{ geom_…()

  A `geom_…()` function takes a `mapping` argument whose value is returned by `aes(x = …, y= …)`.
