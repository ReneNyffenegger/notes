$ R package: dplyr

{ SQL like access #dplyr-sql-like

  The arguably six most important functions of *dplyr* provide → development/databases/SQL[SQL like] access to → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[dataframes].
  These functions are
    • `filter()` to select observations by their values
    • `arrange()` to reorder rows
    • `mutate()` to create new variables with functions of existing values
    • `summarise()` to create summaries of values
    • `select()` to select variables by their names
    • `group_by()`

  The first argument in these functions is always a → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame] and these functions return a (new) data frame.
