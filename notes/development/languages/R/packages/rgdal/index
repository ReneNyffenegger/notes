{ Reading shape files #rgdal-readOGR

  `rgdal's` function `readOGR()` can be used to read → development/data-formats/Shape-file[shape files].

  `readOGR` accepts two arguments: `dsn` (data source name, a name of a directory) and `layer` (the shape file's name without `.shp`, `.dbf` suffix).

code {
library(rgdal)
shp <- readOGR(dsn = '.', layer = 'geo')

shp@proj4string                                                     # content of .prj file?

{ Misc


  Building rgdal unter Mint, → Linux/distributions/Ubuntu/ or another → Linux/distributions/Debian based system requires the *libgdal* libraries to be installed on the system. If they are not, the building
  process will say that it didn't find `proj_api.h` or something.
  -
  These libraries can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libgdal1-dev libproj-dev`.
