$ R: apply function family

The *apply function family* is → development/languages/R[R's] preferred way to call a → development/languages/R/function[function] on each element of a
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] or a
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list].

→ development/languages/R/functions/apply[`apply(…)`]

→ development/languages/R/functions/lapply[`lapply(…)`] which is moslty equal to `sapply` except that it returns a → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list] rather than
a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector],
-
Apparently, the `l` stands for list.

→ development/languages/R/functions/mapply[`mapply(…)`],

→ development/languages/R/functions/sapply[`sapply(…)`] allows to apply a function on each element of a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector]. Apparently, the `s` stands for simplify.

→ development/languages/R/functions/rapply[`rapply(…)`],

→ development/languages/R/functions/tapply[`tapply(…)`]

sa:
  → development/languages/R/functions
