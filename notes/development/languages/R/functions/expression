$ R function: expression

{ Capturing an expression

 `expression(…)` captures the expression within the paranthesis without evaluating it.

  When the (returned) expression value is printed, the captured expression is still there:

  gh|about-R|/functions/expression/print.R||

}
{ Evaluating an expression

  An expression can then be → development/languages/R/functions/eval[evaluated]:

  gh|about-R|/functions/expression/eval.R||

}

sa:

  The R function → development/languages/R/functions/parse[`parse()`]

  The → development/languages/R/object/mode/expression[expression mode].

  → development/languages/R/functions
