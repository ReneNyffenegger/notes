$ R functions probabilty distributions

{ Root name #r-distr-root-name

  R has a root-name for → science/mathematics/probability/distributions[probability distributions]. For example, for the
  → science/mathematics/probability/distributions#ditribution-normal[normal distribution], the root name is `norm`.
  -
  R then defined 4 → development/languages/R/functions[functions] for each of these root names by prepending them
  with `d` (density), `p` (distribution function), `q` (quantile function) and `r` (generate random deviates).

}

{ Random numbers #random-numbers

  Four uniform variates between 3 and 7: `→ development/languages/R/functions/runif[runif](4, min=3, max=7)`

  Two standard normal variates with a *mean* of 42 and a *standard deviation* of 9: `→ development/languages/R/functions/rnorm[rnorm](2, mean=42, sd=9)`.

  A binomial variate: `→ development/languages/R/functions/rbinom[rbinom](1, size=6, prob=0.333)`

  Five poisson variate: `→ development/languages/R/functions/rpois[rpois](5, lambda=8)`

  Nine gamma variates: `→ development/languages/R/functions/rgamma[rgamma](9, shape=4, rate=0.333)`
