$ R function: Encoding

The following example assigns the bytes needed to encode *René* in latin-1 to the variable `name`. When `name` is → development/languages/R/functions/print[printed], R assumes
that `name` is encoded in → development/Unicode/UTF-8[UTF-8]. Thus, the name is printed with a »wrong« character.
-
With `Encoding(name)`, the correct encoding is assigned to the string which causes it to be printed correctly.
