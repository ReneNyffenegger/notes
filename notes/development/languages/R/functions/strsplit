$ R function: strsplit

gh|about-r|/functions/strsplit/simple.R||

{ Returning a list

 `strsplit` returns a → development/languages/R/data-structures/list, not a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector:
  gh|about-r|/functions/strsplit/list.R||

  The reason that `strsplit` returns a list is that a vector of strings can be passed as first argument and still be distinguished in the returned list:

}
{ Regular expression patterns

  Unless the parameter `fixed` is set to `TRUE` (the default being `FALSE`) , the second parameter is a → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] which is used to split the string:
