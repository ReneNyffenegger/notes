$ R function: mapply

`mapply(func, vec₁, vec₂, … vecش)` calls the given function n times. In the mth invocation, the arguments of `func` are set to the mth element of the → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] `vecₘ`.

In the following example, a function is defined that takes three arguments. Then, `mapply` is invoked. It is passed the function plus vectors. `mapply` will then call the function with the argumments `(1, 1, 5)`, `(4, 2, 0)`, `(0, 3, 4)` and `(6, 0, 3)`:
