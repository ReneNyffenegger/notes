$ R function: which
@ which

`which(logical_vector)` returns the indices of a logical → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] that are true:
gh|about-r|/functions/which/indices-of-true.R||

{ Find the longes names

  The folllowing *contrived* example finds the longes character-string in a vector:

  gh|about-r|/functions/which/which.R||
  
}

sa:

  → development/languages/R/functions/which_min[`which.min(…)`],
  → development/languages/R/functions/which_max[`whcih.max(…)`]

  → development/languages/R/functions/match[`match(…)`] returns the index of the first element in a vector that matches a value.

  → development/languages/R/functions
