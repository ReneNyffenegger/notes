$ R function: tapply

`tapply(elems, group_index, fun… )`

`tapply` first partitions the elements of `elems` according to the indices in `group_index`, *then* applies function `fun` on each group's elements.

The following example defines items with that each have a color and a size. With `tapply`, the average (→ development/languages/R/functions/mean[`mean`]) size
for each group is calculated and returned:
gh|about-r|/functions/tapply.R||

In → development/databases/SQL[SQL], this example would roughly correspond to the following statement. (Never mind the fact that
SQL apparently does → development/databases/SQL/select/analytic/percentile/disc[not define a `mean` aggregate function]).
code {
select
   color,
   mean(size)
from
   df
group by
   color;
code }

{ Misc

  The `t` in `tapply` stands for → development/languages/R/functions/table[`table`].
