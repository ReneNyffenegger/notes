$ R functions for graphics

{ High-level graph functions

  *High-level* graph functions open a new graph by initializing a new window.

  Some of such high level graph functions are;
    • → development/languages/R/functions/plot
    • → development/languages/R/functions/boxplot
    • → development/languages/R/functions/hist
    • → development/languages/R/functions/curve
    • → development/languages/R/functions/persp

}
{ Low-level graph functions

  *Low-level* graph functions do not start a new graph. They're used to amend existing graphs (that previously were started with one of the high level graph functions).

  Some of such low level graph functions are
    • → development/languages/R/functions/points
    • → development/languages/R/functions/lines
    • → development/languages/R/functions/abline
    • → development/languages/R/functions/segments
    • → development/languages/R/functions/polygon
    • → development/languages/R/functions/text
    • → development/languages/R/functions/barplot (?)
    • → development/languages/R/functions/grid (?)
