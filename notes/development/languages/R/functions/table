$ R function: table

gh|about-r|/functions/table.R||

{ Count frequency of a vector #r-table-count-frequency

 `table` applied on a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] counts the frequencies of its elements

  gh|about-r|/functions/table/frequency.R||

}
{ Contigency table #r-table-contigency-tables

  If two vectors are passed to the `table` function, it returns a → science/mathematics/statistics/contingency-table[contingency table] (aka cross tabulation)

  gh|about-r|/functions/table/contigency.R||

}
{ N-Way contigency table

  It is also possible to create a *three-way contigency table (or more generally, an n-way contigency table):

  gh|about-r|/functions/table/3-way-contingency-table.R||

}

sa:

  `table` can be used to count the → development/languages/R/functions/barplot#r-barplot-table[occurence of the different elements] in a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector].

  `table` is the generic form of → development/languages/R/functions/tapply[`tapply`].

  The underlying function for `table` is → development/languages/R/functions/tabulate[`tabulate`].

  → development/languages/R/functions/ftable[`ftable`]

  → development/languages/R/functions
