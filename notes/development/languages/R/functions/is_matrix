$ R function: is.matrix

`is.matrix(obj)` returns true if `obj` is a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] and has
a `dim` → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attribute] whose length is 2:
gh|about-r|/functions/is/matrix/two-dimensional.R||


An object that is created with → development/languages/R/functions/matrix[`matrix`] is, of course, a matrix:
gh|about-r|/functions/is.matrix.R||
