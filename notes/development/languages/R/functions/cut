$ R function: cut

`cut` assigns each element to a »bin«. The sizes (start and end values) of each bin is indicated with the second argument.

In the following example, the → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] `v` containes elements between 2 and 19.
-
Each of these elements is assigned a bin, the first of which spans 0…5, the second of which spans 5…10 etc (according to the second parameter).
-
The returned value (`c`) is a vector of equal length like `v` that contains the bin for each element. The first element (8) falls between `(5,10]`, the
second element (13) falls between `(10,15]`:
