$ R: generate uniform randum numbers with runif(…)

`runif` can be used to produce random numbers; `runif` does *not* stand for *run if*.

`runif(n)` generates `n` uniform random numbers between 0 and 1.
-
`runif(n, a, b)` generates `n` uniform random numbers between `a` and `b`.

In order to create the same random numbers, → development/languages/R/functions/set_seed[`set.seed(…)`] can be used.

{ Example

  The following example first creates 10 random numbers in the interval 1 … 10 and assigns it to the variable `r` and evaluates `r` to print its values.
  
  Then, it creates another 1000 random variables and uses → development/languages/R/functions/plot[`plot(…)`] and
  → development/languages/R/functions/hist[`hist(…)`] to demonstrate that the distrribution of `runif` is (more or less) uniform:
  
  gh|about-r|/functions/runif.R||
  
  This is the plot:
  gh|about-r|/functions/images/runif/plot.png||
  
  This is the → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/histogram[historgram];
  gh|about-r|/functions/images/runif/hist.png||
