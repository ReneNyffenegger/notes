$ R function: read.csv

`read.csv()` is a wrapper function for → development/languages/R/functions/read_table[`read.table()`] that mandates a comma as seperator and uses the input file's first line as header that specifies
the table's column names. Thus, it is an ideal candidate to read → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV files.
