{ Iterating over an ascending sequence of integers

  Iterating over an ascending sequence of integers is particularly simple with a combination of `for` and → development/languages/R/operators#r-operators-colon[colon operator].

  With `for`, it's (of course) also possible to iterate over a character → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector].

{ Skipping iteration for specific elements with next

 `next` can be used to skip (or jump out of) an iteration:

{ Iterating over a data frame #r-for-iterate-data-frame

  If `for()` is used to iterate over a → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame] (`for (col in df)) …`), in each iteration, `col`
  is set to the vectors that make up the columns in the data frame.
