$ R function: nchar

`nchar` returns the length of a string or lenghs of a string vector.

Other → development/languages[programming languages] might call the respective functionality `strlen` or `len` or similar.

In earlier versions of R, `nchar(NA)` apparently returned 2. This behavior can be turned on again with `keepNA=F`.

A particular useful application of `nchar` is to see if a string is empty.
