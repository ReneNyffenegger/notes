$ R: polymorphic functions

In R, some functions are polymorphic. That means, their behavior is dependent on the type of the argument fed to the function.

An example of a polymorphic function is → development/languages/R/functions/plot[`plot`]: it produces a different graph if it is given a
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector], a → development/languages/R/data-structures/factor[factor], → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame], a linear regression model,
a table etc.
