$ R function: plot
@ plot

`plot` is a *polymorph* function: it changes its behavior depending the → development/languages/R/object/class[class] (or type) of its first argument.

{ One (numeric) vector

 `plot(x)` creates a → development/Data/visualization/Scatter-plot[scatter plot] if `x` is a numeric vector. The values of `x` are plotted against their index in its vector

  The following example uses `type='l'` to connect the points of the scatter plots with lines.

}
{ Two (numeric) vectors - scatter plot #r-plot-scatter

  `plot(x, y)` produces a → development/Data/visualization/Scatter-plot[scatter plot] if `x` and `y` are
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors]

}
{ Factors #r-plot-factor

  If the class of the plotted variable is a → development/languages/R/data-structures/factor[factor], a
  → development/Data/visualization/Bar-chart[bar chart] is produced.

  In the following example, the heights of the bars correspond to the counts of occurences of a value in `f`:

}
{ Data frames

  If a → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame is plotted, each vaiable of the data frame is plotted against each other.

{ Overlaying plots

  A plot can be laid over another plot by setting the `arg` argument to `TRUE`:
code {
plot(thing_one)
plot(thing_two, add = TRUE)
code }

}
{ Plotting a subset of a data frame #r-plot-with

  The → development/languages/R/functions/with[`with(…)`] function allows to → development/languages/R/functions/plot[plot] a specific subset of a
  → development/languages/R/functions/data_frame[data frame].
  -
  In the following example, only the values for `item == 'baz'` are plotted:

}
{ Maximizing size of plot

  In order to maximize the size of the plot itself, the margins might be set to zero (before calling `plot(…)`):
code {
→ development/languages/R/functions/par[par](mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(…)
code }
