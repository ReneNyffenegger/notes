$ R function: seq

{ by=4

  Create a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector], starting with 20, incrementing *by* 4, with greatest element not greater than 41:
  gh|about-r|/functions/seq/by.R||

}
{ length=4

  Create exactly 4 elements between 10 and 26, inclusively:
  gh|about-r|/functions/seq/length.R||

}
{ Creating a sequence of dates

  When starting with a »date« value such as created by → development/languages/R/functions/ISOdate[`ISODate(…)`], `seq` creates a vector of dates.

  The `by` parameter then understands durations such as `week`:

}
{ Using seq to plot an x/y function

  First `seq(…)` is used to fill x values to a vector (named `x`). Then, a vector, named `y`, is filled by calling a function.
  
  Finally, x and y are ploted;
