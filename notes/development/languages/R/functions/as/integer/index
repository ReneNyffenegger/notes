$ R function: as.integer

{ Converting a numerical (double) into an integer

  Number literals that look like integers (for example `4`) are internally stored as doubles. `as.integer()` converts them to integers.
  
  If a number literal is suffixed with an `L`, its type is `integer`:

{ Applying as.integer on a factor #r-as-integer-factor

  → development/languages/R/data-structures/factor[Factors] are internally stored as a
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] of integers. Applying `as.integer(…)` on a
  factor displays these integers:
