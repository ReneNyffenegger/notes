$ R function: barplot

{ Visualize the values of a vector

  In its simplest form, `barplot` can be used to visualize the values in a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector].

{ Counting occurence of elements #r-barplot-table

  The elements in a vector can be counted with → development/languages/R/functions/table[`table`] and the bar-plotted which reveals how often a specific element (string) occurs in the vector:

}
{ Naming (labeling) bars #r-barplot-names

  With → development/languages/R/functions/names[`names`], the elements in a vector can be given a name which will then be displayed below the bars in the plot:
