`is.vector(obj)` returns true of if the tested → development/languages/R/object[object] (`obj`) is a vector or expression that has either no
→ development/languages/R/object/attributes[attributes] or only the `names` attribute set.

In order to check if an object is an → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[atomic vector], → development/languages/R/functions/is_atomic[`is.atomic()`] should be used.
To test if the object is a → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list], → development/languages/R/functions/is_list[`is.list()`] should be used
