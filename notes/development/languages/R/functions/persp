$ R function: persp
@ persp

{ Simple example

}
{ Coloring the highs and lows #persp-color-high-lows

  This example is very similar to the last one but uses → development/languages/R/functions/colorRampPalette[`colorRampPalette`] to create a palette that is then used to color the high and low values in the graphic differently:

  gh|about-r|/functions/persp/colorRampPalette.R||

}
{ Using matrix

  This is an old example. I am nut sure anymore why I used the → development/languages/R/functions/matrix[`matrix`] function

  gh|about-r|/functions/persp/old.R||

  gh|about-r|/functions/persp/img/old.png||

}

sa:

  → development/languages/R/functions/graphics

  The → development/languages/R/functions/outer[`outer`] function comes in handy to create the `z` values with given `x` and `y` values and a formula that uses `x` and `y`).
