$ R function: read.table

{ Reading text within the source file into a dataframe

  With the `text=` parameter set, it's possible to read text that is stored *within the source file itself* into a
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame].

  Note how `read.table` is clever enough to recognize the different data types of the data read.

{ Quoted strings

  If the text to be read contains spaces, it can be quoted:

}
{ na.strings

  The `na.strings=` argument specifies a string constant that should be interpreted as → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector/NA[`NA`] when reading the data.

{ Reading data from the internet

 `read.table` recognizes an development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url and will fetch the data with → development/web/HTTP.
