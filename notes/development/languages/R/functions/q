$ R function: quit
@ quit

`quit` terminates the current R session.

`q` is an alias for `quit`.

{ Saving workspace image

  By default, `quit()` asks if the *workspace image* should be saved. The parameter `save` can be set to the string `no` or `yes` (or `ask` or `default`) so that no further interaction is required.
code {
> q(save='no')
code }

  Saving the workspace image can also be prevented by starting `R` with `--no-save`.
