$ R function: paste
@paste

`paste` concatenates the given strings.

By default, a space is put between the concatenated strings.

{ sep

  The `sep` argument specifies a string that is put between the joined strings.

}
{ Vectors

  When the first argument to `paste` is a  of → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector], `paste` returns a vector that consists of the same number of elements
  as the original vector. It does not join their elements:

  gh|about-r|/functions/paste/vector.R||

}
{ Recyclation rule

  However, when more than one vector is passed to `paste`, it uses the *recyclation rule* to concatenate the respective elements.

}
{ Using collapse

}

sa:


  → development/languages/R/functions/paste0[`paste0()`] is quite similar to `paste`, except that by default the strings are concatenated with nothing being put between them.
