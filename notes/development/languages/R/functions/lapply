$ R function: lapply
@ lapply

`lapply` applies a → development/languages/R/function to each element of a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector.

{ Simple example

  In the following example, the vector is `x` and the function is `func`. `lapply` thus creates a new vector that subsequently
  is plotted for verification:
  gh|about-r|/functions/lapply.R||

  gh|about-r|/functions/images/lapply.png||

}
{ Print each element of a vector on its own line

code {
> vec <- → development/languages/R/functions/c('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
> nil <- lapply(vec, → development/languages/R/functions/cat, '\n')
code }

}
