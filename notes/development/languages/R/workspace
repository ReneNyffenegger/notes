$ R: The workspace

The workspace is held in the computer's memory. It keeps, for examples, → development/languages/R/variable[variable definitions].

`→ development/languages/R/functions/ls[ls]` shows the variables and functions that are defined in the current workspace.

Use → development/languages/R/functions/rm[rm] to delete (remove) variables from the workspace.

The workspace can be saved to disk with → development/languages/R/functions/save_image[save.image].
