@ R

R was initially created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman from the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

{ R for data science

  R is one (or the?) predestined language for → development/Data/science[data science] as it allows to
  • → development/languages/R/tasks/import-data-into-R-for-processing[import your data] (be it from the web or a → development/databases[database])
  • transform it
  • → development/Data/visualization[visualize] it
  • explore it
  • model it
  • run statistical tests on it
  • create reports of the resuls.

{ Installation

  { Ubuntu / Debian

code {
sudo apt-get install r-base
code }

Optionally `r-base-html` might be installed to browse the hyperlinked documentation and `r-doc-html` to install important R manuals locally:
code {
sudo apt-get install r-doc-html r-base-html
code }

  }
  { Red Hat / Fedora

code {
sudo yum install R.i386
code }
  
  }
