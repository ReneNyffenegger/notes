$ R: Variables

When a variable is defined (`x <- 42`), the definition goes into the â†’ development/languages/R/workspace[workspace].

The type of a variable is not fixed, it can change with a new assignment (R is a *dynamically typed language*).

{ Variable assignments #variable-assignments

code {
local_var   <-  42
global_var <<- "foo"
â†’ development/languages/R/functions/assign[assign]('x', 'eggs')
local_var_2  = "bar"
"baz" -> local_var_3
code }

The latter two assignement forms (`=` and `->`) are rarely seen.
