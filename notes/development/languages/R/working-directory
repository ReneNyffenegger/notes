$ R: working directory

The *working directory* specifies the location where file operations (i.e. wrting and reading) take place by default (that is: without specifying an
absolute path).

The working directory is set with → development/languages/R/functions/setwd[`setwd()`] and queried with → development/languages/R/functions/getwd[`getwd()`].
The files in the working directory are returned by → development/languages/R/functions/list_files[`list.files()`].
