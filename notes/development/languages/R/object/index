$ R objects

All R objects are built upon the native → development/languages/R/data-structures[data structres]
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector],
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/matrices[matrix],
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/list[list] and
→ development/languages/R/data-structures/data-frame[data frame]

An object might have a `class` → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attribute] which should be a character → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector.
If this attribute is present, it contains the names of the classes from which this object inherits.
