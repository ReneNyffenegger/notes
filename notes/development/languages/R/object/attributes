$ R object attribute

A variable can have zero, one or more *attributes*.

An attribute is simply a name-value pair.

For example, a → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrices[matrix] stores its dimension in an attribute named *dim*.
The value of this dim is a → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vector] with two elements (rows and columns).

The attributes of a variable can be queried with → development/languages/R/functions/attributes[`attributes`] and
→ development/languages/R/functions/str[`str`].



{ colnames

  → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrices[Matrices] can have the colnames attribute set.

}
{ dimensions

  The dimension attribute can be used to turn → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors] and
  → development/languages/R/data-structures/list[lists] into matrices.

  See → development/languages/R/functions/dim[dim()]

}
{ names

  See → development/languages/R/functions/names[names()]

}
{ rownames

  → development/languages/R/data-structures/matrices[Matrices] can have the rownames attribute set.

}
{ class #class-attribute

  An object might have a `class` → development/languages/R/object/attributes[attribute] which should be a character → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector.
  If this attribute is present, it contains the names of the classes from which this object inherits.
  -
  This value tells various R → development/languages/R/functions/[methods] what to do with the variable (for example → development/languages/R/functions/plot[`plot`]).

  → development/languages/R/functions/class[`class`] prints the vector of names of the class attribute.
