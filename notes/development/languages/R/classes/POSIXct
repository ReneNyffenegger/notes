$ R: POSIXct class
@ POSIXct

A POSIXct object stores the number of seconds since 1970-01-01. Unlike the → development/languages/R/classes/Date[Date class], it is intended to also store
hours, minutes and seconds.

The number of seconds of a POSIXct object is returned by the → development/languages/R/functions/as/integer#r-as-integer-POSIXct[`as.integer()`] function.
