$ R: function

A function has three components:
  • body (See → development/languages/R/functions/body[`body()`])
  • arguments (See → development/languages/R/functions/formals[`formals()`])
  • environment (See → development/languages/R/functions/environment[`environment()`])

The environment makes it possible to create *closures*.

A function is an → development/languages/R/object[object]. This makes it possible to pass a function as arguments to other functions
(such as → development/languages/R/functions/lapply[`lapply`] etc.).

→ development/languages/R[R] allows to define a function within a function.

{ Evaluation environment

  When a function is called, an environment (the *evaluation environment*) is created in which the body of the function is evaluated.

}

sa:
  → development/languages/R/functions/on_exit[`on.exit(…)`] allows to register a function to be called when a function exits.
