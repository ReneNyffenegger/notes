{ Looping

  R has three statements for *explicit* looping over a piece of code: `for`, `while` and `repeat`.
  -
  Within the loops, `next` and `break` can be used.

 *Implicit* looping is performed with statements like → development/languages/R/functions/sapply[`sapply()`] etc.

  See also the → development/languages/R/packages/foreach[`foreach` package]


}
{ No return statement

  R does not have a `return` statement, → development/languages/R/function#r-function-return[but a `return` function(?)].
 
}
