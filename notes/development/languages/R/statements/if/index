{ Testing for equalness

  As in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C], two variables are tested for equalnes with the duplication of the equal sign (`==`):

}
{ else

  If an `if` is combined with an `else`, the `else` needs to be on the same line as the closing curly brace of the `if` part, otherwise, the error
 *unexpected '}' in "}"* is thrown.

  The following code snippet runs without error:

}
{ Variable scoping

  Variables have *function scope*. So, variables that are »declared« within the `if` or `else` body are visible outside the `if` statement.

sa:

  The `if` statement does not operate on → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors]. Functions that contain an `if` statement might be → development/languages/R/functions/Vectorize[vectorized] when used with vectors.
