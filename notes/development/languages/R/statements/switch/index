$ R: switch statement

{ First argument: numbers vs character

  The behaviour of `switch(…)` depends on the type of its first argument.


  If the first argument's type is a character string, the value of the argument is searched as *name* in the subsequent arguemnts. The value of the subsequent arguments that matches is returned:
  gh|about-r|/statements/switch/match.R||
    
  In the other cases, the value of the first argument is coerced into an integer. The element that matches tne value of the integer is then returned:
  gh|about-r|/statements/switch/index.R||

  gh|about-r|/statements/switch/expression.R||

{ Switching on a range #switch-range

  In order to test for a range, the `switch` statement can be combined with the
  → development/languages/R/functions/findInterval[`findInterval()`] function:
  
  gh|about-r|/statements/switch/range.R||

  See also the → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr[dplyr] function → development/languages/R/packages/dplyr#dplyr-case_when[`case_when`].
