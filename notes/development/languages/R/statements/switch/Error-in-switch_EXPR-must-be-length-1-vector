A simple method to look up the german words might be to use an additional vector and the → development/languages/R/operators#r-operator-brackets[bracket operator]:
gh|about-r|/statements/switch/vector/translation.R||

The desired functionality might also be achieved with a cascaded → development/languages/R/functions/ifelse[`ifelse`]:
gh|about-r|/statements/switch/vector/ifelse.R||

Another possibility is to put the `switch` statement into a function and then to use → development/languages/R/functions/sapply[`sapply`] to call the function with each element of `english`:
gh|about-r|/statements/switch/vector/sapply.R||

The function can also be vectorized with → development/languages/R/functions/Vectorize[`Vectorize(…)`]:
gh|about-r|/statements/switch/vector/Vectorize.R||


Finally, the → development/languages/R/packages/broman[package `broman`] has a special function for such a switch statement: → development/languages/R/packages/broman#broman-switchv[`switchv`].
