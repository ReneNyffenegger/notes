$ R command line startup options

`--quiet`: suppresses the startup message.

`--slave`: more quiet than `--quiet` in that it does not print the input.

`--no-restore`: Does not restore a previously saved → development/languages/R/workspace[workspace]. Thus, the workspace is empty.

`--no-save`: Do not save a → development/languages/R/workspace[workspace] when R is exited. Compare with `→ development/languages/R/functions/q[quit](save='no')`

`--no-init-file`: Don't read `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_Rprofile` nor `→ development/languages/R/files/_Rprofile`.

`--no-environ`: Don't search for site and user files to process for setting → development/languages/R/environment-variables[environment variables].
