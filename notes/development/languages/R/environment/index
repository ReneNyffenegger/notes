{ Tree structure of environments

  With one exception, all environments have a parent that itself is an environment.
  -
  Thus, the environments form a tree structure between themselves.

  The one exception is the *emtpy environment*. This environment
  is returned by the function → development/languages/R/functions/emptyenv[`emptyenv()`].
  -
  This root environment is the (direct) parent environment of the *base package* (which is available through → development/languages/R/functions/baseenv[`baseenv()`].


}
{ Functions

  → development/languages/R/function[functions] have their own environment.

}

sa:
  → development/languages/R/functions/environment[`environment`],
  → development/languages/R/functions/new/env[`new.env`],
  → development/languages/R/functions/baseenv[`baseenv`]
