$ The R home directory

The *R home directory* contains the configuration and installation files. It is identified with the
`→ development/environment-variable#r_home` environment variable.

{ Determine the path of the R home directory

  In an R session, the value of `R_HOME` can be displayed like so:
code {
> → development/languages/R/functions/Sys_getenv[Sys.getenv]('R_HOME')
[1] "/usr/lib/R"
code }

  Alternatively, it can be shown on a shell by executing:
code {
$ R RHOME
/usr/lib/ R
code }

}
{ Files found in the R home directory

  { etc/Renviron

   `R_HOME/etc/Renviron` contains environment variables to configure some aspects of R.

    This file is read early in the start-up processing.

    In my current Debian installation (`apt install r-base`), `/usr/lib/R/etc/Renviron` is a symlink to `→ Linux/fhs/etc/R/Renviron`.

  }
