$ R graphics: adding a grid

The value of a graph might be increased by adding a grid to it.

This can be done using the → development/languages/R/functions/grid[`grid`] → development/languages/R/functions[function].

Note: in the following example, → development/languages/R/functions/grid[`grid`] is first called and → development/languages/R/functions/points[`points`] afterwards in order to not overpaint the grid with the points:
gh|about-r|/graphics/decoration/grid.R||

→ development/languages/R/graphics/decoration/grid.png

sa:
  → development/languages/R/graphics
