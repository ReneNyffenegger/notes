$ R graphics

Graphics can be produced *interactively* and in *batch mode*.

The commands to produce and manipulate graphics are broadly divided into three groups:
  • *High level* to create new plots, decorated with axes, labels, titles etc.
  • *Low level* to add more details (points, lines, labels) to the graphic
  • *Interactive* to add more details with the mouse


{ Devices #r-graphic-device

  When used *interactively*, R initiates a *graphics device driver* which in turn opens a *graphics windows* where the graphics are displayed. The commands that are (automatically) invoked
  are → development/languages/R/functions/X11[`X11()`] on → Linux[Unix], `windows()` on → Windows[Windows] and `quartz()` on Mac.

  New devices can always be opened with → development/languages/R/functions/dev_new[`dev.new()`].

}
{ Packages

  *Base graphics* is the original graphic system of → development/languages/R[R] and is loaded when R is started.
  -
  It's main function is → development/languages/R/functions/plot[`plot()`].

  `grid` was added later. It allows to create *viewports* on a graphic page.

  → development/languages/R/packages/lattice[`lattice`] and → development/languages/R/packages/ggplot2[`ggplot2`] are built on `grid`.
