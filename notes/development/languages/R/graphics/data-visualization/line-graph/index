$ R data visualization: line graphs
@ Line graphs

A line graph is very similar to a → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/scatter-plot[scatter plot], yet, instead of drawing
dots in connects them with a smoot line.

In R, this can be achieved, for example, with → development/languages/R/functions/plot[`plot`] and the argument `type="l"`.

The following is mostly a copy paste of → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/scatter-plot[this example], yet with using `type="l"` instead of `type="p"`:
