$ R data visualization: scatter plot
@ Scatter plot


One of the most important → development/languages/R/functions[R function] to create a scatter plot is → development/languages/R/functions/plot[`plot`].

The following example is a simple demonstration on how to do that:
gh|about-r|/graphics/data-visualization/scatter-plot/plot-2-vectors.R||

→ development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/scatter-plot/plot-2-vectors.png

{ type=p vs type=l

  With `type="p"`, plot produces points. This can be changed by using `type="l"`, in which case plot will
  produce a → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/line-graph[line graph].

}
