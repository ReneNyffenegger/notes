$ R data visualization: bar chart for mean (average) of bins/groups

The following example first creates two → development/languages/R/data-structures/vector[vectors]: `x` and `y`.
-
Using → Linux/shell/commands/cut[`cut`], three groups are created. The first group is for `x` between 10 and 20, the second group for `x` between 20 and 30 and
the third group for `x` between 30 and forty. Each element in `bins` stores to which group each element in `x` belongs.
-
`bins` is then used in → development/languages/R/functions/tapply[`tapply`] to calculate the → development/languages/R/functions/mean[`mean`] for each group's `y` elements. The result is stored in `mean_`.

→ development/languages/R/functions/barplot[`barplot`] creates a bar chart whose bars' heights correspond to the mean of each group.

Lastly, → development/languages/R/functions/points[`points`] overlays a → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/scatter-plot[scatter plot] with the original x/y pairs.
