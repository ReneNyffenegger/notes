$ R data visualization: histogram
@ Histogram

{ A most simple example

  The most important → development/languages/R/functions[R function] to create a histogram is → development/languages/R/functions/hist[`hist`]:
  gh|about-r|/graphics/data-visualization/histogram/simple.R||
  
  → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/histogram/simple.png
  
  You might want to → development/languages/R/graphics/decoration[decorate] the output with → development/languages/R/graphics/decoration/title-and-labels[a title and labels].

}
{ Adding bins to the histogram

  The above example only shows 10 bins. This might be too little to reveal the underlying distribution of the data.

  The second argument to `hist` allows to specify the numbers of bins drawn:
  gh|about-r|/graphics/data-visualization/histogram/number-of-bins.R||
  
  → development/languages/R/graphics/data-visualization/histogram/number-of-bins.png

}
