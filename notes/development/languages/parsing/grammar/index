$ Grammar (parsing)
@ grammar

A grammar is a *set of rules* that describe a language. The rules consist of
  • A finite set of non-terminal symbols («variables»), typically denoated by N. The elements of this set are typically written as uppercase letters.
  • A finite set of terminals, disjoint from N, typically denoted by Σ. The elements of this set are typically written as lowercase letters.
  • A finite set of production rules, typically denoted by P
  • A starting symbol that is an element of N, typically denoted by S.

The set of strings that can be generated by a grammar is a *language*.

A notation for a *syntax free* grammar is → development/languages/parsing/EBNF.

Lexical symbols:
  • identifiers
  • numbers
  • strings
  • operators
  • delimiters
  • comments
  • …?

Lexical symbols are composed of characters (note the distinction).

{ Types of grammars (Chomsky hierarchy)

  table { llll

           ☰ ~Grammar accepted~ ☰ ~Language accepted~ ☰ ~Automaton~ / ~Machine~
    Type 0 ☰ Unrestricted grammar ☰ Recursively enumarable language ☰ Touring machine (Deterministic (DTM) vs Non-deterministic (NTM), the default being DTM
    Type 1 ☰ Context sensitive grammar ☰ Context sensitive language ☰ Linear bounded automata (LBA) (also deterministic vs. non-deterministic)
    Type 2 ☰ Context free grammar ☰ Context free lanuage ☰ Push down automata (PDA), also D vs N, the default being NPDA
    Type 3 ☰ Regular grammar ☰ Regular language ☰ Finite automata (FA), also DFA vs NFA, the default being DFA

  { Expressive power

    Type 0 grammars have the most expressive power, Type 3 the least expressive power.

    The expressive power of of DFAs is equal to the expressive power of NFAs. Therefore, every NFA can be converted into a DFA.

    The expressive power of NPDAs is greated than the expressive power of DPDAs. Therefore, some NPDAs can't be converted into a DPDA.

    The expressive power of DTMs is equal to the expressive power of NTMs.

  { Memory requirements

    FA: no memory needed

    PDA: FA + 1 stack
    -
    TM = FA + 2 stacks

  }
  { Misc

    The Chomsky hierarchy is sometimes alse referred to as *Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy*, after the French mathematician Marcel-Paul Schützenberger.
