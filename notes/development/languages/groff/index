{ Macro packages

  Macros build on groff's low-level faicilities and are used to specify how certain elements (such as starting a paragraph, layout of headers and footers etc.) should be executed.

  The most common macro packages are man, mdoc, me, ms and mm (With *man* probably being the most popular).

 The command line option `-m` specifies the macro package to be used for processing:
code {
$ groff -m man …
code }

}
{ Devices

  Man pages can be created for different devices. When invoking `groff`, the device can be stated with the `-T` option. Some interesting devices, imho, are: *dvi*, *Xn* (n=75, 100 etc) for X11 previewer,
  *ascii*, *latin1*, *utf8*, *html*.
