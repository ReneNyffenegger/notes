{ Cargo

  Cargo is Ruts's build system and package manager.

  { Creating a new project

code {
cargo new foo-app --bin

  `--bin`: a binary project.

  }
  { Building a project

    A project might be built with

code {
cargo build

  } 

}
{ Variables

  By default, variables are immutable.

code {
let     answer = 42;  // always 42
let mut maybe  =  9;  // can be changed (is mutable)
code }

}

  toml stands for *Tom's obvious minimal language*.

  toml files are similar to *.ini files.
