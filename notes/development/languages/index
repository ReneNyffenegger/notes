{ History bits

  1930s: Alonzo Church and Stpehen Cole Kleene developed the *lambda calculus* which some consider to be the world's first programming language.
  -
  However, it was intended to *model* computation rather than to *describe* algorithms to a computer system.

  1940s: Konrad Zuse desgned *Plankalkül*, the first (real?) programming languauge - but was only implemented 1998.

  1954-1957: John Backus and his team of → Companies-Products/IBM researchers develop Fortran, the first widely known and successful *hih-level programming language*.

  ALGOL 58, an attempt to develop a *universal* computer language.

  John McCarthy (MIT) developed → development/languages/Lisp, based on the *lambda calculus*.
