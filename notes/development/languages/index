{ History bits

  1930s: Alonzo Church and Stpehen Cole Kleene developed the *lambda calculus* which some consider to be the world's first programming language.
  -
  However, it was intended to *model* computation rather than to *describe* algorithms to a computer system.

  1940s: Konrad Zuse designed *Plankalkül*, the first (real?) programming language - but was only implemented 1998.

  1954-1957: John Backus and his team of → Companies-Products/IBM researchers develop Fortran, the first widely known and successful *high-level programming language*.

  ALGOL 58, an attempt to develop a *universal* computer language.

  John McCarthy (MIT) developed → development/languages/Lisp, based on the *lambda calculus*.

  → https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs] is recommended by many and also by Robert C. Martin.

  → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3[LC-3] (Little Computer 3) is an *educational* assembly language with a instruction set that is less complex than x86.
  -
  → https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/[lc3-vm] is a virtual machine for LC-3. Its github repository is → https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-vm[here].


  { LLVM


    Subprojects of LLVM include
    table { ll
      LLVM Core libraries ☰  source- and target-independent optimizer; code generation support for popular → hardware/CPU[CPUs]
      Clang ☰ A  *LLVM native* C/C++/Objective-C compiler.
      libc++ and libc++ ABI ☰  implementation of the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP-Standard-Library, including full support for C++11 and C++14.
      libclc ☰ Implementation of the OpenCL standard library
      LLD ☰ A linker
      klee ☰ A *symbolic virtual machine*. It uses a theorem prover in order to try to find bugs and to prove properties of functions; it can produce a testcase in the event that it detects a bug.
      LLDB ☰
      compiler-rt ☰ 
      MLIR ☰
      OpenMP ☰
      polly ☰ 

    table }

    Misc:
      • *LLVM IR* is the intermediate representation
      • The *Clang Static Analyzer* and *clang-tidy* are tools that automatically find bugs in your code.
