$ PEP 263 - Defining Python Source Code Encodings

→ development/languages/Python/PEP[PEP] 263 specifies that a *magic comment* can be placed in the first or second line of a Python source file to specify the → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encoding] of the file.

In order for a line to be recognized as such a magic comment, it must match the → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] `^[ \t\f]*#.*?coding[:=][ \t]*([-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+)`, for example
code {
# coding=latin-1
code }

or
code {
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
code }

or the following line (which simultaneously sets a → development/vim/options[vim option]):
code {
# vim: fileencoding=iso-8859-15
code }
