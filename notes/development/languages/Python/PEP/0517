$ PEP 517 - A build-system independent format for source trees

`→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/distutils` and `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/setuptools` suffer from the following problems:
  • It's not possible to declare dependencies at build time
  • Extending these two libraries is difficult
  • It is also difficult to use libraries other than these two mentioned.

The goal of PEP 517 is to address the third problem and to be independent of the → development/languages/Python#py-sig[special interest group] distutils-sig.

{ pip …

code {
$ pip install …
DEPRECATION: … is being installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method,
because it does not have a 'pyproject.toml' and the 'wheel' package is not installed.
pip 23.1 will enforce this behaviour change.
A possible replacement is to enable the '--use-pep517' option.
