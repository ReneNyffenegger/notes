$ PEP 668 - Marking Python base environments as “externally managed”

PEP 668 discuses the problems that can arise when multiple installers operate on the same Python installation.

This PEP is a historical document - the up-to-date canonical spec is → https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/#externally-managed-environments[Externally Managed Environments].

{ TODO

  { Debian

    Debian declares its Python install to be *externally managed*.

    Thus, pip (and other installers) will refuse to install packages system-wide.

    pip allows to install packages only
      • to virtual environments
      • to separate Python installations
      • when the `--break-system-packages` option is used (this option is not available in `pip` but must be stated with `sudo python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages …`)
      • by setting the environment variable `PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` to 1 and exporting it
      • adding the option `break-system-packages = true` under the `[global]` section in `~/.config/pip/pip.conf` or `/etc/pip.conf`.
      • Removing `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/python3_x/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`


  In Debian:
code {
$ sudo python3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

    See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.
