$ Python PEPs

*PEP* stands for *→ development/languages/Python Enhancement Proposal*.
-
The main purpose of PEPs is to
  • inform the Python community about new proposed features, processes etc.
  • document design decisions
  • collecting community input on an issue

According to the PEPs' purpose, there are three kind of PEPS:
table { ll
    ☰ ~Description~ and ~general notes~
  Standard track PEPs ☰ New features and implementations (especially CPython), interoperability standards. Normative.
  Informational PEPs ☰ Design issues, guidelines, background information that are of general interest to the Python ecosystem. Non-normative.
  Process PEPs ☰ Processes surrounding Python and proposed changes. Normative.
table }

PEPs are maintained as *text files* and → https://github.com/python/peps[version controlled on Github]. They're automatically published at → https://peps.python.org[peps.python.org].

A categorized index of existing PEPs is maintained in → https://peps.python.org/[PEP 0].

{ PEP status

  table { lll
    ~Status~ ☰ ~Description~ ☰ ~Next status~
    Draft ☰ Proposal under active discussion and revision ☰ Accepted, Provisional, Deferred, Rejected or Withdrawn
    Accepted ☰ Normative proposal accepted for implementation ☰ Final
    Final ☰ Accepted and reference implementation merged into main source code repo, or no longer active ☰ Replaced (Superseded?)
    Provisional ☰ Provisionally accepted but additional feedback needed ☰ Final, Rejected or Withdrawn
    Rejected ☰ Formally declined and will not be accepted ☰
    Withdrawn ☰ Removed from consideration by sponsor or authors ☰
    Active ☰ Used for *informational* and *process* PEPs that were never meant to be completed (such as → https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/[PEP 1]) ☰ ?
    Deferred ☰ Inactive draft that may be taken up again at a later time ☰ Draft
    Superseded (Replaced?) ☰ Replaced by another succeeding PEP ☰
  table }

sa:
  
  → development/languages/Java (or OpenJDK?) has JEPs (JDK Enhancement Proposals).

  → Linux/distributions/Gentoo#gentoo-glep[Gentoo GLEPs] are very similar in nature to PEPs.
