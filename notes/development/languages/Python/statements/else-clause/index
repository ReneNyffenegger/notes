$ Python statements: else clause

Some → development/languages/Python/statements[statements] have an `else` clause:
   • → development/languages/Python/statements/if[`if`]
   • → development/languages/Python/statements/for[`for`]
   • → development/languages/Python/statements/try[`try`]
   • → development/languages/Python/statements/while[`while`]

{ The else clause executed if successfully completed

  In the `for`, `try` and `while` statements, the `else` clause can be interpreted as to mean *successfully completed*.

  In the *loop* statements, the `else` clause is executed if the loop statement is not prematurely exited with a → development/languages/Python/statements/break[`break`] statement.

  In a `try` statement, the `else` clause is executed if no exception was caught:
