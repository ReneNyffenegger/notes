$ Python: statement def

`def` defines a *user defined function* object.

{ Function without arguments

}
{ Argument with one star (or asterisk)

  An argument that is prefixed with a star (asterisk) (`*b`) allows to pass any number of positional arguments to the function.

  The type of the argument is a *tuple*, thus, it is possible to iterate over the optional values that are passed to the function.

}
{ Argument with two stars #py-def-two-stars

  Similarly, an argument can be declared with two prefixing stars. In that case, the function expects there to be passed any number
  of *named arguments*. The type of the argument within the function is a → development/languages/Python/types/dict.

  See also → development/languages/Python/types/dict/merge[merging two dictionaries] where two stars are used to »unpack« dictionaries.

}
{ Calling a function

  When a function is called, a *namespace* is created.
  -
  This namespace is destroyed when the function is exited.

  When functions are called recursively, each function invocation gets its own namespace.

}
{ docstring #py-def-docstring

  If a function's first statement is just a string literal, the value of this string becomes the function's → development/languages/Python/docstring and can be queried on the function object's
  → development/languages/Python/dunders/__doc__[`__doc__`] attribute.

}
{ Symbol table

  The `def` statement inserts the function name in the current *symbol table*.

}
{ TODO

  In order to create a → development/languages/Python/generators[generator] function, the function definition must have a → development/languages/Python/statements/yield[`yield`] statement - and this is also sufficient to
  create such a generator function.
