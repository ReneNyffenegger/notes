$ Python: using the global statement in modules

The following example tries to demonstrate the usage of the `→ development/languages/Python/statements/global` statement in a → development/languages/Python/module.

{ The module (tq84_mod.py)

  The module has one function, `func()`, which assigns a value (`assigned in module's func()`) to a global → development/languages/Python/variables. This variable is global within the module,
  not within the entire execution.

}
{ The script

  The script imports the module, assigns a value to `var` calls `func()` in the module and then prints the module's and the script's value of `var`.

  gh|about-python|/statements/global/module/tq84_mod.py||

  Because the script's (global) `var` variable is another variable than the module's global `var` variable, the script, when executed, prints:
code {
var          = assigned in script
tq84_mod.var = assigned in module's func()
code }

}
