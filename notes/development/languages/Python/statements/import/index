$ Python: import statement
-

The `import` statement searches the directories in → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys#python-sys-path[`sys.path`] for modules and packages.

{ import executes the imported module

  This is the module that is imported:
  gh|about-python|/statements/import/run-imported-module/tq84Module.py||

  When a script uses `import tq84Module`, the content of `tq84Module.py` is executed. So, running the following code will print `This is printed from within tq84Module`.
  gh|about-python|/statements/import/run-imported-module/importer.py||

}
{ import executes an imported package's __init__.py

  Here's an `__init__.py` file, stored under `tq84Package`:
  gh|about-python|/statements/import/run-__init__/tq84Package/__init__.py||

  Here's a script that imports the package:
  gh|about-python|/statements/import/run-__init__/import-package.py||

  When this script is run, it prints
code {
This is printed from within tq84Package/__init__.py
code }

  Here's another script that imports a module within the package.
  gh|about-python|/statements/import/run-__init__/import-module.py||

When this script is run, it prints
code {
This is printed from within tq84Package/__init__.py
This is printed from within tq84Package/tq84Module.py
code }

}
