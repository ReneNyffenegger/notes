{ Iterating over a comma seperated list of items

}
{ Iterating over a list #py-for-in-list

  Similarly, the `for in` statement allows to iterate over a → development/languages/Python/types/list[list].

  Unlike in Perl's → development/languages/Perl/functions/foreach#perl-foreach-alias[`foreach`] statement, the iteration-variable
  is not aliased to the elements in the list being iterated over.

  The `for x in someList` construct is also used in → development/languages/Python/types/list/comprehension[list comprehensions].

}
{ Iterating over a numeric range #py-for-num-range

  The `for` statement also allows to iterate over a given numeric range.

  See also the built in function → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/range[`range`].

{ Iterating over the characters of a string #py-for-char-in-str

  The `for` statement also allows to iterate over the characters of a string:

}
{ The variable is not local to the loop

  A variable that is declared in a `for` statement is accessible after the loop has finished and retains its last value.

  This is demonstrated with this script: 
  gh|about-python|/statements/for/iterate-over-characters.py||

  When run, it prints
code {
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
Value of i after the loop: 2
code }

}
