$ Python: statement class

The `class` statement creates
  • a new *namespace* which becomes the local scope within the defintion of the class.
  • a *class object* (is this the metaclass?)

{ Constructor

  The name of a class's constructor is `__init__`

}
{ Calling the constructor of a base class

  Unlike C++, the constructor of a derived class does not call the constructor of the base class.
  If desired, it needs to be explicitely called.

}
{ Metaclass

  A *class definition* consists of
    • a class name
    • a class dictionary
    • a list of base classes

  These items are managed by a class's metaclass.

}
