The → development/languages/Python/statements/class[`class`] statement is just a »container« for other statements of which
the → development/languages/Python/statements/def[`def`] statement is special because it creates the class's methods.

The following example tries to demonstrate how the statements within a class are executed while the class is parsed:
gh|about-python|/statements/class/statements.py||
