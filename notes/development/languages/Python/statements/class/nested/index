$ Python: nested classes

{ Simple example

  A nested class can be created and used *outside* the class that it contains by fully qualifying its name:

  gh|about-python|/statements/class/nested/ex-1.py||

}
{ Fully qualified name required

  Interestingly, even if the nested class is used *within* the class that contains it, its name still needs to be fully qualifed (in the following example, that is either `self.Nested` or `CLS.Nested`):

  gh|about-python|/statements/class/nested/qualify-name.py||

}
