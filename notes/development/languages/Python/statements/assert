Python: assert statement

code {
assert condition
assert condition, expr
code }

`assert ….` does nothing if → development/languages/Python/dunders/__debug__[`__debug__`] is `False`.

If → development/languages/Python/dunders/__debug__[`__debug__`] is `True`, `assert condition` checks if `condition` is `True` and raises an `AssertionError` → development/languages/Python/exception-handling[exception] otherwise.
-
If the optional expression `expr` is also present, it passes `expr` to the constructor of `AssertionError`.
