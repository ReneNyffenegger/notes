$ Python: yield from
@ yield from

`yield from gen` abbreviates
code {
for val in gen:
    → development/languages/Python/statements/yield val
code }

However, `yield from` does much more behind the scenes. For example, values passed to a generator with → development/languages/Python/generators#py-gen-send-throw-close[`.send()`] are transparently handled.

{ Simple example

  → https://stackoverflow.com/a/66502060[This Stackoverflow answer] was helpful to understand `yield from`
code {
def yieldXYZ():

    yield 'X'
    yield 'Y'
    yield 'Z'


def yieldFromYieldXYZ():

    for i in range(3):
        yield from yieldXYZ()


for x in yieldFromYieldXYZ():            
    print(x)
code }

  When executed, it prints
code {
X
Y
Z
X
Y
Z
X
Y
Z
code }

}
{ Modifying yielded elements

  In the following example, the function `squaredNubmers` uses `yield from` to create lists with two elements: the first is the number yielded from `numbers` while the second one is the number squared:
code {
def numbers():
    yield  7
    yield 28
    yield 12
    yield  3


def squaredNubmers():
    yield from ( [x, x**2] for x in numbers() )


for i in squaredNubmers():
    print(f'{i[0]} -> {i[1]}')
code }

  I am not sure if this is a form of → development/languages/Python/types/list/comprehension.

{ Flattening nested lists

code {
def flatten(listOrElem):

    if isinstance(listOrElem, list):
       for x in listOrElem:
           yield from flatten(x)

    else:
       yield listOrElem


for i in flatten( [ 1, ['a', 'b', ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV' ], 'c' ], 2, 3] ):
    print(i)
code }

}

  been a better wording than `yield from`.
