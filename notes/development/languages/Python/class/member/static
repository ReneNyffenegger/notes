$ Python: static class members

Static → development/languages/Python/class/member[class member] are possible in → development/languages/Python/class[classes].

In order to create a static variable (aka class-variable) is created as part of the → development/languages/Python/statements/class[`class`] statement by assigning a value to a
→ development/languages/Python/variables[variable]. This variable then becomes the static data member.

In order to define a static method, the → development/languages/Python/statements/def[`def`] statement needs to be prefixed with `@staticmethod`.
