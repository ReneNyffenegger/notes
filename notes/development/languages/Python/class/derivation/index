$ Python: class derivation

Python allows to derive (child-)→ development/languages/Python/class[classes] from parent/base classes.

In the declaration of the derived class, the name of the base class appears in parantheses after the name of the derived class.

When a method is called on the derived class without overriding it, the base class' method (with the same name) will be called

{ Overriding methods in derived classes

  The following example tries to demonstrate how → development/languages/Python/class/methods[methods] might be overridden in derived classes:

}
{ Calling methods of base classes

  A method is able to call a base class's → development/languages/Python/class/methods[method] using the
  → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/super[`super()`] built-in function.

}

sa:
  A use case of deriving classes is to → development/languages/Python/statements/try#py-user-defined-exception[derive from an exception class to create user defined exceptions].
