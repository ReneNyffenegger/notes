CPython is the reference implementation for → development/languages/Python.

{ High Level view of the CPython front-end

  → https://eli.thegreenplace.net[eli Bendersky's] article on → https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/09/18/python-internals-symbol-tables-part-1[Symbol tables] lists the four main actions of the CPython front-end as follows:
    • (1) Parse source code into a parse tree
    • (2) Transform parse tree into an Abstract Syntax Tree
    • (3) Transform AST into a Control Flow Graph
    • (4) Emit → development/languages/Python/internals/bytecode based on the Control Flow Graph

{ Global Interpreter Lock #py-gil

  The *Global Interpreter Lock* (GIL) makes sure that in any given Python process, at most one thread access the byte code at any one time.

 `sys.setswitchinterval()` determines how frequently Python's virtual machine switches between threads.

  See also the → development/languages/Python/standard-library/threading[`threading`] module.

  CPythons development model can be enabled with the → development/languages/Python/command-line/options[command line option] `-X dev`. This changes the following features:
    •  Add default warning filter, as `-W` default
    •  Install debug hooks on memory allocators: see the `PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()` C function
    •  Enable the faulthandler module to dump the Python traceback on a crash
    •  Enable asyncio debug mode
    •  Set the dev_mode attribute of `sys.flags` to `True`
    •  io.IOBase destructor logs close() exceptions
