$ Python: range

Although the → https://docs.python.org/3[Python documentation] lists `range()` under → https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html[built-in functions], it is not a function, but an *immutable sequence type*.

`range()` comes in three variants:
  • `range(stop)`
  • `range(start, stop)`
  • `range(start, stop, step)`

It should be noted that the value of `stop` is not generated.
