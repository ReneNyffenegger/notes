$ Python: range
@ range

Although the → https://docs.python.org/3[Python documentation] lists `range()` under → https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html[built-in functions], it is not a function, but an *immutable sequence type*.

`range()` comes in three variants:
  • `range(stop)`
  • `range(start, stop)`
  • `range(start, stop, step)`

It should be noted that the value of `stop` is not generated.

{ TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer 

  The arguments to `range` must be integers, otherwise a `TypeError` exception is thrown.

  It's possible to use floats with `numpy`:
code {
import → development/languages/Python/libraries/numpy as np
for i in np.arange(0.5, 5.5, 0.3):
    print(i)
code }

}
