$ Python: filter
@ filter

`filter` can be used to extract elements from a list that meet a certain condition. It's probably the closest equivalent to
→ development/languages/Perl/functions/grep[Perl's grep function].

{ Filter in combination with a lambda function

  The following snippet uses a → development/languages/Python/expressions/lambda[`lambda`] expression to filter the numbers whose length is less or equal to four characters:

  gh|about-Python|/builtin-functions/filter/lambda.py||

}

sa:

  `filter(…)` is different from → development/languages/Python/types/list/comprehension[list comprehension] in that `filter(…)` returns an iterator (a *filter* object) while
  the list comprehension returns a list.

  → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions
