$ Python: zip

The built-in function `zip` has nothing to do with → development/archive-files/zip[zip files]. Rather, it creates an → development/languages/Python/iterable/iterator[iterator] from a set of other iterators. The
created iterator emits → development/languages/Python/types/tuple[tuples] when it is iterated over. The elements of the n-nth tuple correspond to the n-th element in the input-iterators.

{ Unequal length of «input» iterators

  If the «input»-iterators provide an unequal number of elements, the `zip()` function just stops after finishing the shortest iterator:
