$ Python: isinstance

code {
instance(→ development/languages/Python/objects[obj],  CLS)
instance(→ development/languages/Python/objects[obj], (CLS_1, CLS_2, … CLS_N))
code }

`isinstance` has to → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[two arguments]. The first argument takes an arbitrary → development/languages/Python/objects[object], the seconds is an object whose type
is → development/languages/Python/types/type[`type`] or a → development/languages/Python/types/tuple[tuple] of `type` objects.

`isinstance(obj, CLS)` returns `True` if `obj` is an instance of the → development/languages/Python/class[class] CLS or → development/languages/Python/class/derivation[derives from it]. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
