$ Python: next()

{ Beware of None #py-next-None

  The idiom `while elem := next(itr)` might not do what is expected if the list that is iterated over contains a `None` value:
  gh|about-Python|/builtin-functions/next/while-with-None.py||

  The → development/languages/Python/statements/while[`while`] statement ends after `bar` is returned because `None` is → development/languages/Python/objects/evaluating-in-boolean-context[considered to be `False`].
code {
foo
bar
code }

}
{ Skipping lines when reading a file #python-next-skip-line

  The following code snippet → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/open/iterate-over-each-line-in-file[iterates over the lines in a file] and prints them. However, the
  first line is skipped with the `next()` function:

  gh|about-Python|/builtin-functions/next/open.py||

}

  → development/languages/Python/iterable/iterator[iterators]
