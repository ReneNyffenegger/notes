{ Type of functions

  If `type` is applied to the (so called) built-in functions, it turns out that the class some of these functions is `builtin_function_or_method` and the class of other functions is simply `type`.
  -
 `help` is special in that its class is `_sitebuiltins._Helper` (and that it doas not have the `__name__` attribute).

  In the following table, the colum *built-in* is ticked if `type(f)` returns `builtin_function_or_method`:
