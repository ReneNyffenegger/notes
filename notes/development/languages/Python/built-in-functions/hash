$ Python: hash
@ hash

`hash(obj)` is only defined on *hashable types* such as → development/languages/Python/types/tuple[tuples].

{ Misc

  An → development/languages/Python/objects[object's] hash value is used to store the object in a → development/languages/Python/types/dict[`dict`].

  Because a → development/languages/Python/types/list is not hashable, a list cannot be used as a key in a `dict`.
