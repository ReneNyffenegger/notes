{ Write text without new lines

  The → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[parameter] `end` controls what is printed after the text to be printed. Its default is the → development/line-break[new line].
  -
  The following example assigns a whitespace to `end` so that multiple invocations of `print` write on the same line.

  Alternatively, text without new lines can also be written with `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys/stdin-stdout-stderr[sys.stdout].write()`.

}
{ Print a list

  If a → development/languages/Python/types/list is passed to `print()`, the list is printed with the square brackets (`[ elem, elem… ]`).

  In order to print the individual elements of the list, the list must be prepended with a `*` (unpacking operator):

}
{ Print elements with a user defined separator

 The `sep` → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[parameter] allows to define the separator with which the elements are printed.
