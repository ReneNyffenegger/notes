$ Python: print

gh|about-python|/builtin-functions/print/demo.py||

{ Write text without new lines

  The → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[parameter] `end` controls what is printed after the text to be printed. Its default is the → development/line-break[new line].
  -
  The following example assigns a whitespace to `end` so that multiple invocations of `print` write on the same line.

  Alternatively, text without new lines can also be written with `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys/stdin-stdout-stderr[sys.stdout].write()`.
