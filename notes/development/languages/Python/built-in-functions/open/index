$ Python: open()

`open` is used to open a file for reading or writing. The function returns a → development/languages/Python/standard-library/io#python-io-file-object[file object].

The following example is a Python script that prints its own content. (→ development/languages/Python/dunders/__file__[`__file__`]) evaluates the filename of the script):

{ Using open together with a with statement

  Because the file that is opened should eventually be closed, it is advisable to use `open()` together with a → development/languages/Python/statements/with[`with` statement].
  gh|about-python|/builtin-functions/open/with.py||

  As soon as the `with` is exited, the file will be closed automatically.

}
{ open is io.open #py-open-is-io-open

 `open()` is defined in the function → development/languages/Python/standard-library/io#py-io-open[`open()` of the `io` module]. This can be verified with the
  → development/languages/Python/operators/is[`is` operator]:
  gh|about-python|/builtin-functions/open/open-is-io.open.py||

  `open()` can also be used to open a reference to → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys/stdin-stdout-stderr#stdout-or-file[`sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`].
