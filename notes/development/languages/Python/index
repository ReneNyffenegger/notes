{ Packages and modules

  Analogy:
   • Packages correspond to directories. Seperator is `.` (rather than `/`).
   • Modules correspond to files within those directories.
  However, there is no need for packages and modules to actually exist as files or directories.

  All packages are also modules, but only modules with a `__path__` attribute are also a package.

  Regular packages (with `__init__.py`) vs. namespace packages (without `__init__.py`).
