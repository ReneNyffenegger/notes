{ Return a function

  A function can return another function:

{ Global/local variables in a function / symbol tables #py-func-symbol-tables

  When the Python interpreter executes a function, it creates a → development/languages/Python/internals/symbol-table[symbol table] for the function for the duration of the execution. This symbol table stores the
  local → development/languages/Python/variables[variables] and the → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[function parameters].

  If a value is assigned to a variable in a function, a new local variable is created and stored in the symbol table.

  If a variable is referenced in a function, the interpreter first tries to look it up in the current function's symbol table. If it doesn't exist there, it tries to look it up in the
  symbol table of the enclosing namespace, and so on until it reaches the global symbol table and lastly the symbol table of → development/languages/Python/dunders/__builtins__[built in names].

  If a value is assigned to variable after referencing it, a `UnboundLocalError` exception is thrown (local variable … referenced before assignment).
 
  In order to mark a variable in a function as global, the → development/languages/Python/statements/global[`global` statement] must be used.

  The current symbol table is returned by the → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/locals[`locals()`] built-in function, as is demonstrated by the following snippet:
  gh|about-Python|/functions/locals.py||

  This snippet, when executed, prints
code {
p1  = foo
p2  = bar
var = baz
code }

  Note also that a → development/languages/Python/statements/def[`def` statement] inserts the name of the function that is being defined into the (then) current symbol table.

}
{ Functions without return statement #py-func-no-return

  A function that is left without explicitly returning a value with the → development/languages/Python/statements/return[`return` statement] implicitely returns `None`.

  gh|about-Python|/functions/no-return.py||

  This snippet prints
code {
p = 42
None
code }

  In this example, the → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/print[`print()`] function is needed because `None` is otherwise omitted by the interpreter.
