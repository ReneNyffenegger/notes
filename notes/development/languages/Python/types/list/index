$ Python: list
@ list

A *list* is a → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence type. It can contain → development/languages/Python/objects[objects] of different
→ development/languages/Python/types[types].

In order to create a list of elements that all have the same types, the → development/languages/Python/standard-library/array[`array` module] can be used.

A *list* is not a linked list, it provides access to its element in `O(1)`.

{ Creating a list from a string #py-list-create-from-string

  When a list is created from a → development/languages/Python/types/string[string], the characters of the string become the elements in the list:

  An element can be removed from a list with → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/del#py-del-list[`del(lst[ix])`].
