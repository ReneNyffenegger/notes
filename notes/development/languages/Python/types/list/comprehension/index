$ Python: list comprehension

code {
result = [ expr(x) → development/languages/Python/statements/for#py-for-in-list[for x in someList] ]
result = [ expr(x) → development/languages/Python/statements/for#py-for-in-list[for x in someList] if criterion(x)]
code }

A list comprehension evaluates an expression whose value is dependent on each element in a list. Additionally, it can be augmented with a criterion that determines if an expression is to be evaluated for an element.

{ Calculating squares of a list

  This is demonstrated with the following simple example. The expression that is caluclated is `i**2` which is evaluted for each `i` in the given list (which consists 2, 4, 5 and 7).

  Compare with `map(lambda i: i**2, [2,4,5,7])`

}
{ Using a criterion

  The following example calculates the square roots of numbers with `math.sqrt`. Since `math.sqrt` throws a *ValueError* for negative numbers, the optional `if` part of the list comprehension
  is used to only calculate square roots for `x >= 0`.
