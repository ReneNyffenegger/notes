$ Python type: Ellipsis
@ Ellipsis

The `Ellipsis` type has one single value which has two representations: `...` and `Ellipsis`.

Why lower and uppercase?
code {
>>> → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/type(Ellipsis)
<class 'ellipsis'>
code }

`...` is also an `ellipsis`:
code {
>>> type(...)
<class 'ellipsis'>
code }
