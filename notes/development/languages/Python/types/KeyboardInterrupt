$ Python type: KeyboardInterrupt
@ KeyboardInterrupt

`KeyboardInterrupt` inherits from `BaseException`

The following script prints a number in the range from 0 through 99999 every second.
-
Pressing `ctrl+c` prints the current time and continues printing the numbers.
-
Pressing `ctrl+c` twice within a second exits the script:
code {
→ development/languages/Python/statements/import → development/languages/Python/standard-library/time
from → development/languages/Python/standard-library/datetime import datetime

→ development/languages/Python/statements/try:
   for i in → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/range(100000):
      try:
         → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/print(i)
         time.sleep(1)
      except KeyboardInterrupt as k:
         print(datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
         time.sleep(1)
      
except KeyboardInterrupt:
   print('exiting')
code }
