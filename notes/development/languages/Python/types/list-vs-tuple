$ Python: list vs tuple

→ development/languages/Python/types/tuple[Tuples] are immutable, → development/languages/Python/types/list[lists] are mutable.
(That is, once a tuple is created, its not possible to add or replace elements in it.)
-
Because a → development/languages/Python/types/dict only allows immutable objects as keys, a list cannot be used as a key in a dict. (In order for an object
to be used as a key in a dict, the object needs to be *hashable*, that is: → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/hash[`hash(obj)`] needs to be defined).

Typically, tuples are used in a similar fashion like a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/language/struct[C `struct`] with a predefined number of elements and types.
-
Lists on the other hand are often used like arrays with a varying number of elements.
