$ Python: tuple
@ tuple

A *tuple*  is an *immutable* → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence type. It stores references to → development/languages/Python/objects[objects] which also makes it a
→ development/languages/Python/objects/containers.

{ Creating tuples #py-tuple-create

  A tuple is created from a sequence of expressions that are separated by commas.
code {
tup = 4 * 2, 'foo', None
code }

  A trailing comma is permitted:
code {
tup = 'one', 2, ['*', '*', '*'],
code }

  In order to create an empty tuple, empty parantheses are required:
code {
tup = ()
code }

  In order to create an empty tuple, empty parantheses are required:

  In order to create a tuple with *one single* element, either the parantheses or the trailing comma is required:
code {
t1 = ( 42 )
T1 =   42 ,
code }

  The following simple Python script creates a few tuples and uses → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/isinstance[`isinstance()` to verify that the → development/languages/Python/objects[objects] are indeed tuples:
  gh|about-Python|/types/tuple/create.py||

  Note, the `var1, var2, var3` is used for a different purpose in → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence#py-sequence-unpacking[sequence unpacking].

}
{ Creating a tuple from a string #py-tuple-create-from-string

  When a tuple is created from a → development/languages/Python/types/string[string], the characters of the string become the elements in the tuple:
  gh|about-Python|/types/tuple/create-from-string.py||

  This is because a string is an → development/languages/Python/iterable[iterable] and the tuple's constructor constructs the tuple from the elements that an iterable returns.
  
  The same is also the case for ⇒ → development/languages/Python/types/list#py-liset-create-from-string[list].
