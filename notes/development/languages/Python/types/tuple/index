A *tuple*  is a → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence type.

{ Creating a tuple from a string #py-tuple-create-from-string

  When a tuple is created from a → development/languages/Python/types/string[string], the characters of the string become the elements in the tuple:
  gh|about-Python|/types/tuple/create-from-string.py||

  This is because a string is an → development/languages/Python/iterable[iterable] and the tuple's constructor constructs the tuple from the elements that an iterable returns.
  
  The same is also the case for ⇒ → development/languages/Python/types/list#py-liset-create-from-string[list].
