$ Python: string.rstrip()

`rstrip(char_set)` removes all characters in `char_set` from the right side of a string:

A specific use of `rstrip` is to remove → development/line-break[line breaks] from a string's end: `rstrip('\n\r')`. This is especially useful when the strings are read by
→ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/open/iterate-over-each-line-in-file[iterating over each line in a file]. This somewhat imitates the
→ development/languages/Perl/functions/chomp[`chomp()` function in Perl].

sa:

  The last n characters can be removed from a string with `str = str[:-n]` (See → development/languages/Python/types/string/substring[extracting substrings from strings]).
