$ Python: taking substrings from a string

A substring can be extracted from a string with brackets. The characters are zero-indexed, so `text[n]` gets the character at position n+1.

The optional second number (after the colon) is exclusively, so `text[n:m]` gets the characters at position n+1 through m.

If the numbers are negative, they count from the end of the string towards the beginning.
