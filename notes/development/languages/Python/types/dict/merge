$ Python: merge two dictionaries

The following example tries to demonstrate how two → development/languages/Python/types/dict[dictionaries] can be merged.
gh|about-python|/types/dict/merge.py||

When executed, this script prints:
code {
x = eggs
y = why
num = 42
hello = world
code }


Note, the value of the `num` key of `dict_2` has overwritten the corresponding value of `dict_1`.

sa:

  The → development/languages/Python/types/dict/update[`update()`] method of a `dict` updates a `dict` with the key/value pairs of another `dict`.

  → development/languages/Python/statements/def#py-def-two-stars[Arguments in `def` with two stars]
