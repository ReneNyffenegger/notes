$ Python: dict
@ dict

{ Check if a given key exists

  The `in` operator returns true if a given key exists in a dictionary and false otherwise:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/check-if-key-exists.py||

}
{ Getting keys of a dictionary

  `keys()` returns a list that contains a dictionary's keys:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/keys.py||

}
{ Getting keys and values of a dictionary

  `items()` can be used to extract both keys and values from a dictionary:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/items.py||

}
{ Misc

  Although `dict` provides `__getitem__()` and `__len__()`, it is considered to be a *mapping* rather than a sequence.
