{ Creating a dict

  A dictionary can be created with *curly braces* that contain the items.
  -
  The items are seperated by commas.
  -
  Each item consists of the key separated from the value by a colon (`:`):
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/create-curly-braces.py||

  A dict can be created from a → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence whose items are sequences themselves that provide the key/value pairs.
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/create-from-sequence.py||

  If the keys are → development/languages/Python/types/string[strings], a dict can be with *keyword arguments*:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/create-keyword-arguments.py||

  A dict can also be created with a → #py-dict-comprehension[dict comprehension].

}
{ A dict is a mapping, not a sequence

  Although a dict implements
  → development/languages/Python/dunders/__getitem__[`__getitem__()`] and → development/languages/Python/dunders/__len__[`__len__()`], it is considered a mapping type rather than a
  → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence type.

  This is because the items a dict contains are looked up with immutable keys rather than integers.

}
{ Check if a given key exists

  The `in` operator returns true if a given key exists in a dictionary and false otherwise:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/check-if-key-exists.py||

}
{ Getting keys of a dictionary

 `keys()` returns a → development/languages/Python/types/list that contains a dictionary's keys:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/keys.py||

 `list()` also returns a list of the dictionary's keys. The returned list is ordered according to the insertion of the elements into the dictionary:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/list.py||

}
{ Getting keys and values of a dictionary

 `items()` can be used to iterate over keys and values from a dictionary:
  gh|about-python|/types/dict/items.py||

}
{ Removing keys from a dict

  A key/value pair can be removed from a dict with → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/del#py-del-list[`del(dct[ix])`].

}
{ Allowed key types

  A dict only allows immutable objects as keys.
  -
  Therefore, → development/languages/Python/types/tuple[tuples] are allowed as keys, but not → development/languages/Python/types/list[lists].

  Using a tuple as a key:
code {
>>> x = {(1,2,3): 'foo'}
>>> x[(1,2,3)]
'foo'
code }
  
  Trying to use a list as a key:
code {
>>> y = {[1,2,3]: 'bar'}
…
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
code }

}
{ Dict comprehension #py-dict-comprehension

  A dictionary can be created with a *dict comprehension*.

  gh|about-python|/types/dict/comprehension.py||

  Compare with → development/languages/Python/types/list/comprehension[list comprehensions].

}
{ Implementation of dicts

  A dict is implemented as a resizable hash table which is claimed to have better performance than a B-tree when looking up elements. In fact,
  this takes a constant time: `O(1)`.

}
{ Misc

  Although `dict` provides → development/languages/Python/dunders/__getitem__[`__getitem__()`] and
  → development/languages/Python/dunders/__len__[`__len__()`], it is considered to be a *mapping* rather than a sequence.

  → development/languages/Python/standard-library/collections/OrderedDict[`collections.OrderedDict`] is a subclass of `dict` that remembers in what order its entries were added.
  -
  `collections.defaultdict` is a subclass of `dict` that calls a factory function to supply missing values
