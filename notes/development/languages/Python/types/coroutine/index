$ Python: coroutine (type)
@ coroutine

A coroutine object is created when a function declared with `→ development/languages/Python/statements/def/async` is called:
code {
import → development/languages/Python/standard-library/asyncio

→ development/languages/Python/statements/def/async coro_func(): pass

coro_obj = coro_func()

→ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/print(→ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/type(coro_obj)) # <class 'coroutine'>

→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/asyncio/run[asyncio.run](coro_obj)
code }
