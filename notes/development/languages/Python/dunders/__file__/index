$ Python: __file__

`__file__` evaluates to the filename, inclusive path, that a → development/languages/Python/module was loaded from.
(Not all modules are required to have a `__file__` attribute, see → development/languages/Python/PEP[PEP] 420 for more details).

In a script, `__file__` is filename as it was used on the command line (relative or absolute).

{ Simple demonstration

  The evaluation of `__file__` is demonstrated with the following simple Python script (`script.py`) and → development/languages/Python/module (`XYZ.py`) that the script loads:

  gh|about-Python|/dunders/__file__/script.py||

  gh|about-Python|/dunders/__file__/XYZ.py||

  When executed like so …
code {
P:\ath\to> → Windows/dirs/Windows/py_exe[py] example\script.py
code }
  … the following is printed:
code {
XYZ is implemented in  p:\ath\to\example\XYZ.py
This script is:        example\script.py
XYZ was imported from: p:\ath\to\example\XYZ.py
code }

}
