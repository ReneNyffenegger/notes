$ Python: __debug__

By default, `__debug__` is set to `True`. It can be set to `False` by invoking the Python interpreter with `-O`.

The value of `__debug__` cannot be changed while Python is running.

sa:
  If `__debug__` is `False`, â†’ development/languages/Python/statements/assert[`assert` statements] do nothing.
