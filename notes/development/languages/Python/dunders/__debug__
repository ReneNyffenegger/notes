$ Python: __debug__

By default, `__debug__` is set to `True`. It can be set to `False` by invoking the Python interpreter with `-O`.

An â†’ development/languages/Python/statements/assert[`assert`] statement is only executed when `__debug__` is `True`.

The value of `__debug__` cannot be changed while Python is running.
