$ Python: __del__
@ __del__

An  object's → development/languages/Python/dunders[dunder] method `__del__()` is reached when this → development/languages/Python/objects[object's]
→ development/languages/Python/objects/reference-counter is about to reach zero.
-
The following example tries to demonstrate this:
gh|about-Python|/dunders/__del__.py||

When executed, the script prints:
code {
CLS.__init__() was called for ident = obj
Calling F
entering F
CLS.__init__() was called for ident = F
leaving F
CLS.__del__() was called for ident = F
returned from F
calling del(obj_ref_1)
returned from del(obj_ref_1), calling del(obj_ref_2)
CLS.__del__() was called for ident = obj
returned from del(obj_ref_2)
code }

{ Misc

  If `__del__()` raises an exception, warning message is printed to `sys.stderr`.

}
