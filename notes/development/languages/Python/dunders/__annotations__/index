$ Python: __annotations__
@ __annotations__

`__annotations__` is a → development/languages/Python/types/dict[`dict`] that provides some annotations about global(?) → development/languages/Python/variables[variables], → development/languages/Python/class[classes], class attributes,
→ development/languages/Python/functions[function] parameters and return types.

`__annotations__` is one of the names that is present in the top level scope (`→ development/languages/Python/dunders/__name__[__name__] == '__main__'`) as returned by → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/dir[`dir()`].

{ Supplying a function with an annotation about its return type

  The special syntax `→ development/languages/Python/statements/def[def] funcName() -> → development/languages/Python/types[type]` adds the key `'return'` to the `__annotations__` dictionary. The value for this key is
  the specified → development/languages/Python/types[type]:
  gh|about-Python|/dunders/__annotations__/def-1.py||

  It should be noted that the annotated type is not enforced at runtime:
  gh|about-Python|/dunders/__annotations__/def-2.py||

}
{ Supplying annotations about a function parameter #py-__annotation__-param

  A → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[function parameter] is annotated with a colon (`:`) followed by the annotation.
  gh|about-Python|/dunders/__annotations__/def-param.py||
