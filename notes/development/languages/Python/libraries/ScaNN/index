$ Python library: ScaNN

We create 3 million vectors.
-
1 million is centered around `(1, 0, 0)`, 1 million around `(0, 1, 0)` and 1 million around `(0, 0, 1)`:

We additionially create 10000 vectors that are centered around `(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)`. The goal of this example is to find these vectors (which is why they're called *needles* here):

The vectors are combined and randomly shuffled:
