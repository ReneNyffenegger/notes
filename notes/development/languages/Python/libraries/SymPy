$ Python library: SymPy

SymPy is a Python library, written entirely in Python, for symbolic mathematics whose goal is to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS).

{ Example: Differentiation of a polynomial function

  The following function differentiates the polynomial axÂ²+bx+c. When run, it prints `2*a*x + b`.

code {
import sympy

x, a, b, c = sympy.symbols('x a b c')
f = a * x**2 + b * x + c
dfdx = sympy.diff(f, x)
print(dfdx)
code }

}
