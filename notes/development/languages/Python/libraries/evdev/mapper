$ Python: Mapping my keyboard with evdev

This is a simple python script using the `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/evdev` library to
  • Switch `caps` with `escape`
  • Enter the umlauts `ä`, `ö` and `ü` with `left-alt` + `;`, `'` and `[` respectively.

{ Installing

  This script installs the keyboard layout remapper:
    • Create and active the Python virtual environment in the directory `virt-env`
    • Install the Python package → development/languages/Python/libraries/evdev.
    • Add the `uinput` group
    • Write the `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev/rules_d[/etc/udev/rules.d]/99-input.rules` file
    • Add the current user to the `input` and `uinput` group
    • Write the file → Linux/fhs/home/username/_config/autostart#config-autostart-desktop[`evdev.desktop`] in the directory `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_config/autostart` which stats the shell script `start`.

{ Source code (go.py)

 `go.py` is the Python script that does the re-mapping of the keyboard:
  gh|py-evdev-mapping|/go.py||

}
{ shell script: start

 `start` is the → Linux/shell/script[shell script] that activates the virtual environment into which `evdev` is installed and then starts `go.py`.

{ TODO

  Can `→ Linux/shell/commands/wmctrl -l -p` somehow be used to identify the → Linux/kernel/process which caused an event?

  → https://github.com/chrippa/ds4drv/issues/93#issuecomment-265300511[This link] gave the correct instructions on how to set the `→ Linux/fhs/dev/uinput` to permission `0660` and its group to `uinput`, but see

  I needed to write into `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_config/autostart[~/.config/autostart]/evdev.desktop` so that the keyboard mapper is started automatically.
