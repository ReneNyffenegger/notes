$ Python: Mapping my keyboard with evdev

This is a simple python script using the `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/evdev` library to
  • Switch `caps` with `escape`
  • Enter the umlauts `ä`, `ö` and `ü` with `left-alt` + `;`, `'` and `[` respectively.

{ Installing

  This script installs the keyboard layout remapper:
  gh|py-evdev-mapping|/_install||

}
{ Source code (go.py)

 `go.py` is the Python script that does the re-mapping of the keyboard:
  gh|py-evdev-mapping|/go.py||

}
{ shell script: start

 `start` is the → Linux/shell/script[shell script] that activates the virtual environment into which `evdev` is installed and then starts `go.py`.

  gh|py-evdev-mapping|/start||

}

  also → https://www.coderancher.us/2023/04/28/how-to-allow-users-access-to-virtual-devices/[this link].

  I needed to write into `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_config/autostart[~/.config/autostart]/evdev.desktop` so that the keyboard mapper is started automatically.
