$ Python library: pylab

The â†’ development/languages/Python/libraries/matplotlib documentation has the following *warning* on using `pylab`.
"
  Since heavily importing into the global namespace may result in unexpected behavior,
  the use of pylab is strongly discouraged. Use matplotlib.pyplot instead.
