$ Python library Lark: rules

{ Rules that start with a question mark

  A rule that starts with a question mark is «inlined» if the rule expands to a single child.

  The following example tries to demonstrate the difference between a «normal» rule and a rule that starts with a question mark:

  gh|about-Python|/libraries/Lark/rules/question-mark.py||

  When parsing the input `foo bar (baz)`, the first grammar (where `rul` is without question mark), prints
code {
Tree with name rul
   foo
   bar
Tree with name rul
   baz
code }

  The second grammar (using `?rul`) prints
code {
Tree with name rul
   foo
   bar
Token with value baz
code }

  More about the question mark in Larks documentation: → https://github.com/lark-parser/lark/blob/master/docs/tree_construction.md#shaping-the-tree[Shaping the tree] (from where
  this example is basically copied).
