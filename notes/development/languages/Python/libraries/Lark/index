$ Python library: Lark

Lark implements the → https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Earley_parser[Earley parser] algorithm, thus it is able to parse *all* context-free grammars. In addition, Lark supports
*scannerless mode*, so terminals (tokens) can be resolved at parse time.

Terminals are represented by uppercase names.

In a grammar, comments can be introduced with a double slash (`//`).

{ Ignoring white space

  Many programming languages ignore white space. So, we define the token(?) `WS` and the rule `whitespace` that consists of zero or more `WS`:

}
{ Ignoring white space (%ignore)

  Because most programming languages (except for example → development/languages/Python …) ignore white space, *Lark* allows to ignore them with the special keyword `%ignore`:

}
{ Importing WS (%import common.WS)

  Because white space play such a fundamental role, Lark allows to import their definition with
 `%import common.WS` and then use their definition to ignore them with `%ignore WS`:
