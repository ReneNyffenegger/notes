$ Python library: Lark

Lark implements the â†’ https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Earley_parser[Earley parser] algorithm, thus it is able to parse *all* context-free grammars. In addition, Lark supports
*scannerless mode*, so terminals (tokens) can be resolved at parse time.

Terminals are represented by uppercase names.

In a grammer, comments can be introduced with a double slash (`//`).
