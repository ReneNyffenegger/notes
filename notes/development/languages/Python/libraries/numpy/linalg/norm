$ numpy.linalg.norm()

Calculate the *length of a vector*:
code {
→ development/languages/Python/statements/import → development/languages/Python/libraries/numpy as np

vec     = np.array([ 3, 4, 0 ])
vec_len = → development/languages/Python/libraries/numpy/linalg[np.linalg].norm(vec)
→ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/print(vec_len)                      # prints 5.0
code }
