{ Installation on Windows

  requests must apperantly (at least on my machine) be installed as admin.

  As *non-admin*:
code {
>  pip install requests
…
… Rödel rödel rödel
…
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: 'C:\\Python311\\Scripts\\normalizer.exe' -> 'C:\\Python311\\Scripts\\normalizer.exe.deleteme'
code }


  When I tried to install this library on Windows under username `René` (note the accent), I received a `UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 57: ordinal not in range(128)`.
  -
  I was able to fix this by changing the → Windows/development/environment-variables/USERNAME[environment variable `USERNAME`] to a value without accent.
