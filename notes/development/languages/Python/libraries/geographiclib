$ Python library: geographiclib

`geographiclib` is a Python implementation of the geodesic functions offered in → https://github.com/geographiclib/geographiclib[GeographicLib], a C++ library for
  • geodesic and rhumb line calculations
  • conversions between geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates;
  • gravity (e.g., EGM2008) and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2020) calculations.

It's not clear to me if the Python implementation has exactly the same functionality as the C++ origin.
