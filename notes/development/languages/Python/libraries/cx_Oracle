$ Python library: cx_Oracle
@ cx_Oracle

*cx_Oracle* is a → development/languages/Python/PEP/0249[PEP 249] conformant library that enables Python scripts to access Oracle databases.

In the May 2022 release, cx_Oracle was renamed to → development/languages/Python/libraries/python-oracledb (for example, because cx has nothing to do with → https://www.oracle.com/cx/[Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX)] or to better align
with the name of the → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js node-oracledb driver).
