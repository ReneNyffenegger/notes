$ Python library: cx_Oracle
@ cx_Oracle

*cx_Oracle* is a → development/languages/Python/PEP/0249[PEP 249] conformant library that enables Python scripts to access Oracle databases.

In the May 2022 release, cx_Oracle was renamed to → development/languages/Python/libraries/python-oracledb[`python-oracledb`] (for example,
because cx has nothing to do with → https://www.oracle.com/cx/[Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX)] or to better align
with the name of the → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js node-oracledb driver).
-
However, it seems that there is no `python-oracledb` for Python 3.6 or earlier available on PyPI, so in outdated Python environments, `cx_Oracle` might still be useful.

{ Cursor attribute

  The `cursor` object of `cx_Oracle` defines some attributes in addition to
  those specified in → development/languages/Python/PEP/0249#py-sqlite-cursor-obj[those specified in PEP 249]:
  table { ll

    `bindnames` ☰
    `bindvars` ☰
    `callfunc` ☰
    `callproc` ☰ also in PEP
    `close` ☰
    `connection` ☰ also in PEP

{ Demonstration

  Connecting with a *proxy user*, i. e. without password:
code {
import cx_Oracle as cxora
con = cxora.connect(user='[rene]', dsn='db')
print("Database version:", con.version)
print("Current schema:  ", con.current_schema)
print("Internal name:   ", con.internal_name)
# print(dir(con))
code }

  Create a table. *Note*: `cursor()` is a method, not an attribute!
code {
con.cursor().execute('create table tq84_cx_Oracle(a number, b varchar2(20))')
code }

  Insert some values using named → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/statement/bind-variables[bind variables]:
code {
ins = con.cursor()

sql = 'insert into tq84_cx_Oracle values (:a, :b)'

ins.execute    (sql, dict(a=  42, b='Hello world') )

ins.executemany(sql,[dict(a=  99, b='Ninety-nine'),
                     dict(a=None, b='null'       ),
                     dict(a=  -1, b='minus one'  )])
code }

  Insert more values using positional bind variables:
code {
ins = con.cursor()
sql = 'insert into tq84_cx_Oracle values (:1, :2)'

ins.executemany(sql, [[1, 'one'  ],
                      [2, 'two'  ],
                      [3, 'three'],
                      [4, 'four' ],
                      [5, 'five' ]])
code }

  Commit the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/transaction:
code {
con.commit()
code }

  Select some values:
code {
sel = con.cursor()
sel.execute('select * from tq84_cx_Oracle where b like :b', b = '%i%')

for a, b in sel.fetchall():
    print(f'{a:>3} {b}')
code }

  Cleaning up:
code {
con.cursor().execute('drop table tq84_cx_Oracle')
con.close()
code }

}

sa:

  I once needed `cx_Oracle` to
    • → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/hist/_queries/statements-on-tables-in-given-schema#awr-extract-statements-py[extract SQL Statement from Oracle's AWR].
    • → development/languages/Python/libraries/cx_Oracle/execute-statement-on-many-dbs[find "`TMP`" tables in many databases]


  → development/languages/Python/libraries/cx_Oracle/SQLAlchemy[`cx_Oracle` and `sqlalchemy`]
