$ matplotlib.axes.Axes

A `matplotlib.axes.Axes` class is central to the matplotlib API because it defines the plotting area where data is drawn.

A `Axes` object has two (or sometimes three?) → development/languages/Python/libraries/matplotlib/axis/Axis[`matplotlib.axis.Axis`] (or more specifically
`matplotlib.axis.XAxis` and `matplotlib.axis.YAxis`) objects representing the x,y coordinates.
-
It's possible to attach more `Axis` objects to display additional data.

{ Current Axes #mpl-Axes-current

  In order to support pylab/pyplot state machine, a figure has a *current Axes*.

  The current Axes can be set or gotten with the → development/languages/Python/libraries/matplotlib/figure/Figure[`Figure`] methods `sca()` and `gca()`.
