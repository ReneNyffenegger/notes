$ Python library: pyexpander

{ Installing pyexpander

  In my case as *administrator* on → Windows:
code {
→ development/languages/Python/installation/directory/Scripts/pip install pyexpander
code }

  This also installs the `expander.py` script under → development/languages/Python/installation/directory/Scripts[`<inst-dir>/Scripts`].

}
{ Simple example

  Here's a file to be preprocessed (`test.txt`):
code {
first $py(num = 42) line
second $py(txt = 'Hello world') line

This is the fourth line in the output.

The number is $(num) and the text is $(txt).
code }

  This file can now be preprocessed to → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdout] with
code {
C:\users\rene> expander test.txt
code }

  This command prints
code {
first  line
second  line

This is the fourth line in the output.

The number is 42 and the text is Hello world.
code }

}
