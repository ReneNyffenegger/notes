$ torch.nn.Sequential

Instances of `torch.nn.Sequential` are  *container* that store an *ordered* set of (sub-)modules.
-
The `forward()` method of `torch.nn.Sequential()` passes its argument to the first submodule, then passes the submodules output to the second submodule etc. and finally returns the output of the last submodule.

`torch.nn.Sequential` inherits from `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/torch/types/nn/Module`.
