$ torch.nn.Module

`torch.nn.Module` is the base class for all → development/Data/science/Machine-learning/neural-networks modules.

{ Parameters and state_dict #torch-module-state_dict

  A module's learnable parameters (i.e. weights and biases) can be accessed with the model's `.parameters()` method (which returns a generator object).

 `state_dict` is a dictionary that maps each layer to its parameter tensor and are typically used to
