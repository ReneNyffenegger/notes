$ Inherit from torch.nn.Module

The following simple script defines a class, `FWD`, which inherits from `→ development/languages/Python/libraries/torch/types/nn/Module`. The class implements one method only: `forward`.
-
Instances of classes that inherit from `nn.Module` (such as `fwd` in this script) are → development/languages/Python/objects/callable[callable]. When they're called (`fwd(…)`), under the hood,
the `forward` method gets invoked.
code {
import torch

class FWD(torch.nn.Module):

  def forward(self, x):
      print(f'forward, x = {x}')
      return x*2


fwd = FWD()

tns = torch.tensor([
           [ 1, 3 ],
           [ 2, 4 ]
      ])

#
#  Verify existence of __call__ member (which makes an object callable):
#
print(fwd.__call__)

#
#  call object:
#
print(fwd(tns))

code }
