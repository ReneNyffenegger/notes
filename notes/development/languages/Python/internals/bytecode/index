$ Python internals: bytecode
@ bytecode

sa:

  Python stores cached bytecode in `.pyc` files.

  The → development/languages/Python/CPython#py-gil[Global Interpreter Lock] makes sure that at any given time only one thread executes bytecode.

  The → development/languages/Python/standard-library module → development/languages/Python/standard-library/dis[`dis`] is a *disassembler* for bytecode.

  The source file `→ development/languages/Python/CPython/sources/Python/ceval_c`.
