$ Python: generators
-

A generator is used to create an → development/languages/Python/iterators[iterator]. That is, a generator creates the
`__iter__` and `__next__` methods and raises the `StopIteration` exception automatically behind the scenes.

In order to define a generator function, the → development/languages/Python/statements/yield[`yield`] statement (or the equivalent(?) *yield expression*) is used.
