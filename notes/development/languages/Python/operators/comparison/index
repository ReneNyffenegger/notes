$ Python: comparison operators

Apparently, comparison operators are also called *relational operators*.

`==`

`!=`

`<>`

`>`

`<`

`>=`

`<=`

{ Comparision of user defined types

  Without implementing `__eq__`, `==` is always false in user defined types:
  gh|about-python|/operators/comparison/UDT-without-eq.py||


  In order to have a meaningful equality test of user defined types, the `__eq__` method needs to be implemented
  gh|about-python|/operators/comparison/UDT-with-eq.py||

}
