$ Python: comparison operators

Apparently, comparison operators are also called *relational operators*. These include:
  • `==`
  • `!=`
  • `<>`
  • `>`
  • `<`
  • `>=`
  • `<=`

{ Chaining comparison operators

  Comparison operators can be chained:
  gh|about-python|/operators/comparison/chaining.py||

}
{ Comparing sequences

  → development/languages/Python/iterable/sequence[Sequences] can be compared. When sequences are compared, the interpreter compares the sequences' elements pairwise from left to right until it is clear what the comparison evaluates to.
  -
  If a compared element is a seqeunce itself, the comparison is done recursively.

  gh|about-python|/operators/comparison/sequence.py||

  It is not possible to compare a → development/languages/Python/types/list with a
  → development/languages/Python/types/tuple. This raises a `TypeError` exception (*'<' not supported between instances of 'tuple' and 'list'*)

}
{ Comparision of user defined types

  Without implementing `__eq__`, `==` is always false in user defined types:
  gh|about-python|/operators/comparison/UDT-without-eq.py||


  In order to have a meaningful equality test of user defined types, the `__eq__` method needs to be implemented
