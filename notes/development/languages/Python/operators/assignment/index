$ Python: assignment operators

`=`

`+=`

`-=`

`*=`

`/=`

`%=`

`**=`

`//=`  (aka floor division: The result of the floor division `12//5` is `2`).

The assignment operator does not copy → development/Data, it rather binds a name to an object. The assignment (but not the object) is deleted with the
→ development/languages/Python/statements/del[`del` statement].
