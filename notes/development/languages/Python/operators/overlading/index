$ Python: Operator overloding

Python allows to overload → development/languages/Python/operators.

An interesting example of an overloaded operator is found in the `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/pathlib` module: the division by operator (`/`) is used in this module to concatenate directories for path expressions:
code {
from pathlib import Path

homeDir = Path('/home/rene')
csvFile  = homeDir / 'examples' / 'data' / 'census.csv'

print(csvFile)  # /home/rene/examples/data/census.csv
code }
