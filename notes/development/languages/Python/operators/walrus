$ Python: walrus operator :=
@ walrus operator

`:=` is the so called *walrus operator*. This operator allows to assign the value of an expression to a variable *and* evaluate this value in a boolean context
(for example in an `→ development/languages/Python/statements/if` or `→ development/languages/Python/statements/while` statement):

code {
if val := funcXYZ():
   print(f'val = {val}')
code }

The valrus operator was introduced in Version 3.8.
