$ Python: literals

A numerical value can be represented in hexadecimal representation by prefixing it with `0x`
code {
>>> 0xdeadbeef
3735928559
code }

Similarly, a numerical value can also be represented as in ocal representation by prefixing it with `0o` (the first character is a zero, the second one an upper or lowercase `o`).
code {
>>> 0o777
511
code }

Even literals have an identity:
code {
>>> â†’ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/id[id](42)
140707326270400
code }
