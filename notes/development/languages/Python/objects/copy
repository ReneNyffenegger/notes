$ Python: copying objects

The assignment operator does not create a new → development/languages/Python/objects, it merly makes the → development/languages/Python/variables on its left side reference the object that is referenced by the expression on its right side.

This page tries to show some tecniques how objects can be copied.

{ Copying a sequence

  A sequence can be copied by *slicing* it:
  gh|about-Python|/objects/copy/sequence.py||

}
{ Copying a dictionary #py-copy-dict

  A → development/languages/Python/types/dict has the `.copy()` method:
  gh|about-Python|/objects/copy/sequence.py||

}
