$ Python objects: reference counter
@ reference counter

The value of an → development/languages/Python/objects[object's] reference counter can be determined with
→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys/getrefcount[`sys.getrefcount(obj)`].

When an object's reference counter reaches zero, the object's → development/languages/Python/dunders/__del__[`__del__()`] method is called.

The module → development/languages/Python/standard-library/weakref allows to point to objects without incrementing their reference counter.
