$ Python: Awaitable objects
@ awaitable object

An *awaitable object* can be used in `await` expressions.

There are three main types of awaitable objects:
  • a coroutine object (a function defined with `async def` or an → development/languages/Python/types/coroutine[object returned by a coroutine function])
  • a `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/asyncio/Future` 
  • a `Task` object

Objects witha an `__await__()` method are also awaitable objects.

sa:

 `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/asyncio/gather(*aws, ‥)` runs the awaitable objects of `aws` concurrently.
