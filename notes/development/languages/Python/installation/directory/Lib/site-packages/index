$ Python installation directory Lib/site-packages

`Lib/site-packages`, located under the → development/languages/Python/installation/directory[Python root installation directory], contains *third party library modules*.

Apparently, installing a → development/languages/Python/module with → development/languages/Python/installation/directory/Scripts/pip[`pip`], causes the package to be
installed under `<PY-INSTALL-DIR>/Lib/site-packages`.

The paths of these modules is added to the *module search path* by the script (module?) → development/languages/Python/installation/directory/Lib/site_py[`Lib/site.py`].
