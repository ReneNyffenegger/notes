$ Python: Download and install a wheel

The following example demonstrates how a specific → development/languages/Python#py-wheel[wheel] can be downloaded and then be installed separately with → development/languages/Python/installation/directory/Scripts/pip.

First, we need to determine the URL of the wheel we want to download from → development/languages/Python#py-pypi[PyPI]. For the bottle package, this is
→ https://pypi.org/project/bottle/#files

Then, the process is relatively straight forward:
code {
$pkgUrl    = …

$pw        = convertTo-SecureString "theSecret" -asPlainText -force
$proxyCred = new-object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentList "domainxyz\rene", $pw

invoke-webRequest $pkgUrl -proxy $proxyUrl -proxyCredential $proxyCred -out $env:temp/bottle-0.12.25-py3-none-any.whl

pip install $env:temp\bottle-0.12.25-py3-none-any.whl
code }
