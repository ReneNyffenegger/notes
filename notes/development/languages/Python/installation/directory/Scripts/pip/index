$ Python: pip

`pip` (or `pip.exe`) stands for *Python installs packages*, however it is also used to upgrade und remove packages.

When installing packages, these are found by default on the → https://pypi.org[Python Package Index `pypi.org`].

{ Searching for a package

  It's possible to search for packages on the command line…
code {
pip search bible
code }

  … or using a development/web/browser the on https://pypi.org[`pypi.org`].


}
{ Installing a package

code {
pip install package-name
code }

  The name of the package can be followed by two equal signs and a version number to install a specific version:
code {
pip install package-name==1.2.3
code }

}
{ Upgrading a package to the newest version

code {
pip install --upgrade package-name
code }

  Apparently, `pip` itself can be upgraded like so:
code {
python development/languages/Python/import-system/minus-m[-m] pip install --upgrade pip
code }

}
{ Show installed packages

code {
pip list
code }

}
{ Upgrading pip itself

  pip itself (not a package) can be upgraded like so
code {
python → development/languages/Python/import-system/minus-m[-m] pip install --upgrade pip
code }

}
