sa:

  The → development/languages/Python/CPython#py-gil[global interpreter lock] makes sure that only one thread runds in the Python virtual machine.

 `sys.setswitchinterval()` determines how frequently Python's virtual machine switches between threads.

  The Python tutorial → https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html#multi-threading[recommends to use] the → development/languages/Python/standard-library/queue[`queue`] module for inter-thread communication and coordination.
