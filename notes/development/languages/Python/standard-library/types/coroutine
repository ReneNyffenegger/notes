$ Python: types.coroutine

`types.coroutine(fn)` converts regular generator functions to coroutines and thus allows interoperability between existing *generator-based coroutines* in `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/asyncio` and *native coroutines introduced by → development/languages/Python/PEP[PEP] 492.

`callable(fn)` must return `True`.

If `fn` is a *generator function*, the function applies the `CO_ITERABLE_COROUTINE` flag to `fn` which makes it a *coroutine* object.

Otherwise, it will be wrapped.
