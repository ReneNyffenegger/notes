$ Python: functools.partial
@ functools.partial

`partial(func)` creates a *partial object* from the → development/languages/Python/functions[function] `func`. Such a partial object has already pre-bound some of
the → development/languages/Python/functions/parameters[function's parameters to arguments]. These pre-bound values will then be used when the function will be
called with the partial object.
