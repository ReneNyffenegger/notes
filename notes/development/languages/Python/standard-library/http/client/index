$ Python standard library: http.client
@ http.client

{ http.client.HTTPMessage #py-stdlib-http-client-HTTPMessage

 `http.client.HTTPMessage` derives from `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/email/message#py-stdlib-email-message-Message`
  and adds (as far as I can see) the function `getallmatchingheaders()`.

  See also `http.client.HTTPResponse.msg` and `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.headers`.
