$ Python - importlib

importlib

{ Importing a module from an arbitrary path

  The module to be imported is located in an arbitary directory, for example in `../dir-module`. The name of the
  module is `FooModule.py`. It has only one function: `print_somthing()`.

  The script that wants to import this module uses `importlib.util` to locate and import the module:
