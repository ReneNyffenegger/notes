$ Python - venv
@ venv

The `venv` module can be used to create *virtual Python environments*. Such a virtual environment exists in a directory.


{ Creating a virtual environment

  A virtual environment (in the directory `theDirectory`) is created like so:
code {
python → development/languages/Python/import-system/minus-m[-m] venv theDirectory
code }

}
{ Activating a virtual environment

  Within the create directory tree is a script that can be called from the command line to activate a virtual environment. This script is located in the subidrectory `theDirectory/Scripts` and comes in multiple
  versions (→ Windows/PowerShell script, → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch file],  c-shell etc., is named `activate` and has the according → development/filename-extensions[filename suffix).

  After activating a virtual environment, the most imporatant effect seems to be that `theDirectory` and `theDirectory/lib/site-packages` are added to
  → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys#python-sys-path[`sys.path`]
