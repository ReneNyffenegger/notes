Python: asyncio.Future
@ asyncio.Future

`asyncio.Future` represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

`asyncio.Future` is not thread-safe.

`asyncio.Future` is an → development/languages/Python/objects/awaitable.

? An `asyncio.Future` object is bound to an *event loop*.

A `Future` class is similar to the one in PEP 3148 and *almost* compatible with `concurrent.future.Future` with the following differences:
  • `asyncio.Future` is not thread safe
  • `result()` and `exception()` do not take a timeout argument and rase an exception when the future isn't done yet
  • Callbacks registered with `add_done_callback()` are always called via the event loop's `call_soon()`.
  • This class is not compatible with the `wait()` and `as_completed()` methods of the `concurrent.futures` package.
  • `concurrent.futures.Future` instances cannot be awaited.
  • ‥ and more ‥

sa:

 `asyncio.isfuture(obj)` returns `True` if `obj` is either an instance of `asyncio.Future` or `asyncio.Task` or a Future-like object with a `_asyncio_future_blocking` blocking attribute.
