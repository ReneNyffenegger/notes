*wsgiref* is the reference implementation for → development/languages/Python/PEP/3333[WSGI]

{ simple_server

  Among others, `wsgiref.simple_server` exports `WSGIServer` and `WSGIRequestHandler` which allow to test a WSGI appliction.

  In the following example, the WSGI application is implemented with the callable (function) `app`. The application simply writes the `Hello World!` followed by a line that reveals the value of the environment variable `PATH_INFO`:
code {
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from wsgiref.simple_server import WSGIServer, WSGIRequestHandler

def app(environ, start_response):

    start_response(
       '200 OK',
       [('→ development/web/HTTP/header/Content/Type[Content-Type]', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')]
    )

  #
  #  The application callable returns an iterable yielding zero or more bytestrings:
  #
    return [
       'Hello world!\n'                .encode('utf-8'),
      f'Serving {environ["PATH_INFO"]}'.encode('utf-8')
    ]


host = ''   # Localhost?
port = 1234

wsgiServer = WSGIServer( (host,port) , WSGIRequestHandler )
wsgiServer.set_app(app)
wsgiServer.serve_forever()
code }

}
