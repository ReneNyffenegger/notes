$ Python: ctypes.windll

Two interesting attributes of `ctypes.windll` are
  • `user32` (which seems to represent → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/user32_dll[`user32.dll`])
  • ``kernel32` (which seems to represent → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/kernel32_dll[`kernel32.dll`])

sa:

  The → development/languages/Python/code-snippets/Win-API#py-winapi-msgbox[MessageBox` example] demonstrates how it is possible to call the
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/user32_dll[`user32.dll`] from → development/languages/Python.
