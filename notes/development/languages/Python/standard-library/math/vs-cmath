$ Python library math vs cmath

The `â†’ development/languages/Python/standard-library/math` module consists mostly of thin wrappers around the platform C math library functions.
-
`cmath` provides a similar, but not identical, selection of functions which  always return complex numbers (but constants such as `e`, `pi` or `tau` are floats):
code {
>>> import cmath
>>> cmath.sqrt(4)
(2+0j)
>>> cmath.e
2.718281828459045
code }

With `math`, `sqrt(-1)` raises `ValueError` while `cmath` returns `i` (`1j`) for this expression.
