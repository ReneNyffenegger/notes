{ File objects #python-io-file-object

  Python deals with three kinds of file objects.
    • binary files
    • buffered binary files
    • text files
 
  The interfaces for these interfaces are defined in the `io` module.

  See also the → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/open[`open`] function.

{ StringIO #py-io-StringIO

  In → development/languages/Python, → development/languages/Python/types/string[strings] are immutable. So they cannot be modified in-place.

  However, with the `io` module, such an in-place modification can be simulated with `StringIO()`:

  This example is from the → https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-modify-a-string-in-place[Python FAQ].
