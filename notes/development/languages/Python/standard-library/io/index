{ File objects #python-io-file-object

  Python deals with three kinds of file objects.
    • binary files
    • buffered binary files
    • text files
 
  The interfaces for these interfaces are defined in the `io` module.

  See also the → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/open[`open`] function.

}
{ StringIO #py-io-StringIO

  In → development/languages/Python, → development/languages/Python/types/string[strings] are immutable. So they cannot be modified in-place.

  However, with the `io` module, such an in-place modification can be simulated with `StringIO()`:

  This example is from the → https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-modify-a-string-in-place[Python FAQ].

}
{ open #py-io-open

 `io.open()` is the same function as the built-in function → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/open#py-open-is-io-open[`open()`].

}
{ Slurp content of file into a variable

  The content of an entire file can easily be read into a variable with the following construct. `__file__` needs to be replaced with the filename to be read:
code {
with open (__file__, 'r') as f:
     text = f.read()

print(text)
code }

}
