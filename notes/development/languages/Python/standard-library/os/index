$ Python - os

{ Print environment variables

  The following script uses `os.environ` to print the → development/environment-variable[environment variables] that are defined in the current session.

  Because the `PATH` environment variable is somewhat special because it consists of multiple paths, the script uses → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys#python-sys-path[`sys.path`] to print the list of directories
  that are searched for when trying to → development/languages/Python/statements/import[import] a module.
