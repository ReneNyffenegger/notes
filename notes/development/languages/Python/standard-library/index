  { Battery included

    The standard-library is/are the batteries of the *battery included* philosophy of Python.

    Referring to the standard-library as «batteries» gave raise to naming PEP 594 «Removing dead batteries from the standard library».

{ TODO

  { Built-in libraries

   The tuple of of modules that are compiled into the Python interpreter can be obtained with the following snippet:
code {
→ development/languages/Python/statements/import → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys
for lib in (sorted(sys.builtin_module_names)): print(lib)
code }

  }

}

sa:

  Code in the standard library *must* adhere to → development/languages/Python/PEP[PEP] 8 (Style Guide for Python Code).

? The root directory of the standard library can be determined with `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys[sys].prefix`.
