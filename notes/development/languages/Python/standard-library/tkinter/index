$ Python standard library: tkinter
@ tkinter

`tkinter` allows to use the → development/languages/TCL[Tcl]/Tk GUI toolkit from → development/languages/Python.

Installing `tkinter` was especially helpful to me when using → development/languages/Python/libraries/matplotlib and/or pyplot when I had the
warning → development/languages/Python/libraries/matplotlib#matplitlib-is-currently-using-agg.

{ Installing tkinter

  Because `tkinter` relies on the Tcl/Tk toolkit, `tkinter` might not be installed together with a default Python installation, even though `tkinter` belongs to
  → development/languages/Python/standard-library[Python's standard library].

  → https://stackoverflow.com/a/25905642/180275[This Stackoverflow answer] and its comments suggest to install `tkinter` with something along the lines of:
  table { ll
     Apt based distros (Ubuntu, Debian) ☰ `→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt install -y python3-tk`
     Fedora ☰ `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
     macOS ☰ `brew install python-tk`
  table }

}
{ Checking if tkinter is properly installed

code {
$ python3 → development/languages/Python/import-system/minus-m[-m] tkinter
code }

}

sa:
  → development/languages/Python/libraries/wxPython[`wxPython`]
