$ Python: iterator
@ iterator

An iterator might be created by a → development/languages/Python/generators[generator], or functions like → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/map[`map`],
→ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/filter[`filter`] or
→ development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/iter[`iter`] and functions that use the → development/languages/Python/statements/yield[`yield` statement.].


{ Relation to iterables

  An iterator has an → development/languages/Python/dunders/__iter__[`__iter__`] and a
  → development/languages/Python/dunders/__next__[`__next__`] method.

  The presence of the `__iter__` method makes the iterator also an an → development/languages/Python/iterable[iterable]. However, an iterable is not necessarily an iterator.

  The built in function → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/iter[`iter`] and
  The built in function → development/languages/Python/built-in-functions/next[`next`].
