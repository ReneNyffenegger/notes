$ Python: sequence
@ sequence
 
An → development/languages/Python/objects that implements the two methods
→ development/languages/Python/dunders/__getitem__[`__getitem__()`] and → development/languages/Python/dunders/__len__[`__len__()`] is a sequence.

A sequence is a special kind of an → development/languages/Python/iterable.

Some built-in sequence types include
  • → development/languages/Python/types/list
  • → development/languages/Python/types/string
  • → development/languages/Python/types/tuple
  • → development/languages/Python/types/bytes

Although → development/languages/Python/types/dict also implements `__getitem__` and `__len__`, it is considered to be *mapping* rather than an sequence because the elements a dict contains are looked up with
immutable keys rather than just integers.

{ Evaluating an expression on each element in a sequence

  In order to evalute an expression on each element of a sequence, a so-called → development/languages/Python/types/list/comprehension can be used.
