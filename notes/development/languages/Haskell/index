`"abc"` is syntactic sugar for `'a': 'b': 'c': []`

`a:b:c:d` is shorthand for `a:b:(c:d)`

{ Pattern matching

  Values are pattern matched («deconstructed») by writing however they were constructed.

code {
let (x, y, z) = (42, 99, 7) in …
let (char1:char_2:char3:[]) = "abc" in …
code }
--
   Use underscore for 'throw away' values:
code {
let (first_char:_:_:[]) = "abc" in first_char
code }

}
