{ Some functions

  { gets / fgets

    `gets()` reads a line, terminated by a new line or EOF. For this reason, `gets` should almost never be used because in normal circustances, it's impossible to know in advance
    how long the line will be.

    `fgets()` reads from a file rather than from stdin and allows to specify the maximum amount to be read.

  }

  { printf family #printf-family

    The complement to the printf family is the → #scanf-family.


  }

  { scanf family #scanf-family

    The scanf family is the complement to the → #printf-family. It decomposes a string into parts and assigns the values of these parts to variables.

  }
