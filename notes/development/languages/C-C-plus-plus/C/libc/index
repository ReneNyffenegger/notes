  With the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/stdarg_h[`<stdarg.h>`] include file, it is possible to access variadic arguments in functions.

  { gets / fgets #libc-gets-fgets

    `gets()` reads a line, terminated by a new line or EOF. For this reason, `gets` should almost never be used because in normal circustances, it's impossible to know in advance
    how long the line will be.

    `fgets()` reads from a file rather than from → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdin] and allows to specify the maximum amount to be read.

{ include files

  { string.h

    *Reserved names*: Names that begin with `str`, `mem` or `wcs` and are followed by a lowercase letter are reserved because they might be added in the declarations in the `<string.h>` header file.

  As per → https://stackoverflow.com/a/2120070/180275[this stackoverflow answer], → development/GNU[GNU's] libc (→ https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html[glibc]) is → Linux[Linux] specific and won't work on → Windows.
