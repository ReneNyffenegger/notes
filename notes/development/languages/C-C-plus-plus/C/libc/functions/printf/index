$ libc: printf family

Apparently, with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/standards#c99, there is also a `snprintf` for *safe* string assembly.

The complement to the printf family is the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/functions/scanf[`scanf` family].

For `vsprintf`, see → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/stdarg_h/index.html#libc-stdarg-h-vsprintf[here].

{ Formatting Characters #printf-format-characters

  Some formatting characters for `printf` are demonstrated with the following simple program:
  gh|about-c|/datatypes/printf/characters.c||

  { Macros for format strings #printf-macros

  `PRI{fmt}{type}`

  `{fmt}` = 
    • `d` (decimal)
    • `i` (integer)
    • `o` (octal)
    • `u` (unsiged)
    • `x` (hexadecimal)

  `{type}` = 
    • `N`
    • `FASTN`
    • `LEASTN`
    • `PTR`
    • `MAX`

    Compare with the corresponding → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/functions/scanf#scanf-macros[`scanf` macros].

   → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C++] replacement for `sprintf`.
