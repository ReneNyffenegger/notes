$ libc: open / fopen

Interestingly, the → Linux/man-page[man page] for `open` is in the 2nd section while the man page for `fopen` is in the 3rd section.

{ open

  Note: `open()` needs the include file `<fcntl.h>`, but the corresponding `close()` needs `<unistd.h>`.

{ fopen #fopen

  `fopen` returns a pointer to a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/structs/FILE[`FILE` struct].
