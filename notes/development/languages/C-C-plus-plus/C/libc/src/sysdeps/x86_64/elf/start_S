$ sysdeps/x86_64/elf/start.S

This file contains → Linux/ELF[ELF] x86-64 ABI compliant startup code, notably the `_start` entry point which is found in the
→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file[object files] → Linux/fhs/usr/lib/crt1_o.

Part of this `_start` routine is to call `__libc_start_main` (defined in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/src/csu/libc-start_c) which in turn calls `main`.


The source file (→ http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/x86_64/elf/start.S;h=3c2caf9d00a0396ef2b74adb648f76c6c74ff65f;hb=cvs/glibc-2_9-branch) is well documented.
