$ tq84-tsearch.c (for platforms that don't have tsearch() etc.)

Apparently, the Windows compiler does not come with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/search/t[`tsearch()`] etc. The following two files can (hopefully) be used on such environments.

The file is basically a *copy & edit* from → https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html[glibc], version 2.29.

I also have renamed `tsearch()` to `tq84_tsearch()`, `tfind()` to `tq84_tfind()` etc. This to make sure that they don't accidentially interfere with a `<search.h>` implementation.

An example on how to use these functions can be found → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/search/t[here].
