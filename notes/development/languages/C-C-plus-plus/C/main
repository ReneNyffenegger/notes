  Is this still ISO?. → Linux/POSIX[POSIX.1] at least does not allow this.

code {
int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[]) { ...
code }

}

}

sa:
  In a → Windows C Run Time environment, `main` is called from → Windows/development/CRT/source/crt0_c[`crt.0`].

  → Linux/fhs/usr/lib/crt1_o[`/usr/lib/crt1.o`]

  The → Windows/development/CRT[Microsoft CRT] source file → Windows/development/CRT/source/stdargv_c[`stdargv.c`].
