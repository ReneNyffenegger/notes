$ C: memory allocation

In (pure) → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[c], there are two ways to allocate memory:
  • *Static allocation*: static and/or global variables - The size of the space is determined at compile time and allocated when the program is started.
  • *Automatic allocation*: allocated with *automatic variables* such as function arguments or local variables. (See → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/memory/stack[stack])

A third way to allocate memory is provided by the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/alloc[libc memory allocation functions].
