The calling convention states how arguments (parameters) are passed to a function and how the caller receives a return value. Amont others, the convention regulates if those values
are passed via CPU registers and/or via the stack and which registers are guaranteed to preserve their values accross function calls.

{ x68 calling conventions

  { stdcall #stdcall

    Function arguments are passed (pushed) from right to left. Stack is cleaned up by callee.

    Return value is passed through the `eax` register (→ development/languages/assembler/x86[x86 assembler]).

    Stdcall is the default calling convention for the 32-bit → Windows/development/WinAPI (after *pascal* was abandoned) and should apparently also be used
    for → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL/export-table[exported functions in DLLs].

    Stdcall is almost the same as cdecl with the exception that the callee resets `ESP` to the initial state with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/calling-convention[`ret x`] (instead of `ret`?). `x` = number of
    arguments * `sizeof(int)`.
code {
push arg3
push arg2
push arg1
call f

f:
  ; … do this , do that …
ret 12
code }

  }
  { cdecl #cdecl

    The default (native) calling convention for → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C and C++] programs. cdecl is short for → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[c] declaration.

    Caller pushes arguments on stack and cleans up stack.
    -
    Cleaning up the stack causes larger programs than those with stdcall.

    cdecl is required for variadic function arguments (vararg).

code {
→ development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/push[push] arg3  ; rightmost argument
→ development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/push[push] arg2
→ development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/push[push] arg1  ; leftmost argument
→ development/languages/assembler/x86/instructions/call[call] f
add esp, 12  ; 12 = 3 arguments each being 4 bytes
code }

   When entering the function (just after `call f` and before `add esp, 12`), the stack is:
   table { lll
      ☰  ☰ Notation in IDA
     ESP ☰ return address ☰
     ESP+4 ☰ arg1 ☰ `arg_0`
     ESP+8 ☰ arg2 ☰ `arg_1`
     ESP+12 ☰ arg3 ☰ `arg_2`
   table }


  }
  { fastcall

    Some values passed via registers

    The 64-bit WinAPI is similar to the 32-bit WinAPI fastcall. The first four parameters are passed in `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8` and `r9` (from right to left). Additional parameters are stored on the
    stack.

  }
  { pascal

    The pascal calling convention differs from stdcall in that the function arguments are pushed left to right.

  }
  { Name decoration #c-func-name-decoration

    Both, MSVC and → Windows/development/MinGW[MinGW] *decorate* stdcall and cdecl function names by prefixing them with an underscore.
    Additionally, stdcall function names will be followed by an at-sign and the number of bytes of the function parameters.

    Apparently, with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/linker/options/kill-at[linker option `--kill-at`], the suffixes are not created for stdcall DLL functions.
    -
    With → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/linker/options/add-stdcall-alias[`--add-stdcall-alias`], the function is exported with and without this suffix.

  }
}
{ x64 #call-conv-x64

  { Windows?

    Unlike the x86, on a x64, there is only *one* calling convention. It takes advantage of the increased number of → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[registers] that are available.

    The rules are
      • The first four integer or pointer parameters are passed in the `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8` and `r9` registers.
      • The first four floating-point parameters are passed in the first four SSE registers, `xmm0` - `xmm3`
      • The caller reserves space on the stack for arguments passed in registers. The called function can use this space to spill the contents of registers to the stack
      • Any additional arguments are passed on the stack
      • An integer or pointer return value is returned in the `rax` register; a → development/IEEE/754[floating-point] return value is returned in `xmm0`.
      • `rax`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8` through `r11`, `xmm0` through `xmm15`  are volatile
      • `rbx`, `rbp`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `rsp` and `r12` through `r15` are nonvolatile: these must be saved and restored by a function that uses them.

    In → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP, the `this` pointer is implicitely passed as *first argument*

  }
  { Linux

    Arguments are passed similarly to Windows x64, but using 6 registers instead of 4: `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8` and `r9`.

  }

}
{ Returning floats and doubles

  All calling conventions except Win64 retourn a float or a double in the `fpu` register `st(0)`.

  Win64 returns them in the low 32 or full 64 bits of the `xmm0` register.

}
