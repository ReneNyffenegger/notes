$ #pragma once

`#pragma once` is a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor] directive to make sure that a file is → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/include[included] at most once when compiling a translation unit.

`#ragma once` is not defined in the standard, but many compilers support it nevertheless.

A possible *caveat* of using `#pragma once` is that its not trivial to always identify the same file correctly when the file is referred to directly or via symbolic or hard links.
