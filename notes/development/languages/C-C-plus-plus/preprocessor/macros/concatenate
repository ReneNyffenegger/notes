$ Preprocessor: Concatenate words to single identifiers

The preprocessor directive `##` (two hashes or number signs, aka the *token pasting operator*) allows to concatenate two symbols into one.

The program prints:
code {
FooBar = 42
code }

It doesn't matter if spaces are to the left or right side of the hashes (`ident##other` is equal to `ident ## other`):
