$ Preprocessor: __VA_ARGS__ 

{ Simple example

  The following simple example uses `__VA_ARGS__` to create a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] that takes a variable number of arguments with the three dots.
  The variable number of arguments that are represented by the dots are passed to `__VA_ARGS__`:

{ Visual compiler (cl) vs Gnu compiler (gcc)

  The following file was preprocessed with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[Visual C compiler] (`cl → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/E-P-EP[/EP] basic`) and the
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[GNU compiler] (`gcc → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/x[-x] c → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[-E] → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/P_uppercase[-P] basic`)
  to deomonstrate a difference between their preprocessors.

  When using the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros/concatenate[token paste operator (`##`)], these differences go away:
