$ Predefined preprocessor macro __COUNTER__

`__COUNTER__` is a non-standard compiler extension for the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[GNU compiler]. Apparently, it's also implemented
in Microsoft's compiler and the clang compiler.

`__COUNTER__` evaluates to an integer literal whose value is increased by one every time it is found in a source code text.
