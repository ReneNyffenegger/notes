→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] allows to create a *preprocessed* file with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[`-E`] option:
code {
gcc -E foo.c > foo.i
code }


{ Misc

  The → https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s09.html[FHS] requires, for *historical reasons*, that `→ Linux/fhs/lib[/lib]/cpp` is a symbolic link
  to the preprocessor.
