$ Proxy: an example for Socket.cpp
@ proxy

This is an example for → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/Socket_cpp[Socket.cpp], a leight weight C++ class to demonstrate Sockets for Windows programming.

Usage
code {
proxy <port-proxy> <addr-server> <port-server>
code }

This proxy will then listen on `<port proxy>` and whenever it receives a
connection, will relay the traffic to the `<port server>` of `<addr server>`.
-
This makes it possible to see what an SMTP Client exchanges with a SMTP Server, or
equally what a NNTP client exchanges with an NNTP Server. (However, there are tools more suitable
for such a task)
