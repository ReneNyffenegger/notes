$ Socket.cpp - A C++ Socket class for Windows

Socket.cpp is a *leight weight* C++ class that facilitates and demonstrates Sockets for Windows programming.


{ Classes

  These are actually four classes: ~Socket~ (the base class), ~SocketServer~ and ~SocketClient~ (which two derive
  from which SocketServer) and ~SocketSelect~ which
  can be used to do a Select call on more than one Socket.
  
  The constructors of Socket are protected; this should be a taken as a hint not to use Socket, but
  either SocketServer or SocketClient.

}
{ Short description of the socket classes

  Every program that uses Windows Sockets needs to call `WSAStartup()`.
  -
  This call is wrapped into `Socket::Start()` which in turn is called by the Socket's constructor.
  -
  I pass 2.0 as version here as I expect that version to be installed.
  
  The Socket's constructor also calls `socket()` (note the small s) which actually
  creates the socket. It passes the `SOCK_STREAM` parameter, indicating TCP. If UDP
  were wished, you'd have to pass SOCK_DGRAM.
  
 `SocketClient` is inherited from Socket.
  - 
  The constructor of SocketClient takes a host as parameter, which is the name of
  the server that this client wishes to communicate to. This name is resolved
  into an IP Address by `gethostbyname()`.
  
 `SocketServer` is inherited from Socket.
  - 
  The constructor of the SocketServer class listens on the port indicated in its
  parameter. This is made by calling `bind()`.
  - 
  As SOCK_STREAM type sockets have the ability to queue incoming connection
  requests, we need to know the maximum number of connections to be queued which
  can be stated by the connections parameter (and which is passed to `listen()`).
  
 `SocketServer::Accept()` simply waits for an incoming connection request (or
  removes one from the queue) by calling `accept()` (note the small a).
