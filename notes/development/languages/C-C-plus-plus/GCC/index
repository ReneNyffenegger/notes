*GCC* stands for *GNU Compiler Collection*.

GCC requires → development/misc/GMP to be built.

{ Configure terms

  ~build~: The machine GCC is built on.

  ~host~: The machine that GCC will be run on

  ~target~: The machine that the built GCC (on the *host*) will produce executables for.

  *native*: build == host == target

  *cross*: build == host, host != target

  *canadian*: build != host, host != target, target != build

  *host-x-host* / *crossed native* / *cross-built native*: host == target, build != target

  The configure option `--target=abc-def` creates executables whose names are prependes with `abc-def`.

}
{ Directories #directories

  GCC treats → Linux/fhs/usr/local/include and → Linux/fhs/usr/local/lib specially: they're searched before the system directories.

}
{ Preprocessor


→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] allows to create a *preprocessed* file with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[`-E`] option:
code {
gcc -E foo.c > foo.i
code }

}

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/cc1[`cc1`], the compiler proper.
