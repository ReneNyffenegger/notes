*GCC* stands for *GNU Compiler Collection*.

GCC requires → development/misc/GMP to be built.

{ Configure terms

  ~build~: The machine GCC is built on.

  ~host~: The machine that GCC will be run on

  ~target~: The machine that the built GCC (on the *host*) will produce executables for.

  *native*: build == host == target

  *cross*: build == host, host != target

  *canadian*: build != host, host != target, target != build

  *host-x-host* / *crossed native* / *cross-built native*: host == target, build != target

  The configure option `--target=abc-def` creates executables whose names are prependes with `abc-def`.

}
{ Directories #directories

  GCC treats → Linux/fhs/usr/local/include and → Linux/fhs/usr/local/lib specially: they're searched before the system directories.

}
{ Preprocessor

→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] allows to create a *preprocessed* file with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[`-E`] option:
code {
gcc -E foo.c > foo.i
code }

}
{ TODO

  { Link Time Optimization (LTO)

   `lto-dump` is a tool for dumping LTO object files.

  }
  { Intermediate languages

    While GCC compiles a program, it represents the program with trhee intermediate languages: GENERIC, GIMPLE and RTL.

    { GENERIC
  
     *GENERIC* provides way of representing entire function in trees. This representation is possible for all languages supported by GCC.

    }
    { GIMPLE

      GIMPLE is for optimization which (as GENERIC) is independent from the language being compiled.
  
      GIMPLE is a three-address representation derived from GENERIC by breaking
      down GENERIC expressions into tuples of no more than 3 operands (with some
      exceptions like function calls). 

      GIMPLE has no control flow structures.

      Expressions with side effects are only allowed on the right hand side of assignments.
  
      The *gimplifier* converts GENERIC into GIMPLE.
  
      A C-like representation of the GIMPLE form can be dumped with `-fdump-tree-gimple`.
  
    }
    { RTL (Register Transfer Language)


      RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.

  { Plugins

    A plugin extends the functionality of GCC.
