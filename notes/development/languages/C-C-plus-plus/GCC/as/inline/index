$ GNU inline assembly

The gnu compile is instucted to insert inline assembly code with the `asm` or `__asm__` keyword.
-
The general form of `asm()` is:
code {
asm (
  "assembler code" :
   outputs         :
   inputs          :
   clobbers
);
code }

The compiler does not parse the passed assembler instructions.

{ Outputs and inputs

  The *outputs* and the *inputs* is a list of comma separated *operands*.

}
{ Operands

  An operand is described by an *operand-constraint string* followed by a c expression in paranthesis.

  *Output operands* are indicated by an `=` sign. Of course, these must be lvalues.

}
{ Operand constraint strings

  • `rm`: register or memory
  • `ri`: register or immediate
  • `g`: general (anything that the compiler chooses)
  • …

}
