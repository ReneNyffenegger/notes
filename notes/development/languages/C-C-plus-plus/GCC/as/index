$ GNU assembler

The executable name for the GNU assembler is `as`.

The main purpose of `as` is to assemble the output of the compiler (`gcc`) as object file which is then fed to the linker (`ld`).

When `as` invoked via `gcc`, the `-Wa` option forwards arguments to `as`. In the following example, `gcc` passes the two options `-alh` and `-L` to `as`:
code {
gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c
code }

{ Symbols and labels

  { Symbol

    A symbol is a case sensitive sequence of the characters `a` … `z`, `A` … `Z`, `0` … `9`, `.`, `_`, `$` which does not start with a digit.
    -
    Other characters can be included when embedding the symbol in double quotes (`"…"`). The `"` can be escaped with `\`.
    -
    See also the `--multibyte-handling` option.

    Symbols are given by the programmer to name things and then used by the linker and debugger.

    A symbol has a name, a type and a value.
    -
    The *type* specifies (among others) relocation information (see also the `.type` directive)

    { Local symbols

      Local symbols are not saved in object files.

      On ELF systems, a symbol that starts with `.L` is a *local symbol*.

    }

  }
  { Labels

    A label is a symbol that is immediatly followed by a colon (`:`).

    A label represents the current value of the *active location counter*.

    Labels can be used, for example, as instruction operands.

    See also the `.set` and `.eqv` directives.

    { Local lables

      Local labels are used to use names temporarily.

      The symbol of a local label is (non-negative) integer (for example `1234:`).

     `1234b` and `1234f` refer to the most recent previous and the next definition of the (local) label.

      There are also so-called «dollar-local labels» (`1234$:`)

    }

  }

}
{ Statements

  A *statement*
    • begins with zero or more labels,
    • is optionally followed by a *key symbol* and
    • ends with a new line character or a line separation character

  { Kind of statement

    The key symbol defines what kind the statement is and thus determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.
      • If the key symbol begins with a letter, the statement is an assembly language instruction.
      • If it begins with a dot, the statement is an *assembler directive*.

{ Some interesting directives

  Some interesting directives are:
  table { ll
    `.ascii "some text" …` ☰ Adds text without trailing zero byte
    `.asciz "some text" …` ☰ Adds text with trailing zero byte. When concatenating multiple strings (separated by commas), only the final string will be zero terminated.
    `.bss [n]` ☰ Assemble the following statements to the end of the *bss* section. ELF targets allow to add an optional subsection `n` which is a positive number. 
    `.code32`, `.code64` ☰ 
    `.data [n]` ☰ Assemble the following statements to the end of the *data* section. The optional `n` specifies the subsection and default to 0 if omitted.
    `.def NAM`, `.endef` ☰ Define deubging information for the symbol `NAM`. The definition extends until `.endef`
    `.end` ☰ End of source to be compiled
    `.func NAM[, LBL]`, `.endfunc` ☰ If source is assembled with enabled debugging, `.func` emits the function name as debugging information. `LBL` is entry point for the function and resolves to `NAM` prepended with the *leading char* (which typically is an underscore or nothing, depending on the architecture).
    `.globl SYM`☰ Makes *symbol* visible to `ld`. `.global` and `.globl` are equivalent.
    `.hidden`, `.internal`, `protected` ☰ ELF visiblity directives.
    `.if`, `.else` etc. ☰ Conditional compilation
    `.incbin "file"[, skip[, count]]` ☰ Include `file` verbatim at current location.
    `.include "file"` ☰ 
    `.byte`, `.word`, `.long`, `.quad`, `.octa` ☰ `.quad` is an 8-byte integer, `.octa` a 16-byte integer. `.short` is equivalent to `.word`, `.int` is equivalent to `.long`.
    `.loc fileno lineno [column] …` ☰ Emit DWARF2 line number information
    .`macro …` ☰ Startof a macro definition
    `.offset loc` ☰ Set the location counter to loc in the absolute section. `loc` must be an absolute expression. Do not confuse with `.org`
    `.org new-lc , fill` ☰
    `.reloc offset, reloc_name[, expression`] ☰
    `.section NAM` ☰ Specify the name of the section into which the following code is assembled.
    `.text [n]` ☰ Assemble the following statements to the end of the *text* section. The optional `n` specifies the subsection and default to 0 if omitted.
    `.weak NAMes` ☰
    `.zero n` ☰ Emit `n` bytes whose value is 0.

  { Useful preprocessor directives

    Useful preprocessor directives:
      • `.arch target-architecture` (to emit an error if an incompatible instruction for the target architecture is used). Compares to the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/m_lowercase/arch[`-march`] gcc option.
      • `.cpu cpu-name`: to specify the target processor (also to emit errors when incompatible instructions are used). Compares to the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/m_lowercase/cpu[`-mcpu`] gcc option.
      • `.include file`
      • `.macro`
      • `.if`
      • `.global` (to make a *symbol* visible to → Linux/shell/commands/ld[ld]).
      • `.equ` to define a constant. (Compares to the `#define` → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor] directive)
      • `.set`
      • `.name` to create an alias for register names
      • `.size`
      • `.struct`
      • `.skip`
      • `.space`
      • `.text`
      • `.string`
      • `.hword`, `.2byte`, `.word`, `.4byte`, `.quad`, `.8byte` for 16, 32 and 64 bit variable declarations.
      • `.ascii` / `.asciiz`
      • `.data`
      • `.bss` (unitialized data)
      • `.align …`

  }
  { dot symbol

    `.myaddr: .long`  defines `myaddr` to contain its own address.

    `.=.+4` is equivalent to `.space 4`

  }
  { -mtune

   `-mtune` specifies the processor to optimize for.
