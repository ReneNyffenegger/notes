$ GCC: cc1

`cc1` is also referred to as the *compiler proper*.

`cc1` preprocesses a C translation unit and compiles it into assembly code. The assembly code is converted into an → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file[object file] with
the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/as[assembler].

Earlier versions of cc1 used → Linux/fhs/usr/bin/cpp[`/usr/bin/cpp`] for the preprocessing stage.

The installation location of `cc1` can be determined with
code {
$ gcc → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/print/file-name[-print-file-name]=cc1
→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/_version_[/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10]/cc1
code }
