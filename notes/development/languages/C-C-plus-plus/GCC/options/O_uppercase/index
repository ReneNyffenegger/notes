$ gcc -O

Specify → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/optimization[optimization];
table { ll
  `-O0`  ☰ (Oh zero): Optimize for compilation time (which is the default optimization mode)
  `-O1` ☰ Try to reduce code size and execution time without increasing compilation time too much. (equal to `-O`)
  `-O2`  ☰ Optimize more
  `-O3`  ☰ Optimize *even* more
  `-Os`  ☰ Optimize for size. See also → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/f/omit-frame-pointer[`-fomit-frame-pointer`].
  `-oz`  ☰ Opimize more aggresively for size than with `-Os`. Introduced with GCC 12.1
  `-Ofast`  ☰ implies `-O3 -ffast-math -fno-protect-parens -fallow-store-data-races -fstack-arrays -fno-semantic-interposition`
  `-Og`  ☰ Optimize for debugging. `-Og` does not imply `→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/g`.
table }


Depending on the optimization level chosen, some compilatin flags (which can be controlled with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/f[`-f…` option] are automatically enabled.

sa:

  `-O` is not the same as the lowercase → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/o[-o] option.
