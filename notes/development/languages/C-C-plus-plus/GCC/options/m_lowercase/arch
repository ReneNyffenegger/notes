$ gcc -march

`-march` is an option that selects the used → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)].

`gcc -march=native` produces code that is optimized for the CPU that is used to compile the program.
-
Code proceduced with `-march=native` is not backwards compatible, for example, an executable procuded on an Intel Core CPU won't be able to run on an (old) Intel Atom CPU.)


Other possible values for the x86 family are:
  • x86-64
  • i386
  • i486
  • i586 or pentium
  • lakemont
  • pentium-mmx
  • pentiumpro
  • i686
  • pentium2
  • pentium3 or pentium-m
  • pentium4 or pentium4m
  • …

  { -march=x86-64-v3

   "
     For example, to select the second level, x86-64-v3, a programmer would build a
     shared object with the -march=x86-64-v3 GCC flag. The resulting shared object
     needs to be installed into the directory /usr/lib64/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v3
     or /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v3 (in case of dis-
     tributions with a multi-arch file system layout). In order to support systems that only
     implement the K8 baseline, a fallback implementation must be installed into the default
     locations, /usr/lib64 or /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. It has to be built with
     -march=x86-64 (the upstream GCC default). If this guideline is not followed, loading
     the library will fail on systems that do not support the level for which the optimized shared
     object was built.

    Apparently, there is also the possibility to set arch to windows: `-mwindows`.

sa:

 `-march=cpu-type` implies `-mtune=cpy-type` 

 `-mcpu` (which is deprecated for/on x86 or x86-64 systems)j
