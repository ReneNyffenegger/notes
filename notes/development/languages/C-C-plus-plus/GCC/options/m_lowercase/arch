$ gcc -march

`-march` is an option that selects the used → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)].

`gcc -march=native` produces code that is optimized for the CPU that is used to compile the program.
-
Code proceduced with `-march=native` is not backwards compatible, for example, an executable procuded on an Intel Core CPU won't be able to run on an (old) Intel Atom CPU.)


Other possible values for the x86 family are:
  • x86-64
  • i386
  • i486
  • i586 or pentium
  • lakemont
  • pentium-mmx
  • pentiumpro
  • i686
  • pentium2
  • pentium3 or pentium-m
  • pentium4 or pentium4m
  • …

    Apparently, there is also the possibility to set arch to windows: `-mwindows`.

sa:

 `-march=cpu-type` implies `-mtune=cpy-type` 

 `-mcpu` (which is deprecated for/on x86 or x86-64 systems)j
