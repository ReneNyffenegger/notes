  `optimizers` ☰ Display all of the optimization options supported by the compiler.
  `warnings` ☰ Display all of the options controlling warning messages produced by the compiler (see `→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/W`)
  `target` ☰ Display target-specific options. Unlike the `--target-help` option however, target-specific options of the linker and assembler are not displayed. This is because those tools do not currently support the extended `--help=` syntax.
  `params` ☰ Display the values recognized by the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/param[`--param`] option.
  `language` ☰ Display the options supported for language, where language is the name of one of the languages supported in this version of GCC. If an option is supported by all languages, one needs to select `common` class
  `common` ☰ Display the options that are common to all languages.
