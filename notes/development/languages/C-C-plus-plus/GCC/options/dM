$ gcc -dM

`-dM` prints macro definitions.

In order to use `-dM` , the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[`-E`] option must be specified, too. Otherwise, it's apparently interprted as `-fdump-rtl-mach`.

{ Printing predefined macros

  The `-dM` option can be used to print the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP/preprocessor/macros/predefined[predefined macros]:
gh|about-gcc|/options/d/M-predefined-macros||


}

{ Another example

  What was I thinking here?

  gh|about-gcc|/options/d/M.c||

}
sa:
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options
