$ gcc -H
@ -H

`gcc -H` prints the names of each header file that is processed.
-
Each `#include` indents one level, finishing a file dedents one level.

code {
$ echo '#include <syscall.h>' | gcc → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/c → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/x[-xc] - → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/P_uppercase[-P] -H

Multiple include guards may be useful for:
