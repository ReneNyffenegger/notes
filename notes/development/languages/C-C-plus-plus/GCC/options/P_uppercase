$ gcc -P

`gcc -P` prevents the preprocessor from including line markers in its output.

{ main.c

  Here's a simple c program that includes a header file (`foo.h`):
  gh|about-gcc|/options/P/main.c||

}
{ foo.h

  The included `foo.h` is even more simple:
  gh|about-gcc|/options/P/foo.h||

}
{ Makefile

  This → development/make/index[makefile] creates two precompiled versions of `main.c`, once using the `-P` option and once without it:
  gh|about-gcc|/options/P/Makefile||

}
{ main.i

  `main.i` is the file that was created without the `-P` option. Thus, it contains line markers in it: 
  gh|about-gcc|/options/P/main.i||

}
{ main_p.i

  `main_p.i` was created with the `-P` option. Thus, it contains no line markers:
  gh|about-gcc|/options/P/main_p.i||

}
