    `tm-max-aggregate-size` ☰  ☰ Size in bytes after which thread-local aggregates should be instrumented with the logging functions instead of save/restore pairs.
    `tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback` ☰ <0,100> ☰ The percentage of function, weighted by execution frequency, that must be covered by trace formation. Used when profile feedback is available.
    `tracer-dynamic-coverage` ☰ <0,100> ☰ The percentage of function, weighted by execution frequency, that must be covered by trace formation. Used when profile feedback is not available.
    `tracer-max-code-growth` ☰  ☰ Maximal code growth caused by tail duplication (in percent).
    `tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback` ☰ <0,100> ☰ Stop forward growth if the probability of best edge is less than this threshold (in percent). Used when profile feedback is available.
    `tracer-min-branch-probability` ☰ <0,100> ☰ Stop forward growth if the probability of best edge is less than this threshold (in percent). Used when profile feedback is not available.
    `tracer-min-branch-ratio` ☰ <0,100> ☰ Stop reverse growth if the reverse probability of best edge is less than this threshold (in percent).
    `tree-reassoc-width` ☰  ☰ Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel in reassociated tree.  If 0, use the target dependent heuristic.

    `uninlined-function-insns` ☰ <0,1000000> ☰ Instruction accounted for function prologue, epilogue and other overhead.
    `uninlined-function-time` ☰ <0,1000000> ☰ Time accounted for function prologue, epilogue and other overhead.
    `uninlined-thunk-insns` ☰ <0,1000000> ☰ Instruction accounted for function thunk overhead.
    `uninlined-thunk-time` ☰ <0,1000000> ☰ Time accounted for function thunk overhead.
    `unlikely-bb-count-fraction` ☰  ☰ The denominator n of fraction 1/n of the number of profiled runs of the entire program below which the execution count of a basic block must be in order for the basic block to be considered unlikely.
    `unroll-jam-max-unroll` ☰  ☰ Maximum unroll factor for the unroll-and-jam transformation.
    `unroll-jam-min-percent` ☰ <0,100> ☰ Minimum percentage of memrefs that must go away for unroll-and-jam to be considered profitable.
    `use-after-scope-direct-emission-threshold` ☰  ☰ Use direct poisoning/unpoisoning instructions for variables smaller or equal to this number.
    `use-canonical-types` ☰ <0,1> ☰ Whether to use canonical types.
    `vect-epilogues-nomask` ☰ <0,1> ☰ Enable loop epilogue vectorization using smaller vector size.
