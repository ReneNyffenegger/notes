$ gcc -C / -CC

With `-C` or `-CC`, the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor] is instructed to keep the comments.

This is demonstrated with the following little program:
gh|about-gcc|/options/C_/prog.c||

{ Compiling with -P -E

  When the source file is compiled with `→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/P_uppercase[-P] → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[-E]`, it produces
  gh|about-gcc|/options/C_/flag_none.i||

}
{ Also using -C

  With the `-C` option added, gcc produces:
  gh|about-gcc|/options/C_/flag_C.i||

}
{ Using -CC

  With the `-CC` option (instead the `-C` option), gcc produces:
  gh|about-gcc|/options/C_/flag_CC.i||

}
