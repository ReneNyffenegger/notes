$ gcc -E
@ -E

`gcc -E` only invokes the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor] without compiling or using the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/linker[linker].

Without → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/o, output is sent to standard out. 

By default, comments are removed. This can be overwritten with
→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/C_[`-C`] and `-CC`.

sa:

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/P_uppercase[`gcc -P`] to exclude the line markers in the output.

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/S_uppercase

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options

  The equivalent Visual Compiler options → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/E-P-EP[`/E`, `/P` and `/EP`].
