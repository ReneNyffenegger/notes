$ gcc -fpic / -fPIC 

With the `-fpic` or `-fPIC` flag, gcc creates an → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file with *position independent code*. This is usually necessary
when creating a shared object.

Apparently, on a *x86* environment, `-fpic` and `-fPIC` are equivalent. On other architectures, there *is* a difference.

{ Preprocessor macros

  When compiling with `-fpic`, the compiler defines the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] `__pic__` and `__PIC__` to `1`. When copmiling with `-fPIC`, these macros are defined to `2`.
