$ gcc -fpreprocessed

`gcc -fpreprocessed` indicates that the translation unit was already → Linux/fhs/usr/bin/cpp[preprocessed], thus most the preprocessor's task (like macro expansion) etc. will not be performed again.

Yet, the preprocessor still removes comments.

{ prog.c

  Here's a program that will be invoked with the `-fpreprocessed` flag.
  
  If the program were to be compiled with the canonical `gcc proc.c`, the preprocessor would replace `int`, `main` and `return` with meaningless tokens and render the program uncompilable.

  However, with `-fpreprocessed`, the lines starting with a `#` will just be ignored and an executable can be produced.
