$ gcc -fshort-wchar

The `-fshort-wchar` option specifies that the underlying type for a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/language/datatypes/wchar_t[`wchar_t`] should be `short unsigned int`.

The following program prints the size of a `wchar_t`:
gh|about-gcc|/options/f/short/wchar/prog.c||

This → development/make/index[Makefile] creates two versions of the program, one of which is compiled with the `-fshort-wchar` options.
gh|about-gcc|/options/f/short/wchar/Makefile||

On platforms, where the size of a `wchar_t` is four bytes, the version where the option is used, the size is reduced to two bytes.
