$ gcc -g
@ -g

`gcc -g` creates information suitable for debbuging a program with → development/tools/gdb[gdb].

Because a program should not be altered in any way when debugging information is added, the creators of gcc don't want have a specially defined
→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] when compiling with `-g`.

{ Some options

  Some `-g` related options are:
    • `-g`: Generate default debug info (DWARF)
    • `-g3`: Include info for → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macros].
    • `-ggdb`: Add specific → development/tools/gdb[GDB] information.
    • `-gdwarf[234]`: DWARF 2, 3 or 4 info
    • `-gstrict-dwarf`: No extensions from later DWARF.

}

sa:

  `→ development/GNU/toolchain/binutils/readelf[readelf] -w` dumps all DWARF data.
