$ Creating a shared and static library with the gnu compiler (gcc)

2018-01-27: *Moved and adapted from `adp-gmbh.ch`*.

Here's a summary on how to create a shared and a static library with gcc. The goal is to show the basic steps. I do not want to go into the hairy details. It should be possible to use this page as a reference.

These examples were tested and run on → Linux

Update *2018-12-08*: → https://github.com/albfan[Alberto Fanjul (albfan)] has contributed the necessary files to → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/create-libraries/Meson[demonstrate the building of the libraries with the Meson build system].

{ The tq84-library sources #tq84-lib-src

  The library we're going to build is called *tq84*. The sources for this library are located under `./src/tq84`.
  -
  The library consists of two c-files: `add.c` and `answer.c`.
  
  `add.c` exhibits two functions: `setSummand()` and `add()`.
  -
  `add()` returns the passed value and adds it to the value that was set with `setSummand()`.

  `answer.c` has only one function: `answer()` which uses `setSummand(20)` and `add(22)` to produce the number `42` which it returns as answer.

  Additionally, the library (`add.c`) has also the functions `initLibrary` and `exitLibrary` to demonstrate the influence of `__attribute__ ((constructor)` and `__attribute__ ((destructor))`.
  These functions are called when the library is loaded and unloaded.

  { add.c

    The code for the library:
    gh|gcc-create-library|/src/tq84/add.c||
  
  }
  { add.h
  
    The header file for the library:
    gh|gcc-create-library|/src/tq84/add.h||
  
  }
  { answer.c

    gh|gcc-create-library|/src/tq84/answer.c||
  
  }
  { answer.h
  
    The header file for answer.c
    gh|gcc-create-library|/src/tq84/answer.h||
  
  }
}
{ main.c #main-src

  `./src/main.c` is the source code that uses the tq84-library
  gh|gcc-create-library|/src/main.c||

}
{ Create the object files

  First, we create the object files.

  Object files for the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/libraries/shared[shared library] need to be compiled with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/f/pic[`-fPIC`] flag (PIC = position independent code).
  -
  The object files for the static library don't need this flag.

  So, the created object files go into different directories: `bin/shared` and `/bin/static`:w

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/create-object-files||

}
{ Create static library

  A static library is basically a set of → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file[object files] that were copied into a single file with the suffix `.a`.

  The static file is created with the → development/GNU/toolchain/binutils/ar[archiver] (`ar`). 

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/create-static-library||

}
{ Link statically

  With the static library, we can statically link `main.o` with the library.

  The `-L` flag indicates (a non standard) directory where the libraries can be found.

  The `-l` flag indicates the name of the library. Note, that it assumes the library to start with `lib` and end with `.o` (so `lib` and `.o` must not be specified)

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/link-statically||

  The created executable `bin/statically-linked` is not dependent on any other object file or library. It can be distributed without the `.a` file or the `.o` files. It
  can be executed on the → Linux/shell like so:
code {
$ ./bin/statically-linked
code }


}
{ Create the shared library

  Here, we create a shared library without SONAME.

  A shared library is created with GCC's → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/shared[`-shared`] flag and naming the resultant file with the suffix `.so` rather than `.a`.

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/create-shared-library||

}
{ Link dynamically with the shared library

  Note the similarity to linking with the static library. Since we specify the shared directory `bin/shared` with the `-L` flag, the linker links with `libtq84.so`.

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/link-dynamically||

}
{ Use the shared library with LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  As long as the shared library is not installed in a default location (such as → Linux/fhs/usr/lib), we must indicate where it is found. This is possible with the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  → development/environment-variable[environment variable].

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/use-shared-library-LD_LIBRARY_PATH||

}
{ Move the shared library to a default location

  Let's move the shared library to `/usr/lib` so that we can execute `bin/use-shared-library` without explicitely setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/move-shared-object||

}
{ Use the shared library in a default location

  Now, with the library in `/usr/lib`, the executable can be run without setting the variable:

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/use-shared-library-no-LD_LIBRARY_PATH||

}
{ Use dlopen() etc to dynamically load the library

  It's also possible to dynamically load a library from an executable. The necessary functions are `dlopen()`, `dlsym()` etc. whose definitions are found in `dlfcn.h`.

  The following program tries to open the library `libtq84.so` and then to find the functions `doesNotExist`, `setSummand` and `add`.

  gh|gcc-create-library|/src/dynamic-library-loader.c||

  In order to use the `dl…()` functions, it must be linked against `libdl` (with the `-ldl` flag)
  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/create-dynamic-library-loader||

}
{ Create a SONAME shared library

  A shared library with a SONAME can be created with the `-soname` linker option.

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/create-soname-library||

}
{ Link with the SONAME shared library

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/link-soname-library||

}
{ Install the SONAME library

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/install-soname-library||

}
{ Using LD_DEBUG

  The `LD_DEBUG` environment variable might be helpful for some debugging tasks related to shared libraries.

{ Difference between -fPIC and without -fPIC

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/show-difference-PIC||

}
{ readelf reloc

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/readelf-relocs||

}
{ List symbols in object files

  gh|gcc-create-library|/steps/list-symbols||

}
{ Cleaning up
