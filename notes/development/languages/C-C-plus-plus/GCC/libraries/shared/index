$ shared libraries

{ sonames and real names

  Every shared library has a *soname* and a *real name*

  A *soname* apparently is `lib${LIBNAME}${API_VERSION}.so.${MAJOR_VERSION}`. Usually, `${API_VERSION}` is empty. So, it becomes something like `libTQ84.so.2`.
  -
  `$MAJOR_VERSION` is incremented when the library's interface changes.

  The *real name* is `${SONAME}.${MINOR_VERSION}.${RELEASE_NUMBER}`. The name is the name of the file that contains the actual code of the library.
