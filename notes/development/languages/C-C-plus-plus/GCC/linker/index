$ GCC linker
@ linker

The linker reads → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file[object files] and combines them to create a runnable program (executable).

The linker can be invoked directly → Linux/shell/commands/ld[`ld`] or indirectly via `gcc`.
-
When invoked via `gcc`, options can be passed to the linker with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/Wl[`-Wl,option`].

`gcc` doesn't invoke the linker if it is run with the 
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/c[`-c`],
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/E[`-E`] or
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/S_uppercase[`-S`] option.
