$ C++ Standard Library: string_view


{ Simple demo

  In order to compile this demo, I had to specify the minimum standard (C++ 17): `g++ -std=c++17 demo.cpp`.


  gh|about-cpp-standard-library|/string_view/demo.cpp||

  This simple demo program prints, when compiled and run on my computer:
code {
Difference between addresses: 96
456
Difference between addresses: -4
456789
code }

  Thus, it demonstrates that `std::string_view::substr()` returns a view onto the string view on which `substr()` is called and the difference between their respective addresses is only 4.
  -
  Also, the `char*` returned by `.data()` is not null-terminated, thus, the rest of the original string is printed.

  Conversely, if `substr()` is called on a `std::string`, it creates a new string, therefore, the difference between their addresses is larger than 4.
