$ C++ Standard Library: std::setw

`std::setw` is a manipulator that sets the width of the next element that is printed to a stream object with the `<<` operator. It is very useful to create tabular (aligned) output of data.

In the next simple example, the texts (`txt`) are printed with a width of 19 characters while the numbers (`num`) are printed with a width of 4 characters.

Because numbers are typically right aligned, the manipulator `std::right` is also used.

Output:
code {
forty-two            42
ninty-nine           99
one hundred and one 101
seven                 7
fourteen             14
fünf                 5
code }

Note the problem with the umlaut `ü`.
