  { Enable debugging

    In order to enable debugging, the `TQ84_DEBUG_ENABLED` → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] needs to be set:
code {
#define TQ84_DEBUG_ENABLED
code }

  }
  { Width of function name and of source file name

    The output width of the function name and of the source file name can be controlled with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macros]
   `TQ84_DEBUG_FUNCNAME_WIDTH` and `TQ84_DEBUG_FILENAME_WIDTH`.

    Note: these macros need to be defined as strings because they are concatenated to a larger string by the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor].

code {
#define TQ84_DEBUG_FILENAME_WIDTH "20"
#define TQ84_DEBUG_FUNCNAME_WIDTH "50"
code }

  }
  { Destination

    In order to set the debug output destination, exactly one of the following two macros needs to be defined:
   `TQ84_DEBUG_TO_FILE`, `TQ84_DEBUG_TO_MEMORY`.

  }
