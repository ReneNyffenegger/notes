$ tq84-debug

Write hierarchical log messages to quickly debug a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[c] or → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP[c++] application.

*tq84-debug* works with GCC and relies on the `__attribute__(cleanup …)` mechanism to automatically dedent indented log messages.

{ Functions (macros)

  The following preprocessor macros wrap the underlying functions. The functions are enabled by definining `TQ84_DEBUG_ENABLED`.

  table { ll
    `TQ84_DEBUG_OPEN` ☰ Open file (if `TQ84_DEBUG_TO_FILE` is defined) or memory destintation (otherwise) for output.
    `TQ84_DEBUG_INDENT_T` ☰ Indent a level with  → development/languages/printf[`printf`] modifiers
    `TQ84_DEBUG_INDENT` ☰ Indent a level and automatically insert function name to log.
    `TQ84_DEBUG` ☰ Write a debug message. Use → development/languages/printf[`printf`] modifiers such as `%s`, `%d` etc.
    `TQ84_DEBUG_DEDENT` ☰ Dedent an indentation.
    `TQ84_DEBUG_RETURN(expr)` ☰ Log value of `expr` and return it to caller

  table }

  { Enable debugging

    In order to enable debugging, the `TQ84_DEBUG_ENABLED` → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] needs to be set:
code {
#define TQ84_DEBUG_ENABLED
code }

  }
  { Width of function name and of source file name

    The output width of the function name and of the source file name can be controlled with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macros]
   `TQ84_DEBUG_FUNCNAME_WIDTH` and `TQ84_DEBUG_FILENAME_WIDTH`.

    Note: these macros need to be defined as strings because they are concatenated to a larger string by the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessor].

code {
#define TQ84_DEBUG_FILENAME_WIDTH "20"
#define TQ84_DEBUG_FUNCNAME_WIDTH "50"
code }

  }
  { Destination

    In order to set the debug output destination, exactly one of the following two macros needs to be defined:
   `TQ84_DEBUG_TO_FILE`, `TQ84_DEBUG_TO_MEMORY`.
