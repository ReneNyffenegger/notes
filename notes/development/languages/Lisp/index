In Lisp, everything is either
  • an atom, or
  • a list

A list contains atoms or other lists. These elements are put within parenthesis and separated with commas.

Atoms are literals like 42, "Hello World" or names of variables or functions.

Unless instructed otherwise, a list triggers a function call, the first argument being the name of the function.
