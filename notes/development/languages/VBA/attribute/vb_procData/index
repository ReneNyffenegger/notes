$ VBA: attribute name.vb_procData.vb_invoke_func

The → development/languages/VBA/attribute[VBA function attribute] `vb_ProcData.vb_invoke_func` is «generated» after recording a macro (at least in → Microsoft/Office/Excel).

After recording a macro, giving it the name `rec` *and* assigning the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+T`, adding a description, the corresponding `Attribute` lines looks like so:
code {
Sub rec()
Attribute rec.VB_Description = "This macro was recorded to\nreveal Attribute values."
Attribute rec.VB_ProcData.VB_Invoke_Func = "t\n14"

   …

End Sub
code }

Note that shortcut keys that were assigned with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/onKey[`application.onKey`] (Excel) are not stored with such attributes
