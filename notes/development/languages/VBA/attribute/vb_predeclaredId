$ VBA: attribute vb_predeclaredId

This is an example that tries to demonstrate the effect of the `vb_predeclaredId` → development/languages/VBA/attribute[attribute].

A (→ development/languages/VBA/language/classes[class]) module that sets the value of `vb_predeclaredId` to → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[`true`] creates a global («predeclared») instance of that class
without having to initialize this global instance with the → development/languages/VBA/language/operators/new[`new` operator].

Besides this global instance, it is possible to create additional instances of this class.

{ predeclared.cls

  This is the source code of the class whose attribute `vb_predeclaredId` is set to `true`:
  gh|about-VBA|/attribute/vb_predeclaredId/predeclared.cls||

}

{ func.vb

  This → development/languages/VBA/language/module[module] accesses the global instance and creates an additional one, named `abc`:
  gh|about-VBA|/attribute/vb_predeclaredId/func.vb||

}

{ Creating the project

  The following → development/languages/VBScript file uses the → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator to create an Excel project in order to run `main` (in `func.vb`):

  gh|about-VBA|/attribute/vb_predeclaredId/create.wsf||

  On the command line, it must be invoked with
code {
P:\ath\to\project> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cscript_exe[cscript] .\create.wsf
code }

}
