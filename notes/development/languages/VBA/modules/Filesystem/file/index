$ VBA: file class

The following is a class that basically encapsulates the call of → development/languages/VBA/functions#freeFile[`freeFile()`] to determine the next available file number to be used with → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/open[`open`] and `close`.

{ Methods

  table { ll
    `open_(path)` ☰
    `print_(txt)` ☰ Writes text into the opened file.
    `printWithNL(txt)` ☰ Writes text into opened file and ends it with a → development/line-break[new line].
    `close_()` ☰
  table }

}
{ Source code

  gh|VBAModules|/Filesystem/file.cls||

}
{ Test

  gh|VBAModules|/_test/Filesystem/file.vb||

}
{ TODO

  Should `print_()` and `printWithNL()` be renamed to `write_` and `writeWithNL`.

  Should the `file` class be used by the → development/languages/VBA/modules/dbg/dbgFileWriter[`dbgFileWriter`] class?
