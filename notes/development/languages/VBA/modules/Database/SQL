$ VBA Module SQL [Database]

The following SQL VBA modules currently has two functions:
  • `removeSQLComments` to remove simple `--` comments from a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string] (`/* … */` is not yet implemented)
  • `sqlStatementsOfFile` returns the statements that are found in a file. The statements need to be separated by a semicolon (`;`).

`sqlStatementsOfFile` relies on `slurpFileCharSet` which can be found → https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/languages/VBA/modules/Common/File[here].
-
The function, in turn, is needed by → development/languages/VBA/modules/Access/CommonFunctionalityApp[the sub `RunSQLScripts()`] which runs the statements found in a file in
an → development/databases/Access[Access] database.
