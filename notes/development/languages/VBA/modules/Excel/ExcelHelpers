$ VBA Module ExcelHelpers [Excel]

*ExcelHelpers* is a → development/languages/VBA/language/module[Visual Basic for Application module] that provides some functions I encounter when automating Excel related tasks
with → development/languages/VBA[VBA].

{ findWorksheet

  `findWorksheet(…)` returns the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] that is identified by the given name.

  If no such worksheet exists, it is created.

  Optionally, the paramter `deleteIfExists` can be set to → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[`true`] to always return a newly created worksheet.

}
{ deleteWorksheet

 `deleteWorksheet` acts according to its name.

  It turns out that deleting a worksheet is not a really straight forward operation in VBA.

}
{ freezeHeader

 `freezeHeader` (horizontally) freezes a header, by default one row.

  If the → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/optional-parameters[optional parameter] `bottomRow` is assigned a value, it indicates the number of rows to be frozen.

}
{ colLetterToNum

 `colLetterToNum` returns the column (as number) that corresponds to a column letter. (`colLetterToNum("D")` returns 4 etc.)

}
