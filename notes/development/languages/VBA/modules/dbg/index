$ VBA classes for hierarchical debugging

{ dbg.cls

 `dbg` is a class that can be used for *hierachical debugging*.

  Calling `indent` increases the indent-level, `dedent` deccreases it.

  The method `text` actually writes the passed → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string to the destination. The string is prepended with the 2 times the amount of indent levels of spaces.

  When the class is initialiezed with the method `init`, a derived class of `dbgWriter` needs to be given. Currently, there are to derived classes: `dbgFileWriter` which writes the debug-text to a
  file and `dbgWordWriter` which writes the debug-text into a → Microsoft/Office/Word[Word] document
