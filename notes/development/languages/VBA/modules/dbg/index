$ VBA classes for hierarchical debugging

{ dbg.cls

 `dbg` is a class that can be used for *hierachical debugging*.

  Calling `indent` increases the indent-level, `dedent` decreases it.

  The method `text` actually writes the passed → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string to the destination. The string is prepended with twice the amount of current indent levels of spaces.

  When the class is initialiezed with the method `init`, a derived class of `dbgWriter` needs to be given. Currently, there are to derived classes: `dbgFileWriter` which writes the debug-text to a
  file and `dbgWordWriter` which writes the debug-text into a → Microsoft/Office/Word[Word] document

  table { ll

    `init` ☰ 
    `indent` / `dedent` ☰ indent or dedent the level by one. `indent` can optionally be passed a string.
    `text` ☰ write the text with current indent level
    `text_` ☰ private method that calls the instance referred to by `dbgWriter` to write some text to the respective output destination
    `undhandledError` ☰ write `→ development/languages/VBA/objects/err[err].description`, call `dedent` and pass error to calling function
    `removeSpecialCharacters` ☰ private function to remove new lines and curly braces from the string passed to `text`
