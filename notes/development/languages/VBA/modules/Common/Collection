$ VBA Module Collection [Common]

The intention of this → development/languages/VBA/language/module is to help dealing with «collection»

It turned out that the name of this module was not chosen wisely because VBA already has a `→ development/languages/VBA/collection` type. Therefore, when using this module it must be given a name not equal to `collection`.
