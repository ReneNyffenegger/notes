$ VBA Module File [Common]

{ File.bas

  `slurpFile` reads the entire content of a file and returns it as a development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string].

  `flushToFile` is the opposite of `slurpFile`: it writes a string to a file.

  `fileBaseName` turns a path (such as `p:\ath\to\foo.txt`) to the name of a file without suffix (in this case: `foo`).

  `fileSuffix` returns the suffix of the file only (for example: `txt`).

  `fileExists` checks if a given file exists.

  `tempPath` uses the → Windows/development/WinAPI function `GetTempPath` to return the folder into which temporary files can (should?) be written.
