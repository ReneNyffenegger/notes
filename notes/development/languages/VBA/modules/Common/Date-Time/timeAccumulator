$ VBA class: timeAccumulator

`timeAccumulator` is a → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[VBA class] that allows to measure elapsed time to accumulated multiple measurements.

The class provides three methods: `startAccumulating`, `stopAccumulating` and `elapsed_ms`elapsed_ms`.

`stopAccumulating` returns the time that was spent since the last call of `startAccumulating` in *ticks* and adds this amount to the
member variable `accumulatedTime`.

`elapsed_ms` reports the accumulated time that was spent between alternating calls of `stopAccumulating` and `stopAccumulating` in milli-seconds.
