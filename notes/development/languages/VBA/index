$ Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
@ VBA

VBA is the abbreviation for *Visual Basic for Applications*.

VBA's focus is on programming the → Microsoft/Office[Office] suite. It allows to automate almost all interaction between a user and an office document that otherwise would have to be carried
out with mouse or keyboard.

→ development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/conditional-compilation[Conditional compilation]

The *line continuation character* of VBA is → development/languages/VBA/line-continuation[the underscore (`_`)].

{ VBA Environment

  A VBA program runs in a *VBA Environment* which is hosted and controlled by another program, typically
  → Microsoft/Office[MS Office programs] (→ Microsoft/Office/Word[Word], → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] …).

  An environment consists of one ore more *VBA Projects*.

? The amount of trust that is granted to an → Microsoft/Office VBA environment is controlled in the respective → Microsoft/Office/security/Trust-Center.

}
{ VBA Project #vba-project

  A VBA Project is a container for VBA code. Thus, all VBA programs run in the context of a VBA Project.

  A project has a *project name* and consists of a set of named → development/languages/VBA/language/module[modules] and of an ordered list of *project references*.

  A *project reference* refers to a another project. It allows a project to access public entities in that other project.

  Three types of projects:
    • source (written in the → development/languages/VBA/language[VBA language])
    • library (not necessarily written with the VBA language)
    • host: a library project that is inserted into the VBA Environment by the *host application*

  The special project *VBA* is available in every VBA Environment. The VBA project contains a set of → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[classes],
  → development/languages/VBA/functions[functions], enums and constants: the so called *VBA standard library*.

  The components within a VBA project can be accessed via the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model[VBE] object → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBProject[`VBProject`].

{ VBA standard library

  The *VBA standard library* is probably also referred to as → development/languages/VBA/runtime-lib[runtime library].

}
{ Versions #vba-version

  VBA 7.0 is shipped with → Microsoft/Office[MS Office] 2010; VBA 7.1 is shipped with MS Office 2013.
  -
  This version is also reflected in the → Windows/registry[registry] key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/VBA/7_0[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\7.x`].
