$ VBA classes: reference counting

As per → http://www.xbeat.net/vbspeed/i_VBVM6Lib.html[Michael Rutten's Hidden Gems for Free], a *regular → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[Visual Basic object]* stores
is reference count at the memory location right after its *VTable pointer*.
-
This is demonstrated with the following → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[class]. Its member function `objRefCnt` gets the ref count from the second DWORD in the object (whose address
of the first DWORD is found with `objPtr`).

Apparently, passing an object to a function increases its reference count by two which is why 2 is subtracted before returning the reference count.

{ Foo.cls

 `Foo` is a simple → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[class] which we will use below in the test.

{ test.bas

  A simple test.
