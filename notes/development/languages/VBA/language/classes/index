$ VBA: classes

Classes require a *class module* whose name determines the name of the class it contains.

{ Constructor, destructor

  Defining a class with a constructor and a destructor.

  Note again: classes (such as the above) need to be inserted into a VBA project as *class module*, not as a »standard« module.

  Initializing the class (calls the constructor and the destructor):
  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/constructor-destructor/main.bas||

}
{ Member variables

  Defining a class with three member variables of which two are `public` and one
  is `private`.
  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/member-variables/tq84.bas||

  Using the class
  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/member-variables/main.bas||

}
{ Member functions

  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/member-variables/tq84.bas||

  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/member-variables/main.bas||

}
{ property let/set

  After defining `property let` and `property set` functiones, the person's name and age can be set with the familiar VBA constructs `obj.member = var` and
  `var = obj.member`.

  Here, we're definining a class for a person with such property set and let functions. As usual with simple examples, a person has a name and an age.

  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/let-set/person.bas||

  The corresponding sub that uses the class:
  gh|about-VBA|/language/classes/let-set/main.bas||

  TODO: Compare with `property set` method.
