$ VBA: global variables

At → development/languages/VBA/language/module[module]-level, a → development/languages/VBA/language/variables[variable] can be declared using the `global` statement. Such a variable is accessible from other modules as well:
code {
option explicit

global g_foo as long

sub doSomething
    …
end sub

…
code }

The value of a global variable is not destroyed when a program ends normally. However, the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/end[`end`] statement destroys global variables,
see → development/languages/VBA/language/variables/global/lifetime[here].
