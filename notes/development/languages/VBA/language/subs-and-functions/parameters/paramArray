  The `paramArray` keyword allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/parameters[sub or function].

  The following example calculates the sum of the passed parameters:

{ Passing on a paramArray

  The following example tries to call a function that takes a `paramArray` which in turn calls another function which takes a `paramArray`.

  It turns out that the array that the first function receives is passed on to the second function as the first element in a single element array.

  Because the second function (`sum` in our case) is also called directly, it first needs to check whether the first element in the received array is an array or not.
