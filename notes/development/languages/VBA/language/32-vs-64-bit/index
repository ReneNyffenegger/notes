$ VBA: 32-bit vs 64-bit

The → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/longPtr[`longPtr` data type] is 4 bytes in a 32-bit environment (of → Microsoft/Office) and 8 bytes in a 64-bit environment.

The → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/longLong[`longLong` data type] is only defined in 64-bit environments, see
→ development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/winX/longLong[testing for 64-bit environments].

In a 64-bit environment, the compiler directive constant `win64` → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/const#vba-predefined-compiler-constants[is predefined],
see → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/winX[also here].

  The `ptrSafe` keyword makes sure that a → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/declare[`declare` statement] can be safely run in a 64 bit-environment.
