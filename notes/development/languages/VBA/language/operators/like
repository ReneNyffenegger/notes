{ Escaping special characters

  The four special characters `?`, `#`, `*` and `[` can be escaped by enclosing them into a pair of square brackets, for example `[#]`.

  It doesn't seem possible to escape the closing square bracket `]` in a group - but it matches itself when used outside of a group.
