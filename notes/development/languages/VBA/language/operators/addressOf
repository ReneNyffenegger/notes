$ VBA operator: addressOf

The `addressOf` → development/languages/VBA/language/operators[operator] evaluates to a long (at least on 32 Bit Windows versions) which usually are used for
used for → development/languages/VBA/Win-API[Win API] callbacks (such as needed for
→ development/languages/VBA/Win-API/examples/EnumWindows[`EnumWindows`] or → development/languages/VBA/Win-API/examples/EnumChildWindows[`EnumChildWindows`]).

{ Directly using value of the result of addressOf

  Because `addressOf` is an operator, it cannot be directly used to use the value it evalutes to directly, the following would not work:
code {
dim addr as longPtr
addr = addressOf(…)
code }

However, with `vba.int(…)`, it becomes possible:
code {
dim addr as longPtr
addr = vba.int(addressOf(…))
code }


}
