$ VBA: Passing an array to a function

The following simple example tries to demonstrate how an array can be passed to a VBA → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[function].

The code snippet declares two functions:
  • `dot_product_explicit_datatype (byRef vec_1() as double, byRef vec_2() as double) as double`
  • `dot_product_variant (byRef vec_1 as variant, byRef vec_2 as variant)`

The first function has the advantage that the array-parameters are strongly typed (array of → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double[doubles]). However, on its downside,
when this function is called, it needs a → development/languages/VBA/language/variables that matches this declared type. 

The scond function has the advantage that it can be called with an «in-place declaration» of an array:
code {
xyz = dot_product_variant( array(…), array(…) )
code }
