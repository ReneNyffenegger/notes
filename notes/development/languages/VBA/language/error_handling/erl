$ VBA: reporting the line on which an error occured with erl()

If a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub or function] is created with line numbers, then the `erl()` function can be used to determine on which line
the error occured.

The following example runs into a *division by zero* on line 11 which is trapped because of the → development/languages/VBA/language/error_handling/on_error_goto[`on error goto err_`. There,
`erl` reports line 11 as the causing line.
