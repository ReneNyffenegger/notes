{ Error handler Terminology

  An *error handler* is neither a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub nor a function], rather, its a section of a sub or function that starts
  with a *label*.

  Such an *error handler* is said to be ~enabled~ if was turned on with a → development/languages/VBA/language/error_handling/on_error_goto[`on error goto <label>`] statement.

  When an enabled error handler *is handling* an error, the error handler is said to be ~active~.
