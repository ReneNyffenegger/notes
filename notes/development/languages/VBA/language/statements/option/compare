$ VBA: option compare

The `option compare` statement controls how → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[strings] are compared:

In order to compare strings case insensitively, the statement needs the `text` «argument»:
code {
option compare text
code }

In order to compare strings case sensitively, the statement needs the `boolean` «argument». (This is the default).
code {
option compare boolean
code }

In addition, → development/languages/VBA code that is written for → development/databases/Access also allows to declare `database` which uses the database's setting:
code {
option compare database
code }


sa:

  The VBA function → development/languages/VBA/functions/strComp[`strComp()`] allows to compare strings case sensitvely *or* case insensitively.

  → development/languages/VBA/language/statements
