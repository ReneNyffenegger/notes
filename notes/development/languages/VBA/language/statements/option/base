$ VBA statement: option base 

`option base` specifies the default number for the first element in an → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays[array].

{ Simple demonstration

  The following three → development/languages/VBA/language/module[VBA modules] try to demonstrate the effect of `option base` on the creation of arrays:

  { without.bas

    Without an explicit `option base` statement, arrays are created with their first index being 0.

    gh|about-VBA|/language/statements/option/base/without.bas||

  }
  { with.bas

    The following module specifies `option base 1`. So, arrays, by default, are created with their first index being 1.

    gh|about-VBA|/language/statements/option/base/with.bas||

  }
  { run.bas

    The driver program calls the two functions and then checks the range of their indexes with the
    → development/languages/VBA/functions/lBound-uBound[`lBound` and `uBound`] functions.

}
