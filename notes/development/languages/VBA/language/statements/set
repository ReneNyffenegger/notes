$ VBA statement: set
@ set

{ Difference between set obj = and obj =

   Because in VBA objects can have devfault attributes, there is a difference between the following two lines:
code {
set obj = obj
obj = val
code }

  The first line changes the object reference, thus `obj` will reference anoother object.

  The second line doesn't change the object, it modifies its state (if it has a default attribute).

}
