$ VBA statement: appActivate
@ appActivate

`appActivate` activates the window with a given title (caption) or
→ Windows/development/process/identifer[task/process id] (as for example returned by the → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-shell[`shell`] function).

{ Excel

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel exposes the title of itself in the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model[object model] through → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-caption[`application.caption`]. This makes it
  possible to bring the currently running Excel application to the front with → development/languages/VBA like so:
code {
appActivate application.caption
code }

}

sa:

  → development/languages/VBA/language/statements
