$ VBA statement: select
@ select

The `select` statement allows to abbreviate repeated testing of the same variable with different values using the `if x = "foo" … elseif x = "bar" … elseif x = "baz"` more elegantly.

The statement roughly mimics the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C] `switch` statement.

The optional `case else` branch is executed if all other tests were false.
