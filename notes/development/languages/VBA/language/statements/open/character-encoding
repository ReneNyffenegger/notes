$ VBA open statement: character encoding

Apparently, when a file is opened with the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/open[`open` statement], it's not possible to specify
a character encoding.

The following simple test VBA program tries to read from a *Latin 1*, → development/Unicode/UTF-8[UTF-8] and UTF-16 encoded file.

The files are on github under 
→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-VBA/blob/master/language/statements/open/character-encoding/latin-1.txt[`latin-1.txt`],
→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-VBA/blob/master/language/statements/open/character-encoding/utf-8.txt[`utf-8.txt`] and
→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-VBA/blob/master/language/statements/open/character-encoding/utf-16.txt[`utf-16.txt`].

When I executed the script, it printed the text from the `latin-1.txt` and `utf-16.txt` files correctly while it displayed the text of `utf-8` as
code {
Line read from utf-8.txt is: RenÃ© says: hello
code }

{ Alternative: Using ADODB to read UTF-8 encoded files

  If a UTF-8 file needs to be read in VBA, it seems possible using the → development/databases/ADO[ADODB] object
  → development/databases/ADO/objects/stream/loadFromFile#adodb-stream-loadFrom-file-charCode[stream along with loadFromFile].
