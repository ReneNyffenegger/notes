$ VBA: looping statements

Looping → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statements] are
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/for[`for n = x to y … next n`]
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/for#vba-for-each[`for each itm in lst … next itm`]
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/do-while[`do while … loop`]
  • `do until`
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/while[`while wend`]

{ Assignment and condition evaluation in one go

  It seems impossible to have an assignment *and* and an evaluation of the condition in one go (as in other languages such as → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C or C++]).
