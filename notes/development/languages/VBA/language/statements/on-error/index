$ VBA statement: on error

The → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] statement `on error` allows for some basic *poor man's error handling* in a VBA program.

code {
on error resume next    ' Ignore errors and continue executing statement as though nothing had happened.
on error goto   0       ' Disable policy handling (? that is use error handling of calling procedure ?)
on error goto   LABEL   ' Jump to label LABEL when error occurs
code }

`on error…`
  • specifies the new → development/languages/VBA/language/error_handling#vba-error-handling-policy[error handling policy] for the → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub or function] it occurs in and
  • resets the → development/languages/VBA/objects/err[`err` object] (by calling → development/languages/VBA/objects/err#clearing-err-object[err.clear()`]).


With → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error/resume-next[`on error resume next`], statements that cause an error are just skipped. The `resume next` indicates to execute the next statement.
