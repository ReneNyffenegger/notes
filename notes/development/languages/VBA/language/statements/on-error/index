$ VBA statement: on error

The `on error` statement specifies the new → development/languages/VBA/language/error_handling#vba-error-handling-policy[error handling policy] for the
→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/index[sub or function] it occurs in and resets
the → development/languages/VBA/objects/err[`err` object] (by calling → development/languages/VBA/objects/err#clearing-err-object[err.clear()`]).

The → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] statement `on error` allows for some basic *poor man's error handling*.

With → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error/resume-next[`on error resume next`], statements that cause an error are just skipped. The `resume next` indicates to execute the next statement.
