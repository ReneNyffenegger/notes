$ VBA statement: on error

The → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] statement `on error` allows for some basic *poor man's error handling*.

With → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error/resume-next[`on error resume next`], statements that cause an error are just skipped. The `resume next` indicates to execute the next statement.
