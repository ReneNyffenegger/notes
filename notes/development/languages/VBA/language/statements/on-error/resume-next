$ VBA statement: on error resume next

After setting `on error resume next`, erroneous statements don't cause the program to aborted, rather, the VBA interpreter will execute (resume) the next statement.

When an error occurs, the error number is recorded in `→ development/languages/VBA/objects/err[err].number`, a textual description of the error in `→ development/languages/VBA/objects/err[err].description.
Methods to clear the → development/languages/VBA/objects/err[`err`] object are → development/languages/VBA/objects/err[described here].
