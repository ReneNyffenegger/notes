$ VBA statement: deftype
@ deftype

The `defType` statements (such as `defInt`, `defLng`, `defStr`, …) allow to specifiy a character or a range of characters that determine the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[data type] for
→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/parameters[parameters] and return values of → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[functions].

Local variables still need to be declared with a → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/dim[`dim`] statement, although the data type is not necessary in that case.
