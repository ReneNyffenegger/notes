$ VBA: colon, the statement separator

In VBA, a statement is typically terminated at the end of a line (but see → development/languages/VBA/line-continuation[line continuation in VBA]).
-
In order to have multiple statements on one line, they can be separated by a colon:
code {
debug.print "foo" : debug.print "bar" : debug.print "baz"
code }

The problem with the colon is that it is also used to define *labels*. Thus, the following probably does not do what the auther indended, because `doSomething :` will be interpreted as a label by the
→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor[VB Editor's] eagerness to lay out code.
code {
sub doSomething
    …
end sub

sub main
    doSomething : doAnotherThing
end sub
code }
