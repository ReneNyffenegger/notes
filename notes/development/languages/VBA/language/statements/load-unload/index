$ VBA statements: load, unload

`load obj` loads a 
-
`unload obj` removes an object from memory

Typically, such objects are → development/languages/VBA/objects/userForms[UserForms]. After loading a UserForm, it is not visible and needs to be made visible explicitely by
calling the UserForm's `.show()` method.

A typical scenario to use `load` on a UserForm is to set (global) member-variables of the form before showing the form:
code {
load frmXYZ

frmXYZ.val_1 = "foo"
frmXYZ.val_2 = "bar"
frmXYZ.val_3 = "baz"

frmxYZ.show()
code }

sa:

  Error 361: *Can't load or unload this object*.
