$ VBA statement: write#
@ write#

`write#` is designed to generate machine-readable output that are later consumed with → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/input[`input#`].
-
Therefore, strings being written with `write#` are enclosed in apostrophes. In order for VBA not to write the apostrophes,
→ development/languages/VBA/language/statements/print[`print#`] should be used.

`write#` also automatically adds a → development/line-break[line break].

The written file then looks as follows:
code {
"Line one"
"Line two"
"Line three"
code }
