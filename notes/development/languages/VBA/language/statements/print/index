$ VBA statement: print #
@ print #

Apparently, the `#` belongs to the statement.


{ Creating and writing to a file

  `print#` writes a line to a file. Unlike → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/write[`write#`], it does not enclose
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[strings] in apostrophes.

  By default, `print#` adds a  → development/line-break[line break] after the text that was written.

  The following example creates a file (→ development/languages/VBA/language/statements/open[`open`]) and writes three lines into it with `write#`. After finishing writing to the file,
  the file is closed with `close`.

}
{ Omitting new line at line's end

  In order to omit the line break, the print statement needs to be ended with a semicolon:

}
