$ VBA statement: print #
@ print #

Apparently, the `#` belongs to the statement.

`print#` writes a line to a file. Unlike → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/write[`write#`], it does not enclose
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[strings] in apostrophes. However, it also does add a  development/line-break[line break].
