$ VBA: data type date
@ date

A → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date/literals[date literal] allows to «hard code» a specific date/time unambigously, that is independent from the
currently used → development/locale.

A (variable) date (without time) can be constructed from three integer-variables with → development/languages/VBA/functions/time-date/dateSerial-timeSerial[`dateSerial(year, month, day)`].
-
Similarly, `timeSerial(hr, min, sec)` constructs a time.

The → development/languages/VBA/functions[functions] → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-now[`now`] returns the current date and time,
→ development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-date[`date`] just returns the current date.

→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date/format[`format`] can be used to convert a date into a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string].

Using → development/languages/VBA/functions/time-date/year-month-day-hour-minute-second[`year()`, `month()`, `day()`, `hour()`, `minute()` and `second()`] to extract the
respective parts of a date as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/integer[integer].

*Date arithmetic* is possible with  → development/languages/VBA/functions/dateAdd[`dateAdd(…)`] and → development/languages/VBA/functions/dateDiff[`dateDiff(…)`].
-
These functions add a given number of days to a date or return the number of days between two given days, respectively

→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date/internal[Internally], a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] is stored as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double[double].
the decimal places store the time fraction of a day and the non-decimal places the days since a given date.

The *default value* for a date is *1899-12-30 00:00:00*.

→ development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion/cDate[`cDate`] is a → development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion[conversion function] that converts the input parameter
to da date.

{ Internal representation #vba-date-internal

  → development/languages/VBA stores a date as a (8 byte) → development/IEEE/754[IEEE-754] floating point value (as is also a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double[`double`]).

  The value `0.0` corresponds to midnight (start of) December 30th, 1899:
code {
? format(→ development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion/cDate[cDate](0.0), "yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss")
1899-12-30 00:00:00
? format(→ development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion/cDate[cDate](0.0 + 1.0/86400), "yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss")
1899-12-30 00:00:01
? format(→ development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion/cDate[cDate](1.0), "yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss")
1899-12-31 00:00:00
code }

}
