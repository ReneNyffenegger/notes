$ VBA: Convert a UTC text to a date

A combination of → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-dateSerial[`dateSerial()`],
→ development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-timeSerial[`timeSerial()`] and
→ development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-mid[`mid()`] allows to create a
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] from a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string].

The following example tries to demonstrate how a string that is formatted according to → misc/UTC[UTC] (without timezone) might be converted to a date.

The following → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[function] `UTCStringToDate()` tries to demonstrate how these two functions might be combined
with → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-mid[`mid()`] to create a date from a UTC string.
