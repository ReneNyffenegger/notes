$ VBA - language: date literals
@ date literals

A date literal is enclosed in two hash symbols (aka number signs): `#`. There are two formats that are independent of the → development/locale: `MM/dd/yyyy` and `yyyy-MM-dd`.

A time also comes in two formats: `hh:mm:ss` (0-23 hours) or `hh:mm:ss xM` (0-12 hours).
