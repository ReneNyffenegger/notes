$ VBA datatypes

  • byte
  • boolean
  • currency
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date]
  • decimal
  • double
  • integer: 4 bytes with sign.
  • long: 8 bytes with sign
  • longLong
  • longPtr
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object] (such as → Microsoft/Office/Excel[excel] objects, or user objects in *class modules*)
  • single. Other → development/languages[programming languages] might call this data type a *float*.
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant] (The actual type of the variable is determined at run time rather than compile time)

Apparently, VBA does not have a *char* datatype. `byte` might be used instead.

Except of the `byte` datatype, there are no unsigned datypes.

At runtime, the type name of a variable can be determined with → development/languages/VBA/functions/typeName[`typeName(var)`].

{ Declaring data types of variables and constants

  The data type of vaiables can be declared with the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/dim[`dim`] statement.

  gh|about-VBA|/language/datatypes/declaring.bas||

  The `deftype` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement] allows to specify the default type at module level.

  The data type can also be indicated with the following symbols:
    • `%`: integer
    • `&`: long
    • `@`: currency
    • `!`: single
    • `#`: double
    • `$`: string
