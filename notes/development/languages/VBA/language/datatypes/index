$ VBA data types

All VBA → development/languages/VBA/language/variables[variable] data types are compatible with the *variant* datatype that is defined by OLE Automation.

The VBA data types are:
  • byte
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[boolean]
  • currency
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date]
  • decimal (not declarable)
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double[double]
  • `error` (?: `dim e as error` is possible…)
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/integer[integer]: 4 bytes with sign.
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/long[long]: 4 bytes with sign
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/longLong[longLong]: 8 bytes
  • longPtr
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object] (such as → Microsoft/Office/Excel[excel] objects, or user objects in *class modules*) (TODO: aka »object reference«?)
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/single[single]. Other → development/languages[programming languages] might call this data type a *float*.
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string]
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant] (The actual type of the variable is determined at run time rather than compile time)
Additionally, the `type` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement] allows to create a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/user-defined[user defined datatype].

Each data type has a *default value* to which a variable is initialized when it is created.

Apparently, VBA does not have a `char` datatype. `byte` might be used instead.

A variable cannot be declared as `decimal`. Instead, the variable needs to be declared as `variant` and assigned to with `→ development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-cDec[cDec]("42.1234")`.

Except of the `byte` datatype, there are no unsigned datypes.

At runtime, the type of a variable can be determined with → development/languages/VBA/functions/typeName[`typeName(var)`] and
→ development/languages/VBA/functions/varType[`varType(var)`].

{ Declaring data types of variables and constants

  The data type of vaiables can be declared with the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/dim[`dim`] statement.

  The `deftype` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement] allows to specify the default type at module level.

  The data type can also be indicated with the following symbols:
    • `%`: integer
    • `&`: long
    • `@`: currency
    • `!`: single
    • `#`: double
    • `$`: string
