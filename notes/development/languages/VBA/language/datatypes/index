$ VBA data types

All VBA → development/languages/VBA/language/variables[variable] data types are compatible with the *variant* datatype that is defined by OLE Automation.

The VBA data types are:
table { lll
  ~Name~ ☰ ~Comments~ ☰ ~Constant~ (`vbVarType` enumeration)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/byte ☰ ☰ `vbByte` (15)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[boolean] ☰ ☰ `vbBoolean` (11)
  currency ☰ ☰ `vbCurrency` (6)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] ☰ ☰ `vbDate` (7)
  decimal ☰ (not declarable) ☰ `vbDecimal` (14)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double[double] ☰ ☰ `vbDouble` (5)
  `error` ☰ (?: `dim e as error` is possible…) ☰ `vbError` (10)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/integer[integer] ☰ 4 bytes with sign ☰ `vbInteger` (2)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/long[long] ☰ 4 bytes with sign ☰ `vbLong` (3)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/longLong[longLong] ☰ 8 bytes (present only on 64-bit platforms) ☰ `vbLongLong` (20)
  longPtr ☰ ☰
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object] ☰ such as → Microsoft/Office/Excel[excel] objects, or user objects in *class modules*) (TODO: aka »object reference«? ☰ `vbObject` (9)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/single[single] ☰ Other → development/languages[programming languages] might call this data type a *float* ☰ `vbSingle` (4)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string] ☰ ☰ `vbString` (8)
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant] ☰ The actual type of the variable is determined at run time rather than compile time ☰ `vbVariant` (12). Only used when added to `vbArray`.
  array ☰ ☰ `vbArray` (8192). This value is never returned by → development/languages/VBA/functions/varType[`varType()`], instead, the type-number of the elements in the array is added to 8192.
  null ☰ ☰ `vbNull` (1)
  empty ☰ ☰ `vbEmpty` (0)
  data access object ☰ ☰ `vbDataObject` (13)
  user defined objects ☰ ☰ `vbUserDefinedType` (36)
table }
Additionally, the `type` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement] allows to create a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/user-defined[user defined datatype].

Each data type has a *default value* to which a variable is initialized when it is created.

Apparently, VBA does not have a `char` datatype. `byte` might be used instead.

A variable cannot be declared as `decimal`. Instead, the variable needs to be declared as `variant` and assigned to with `→ development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-cDec[cDec]("42.1234")`.

Except of the `byte` datatype, there are no unsigned datypes.

At runtime, the type of a variable can be determined with → development/languages/VBA/functions/typeName[`typeName(var)`] and
→ development/languages/VBA/functions/varType[`varType(var)`].

{ Declaring data types of variables and constants

  The data type of vaiables can be declared with the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/dim[`dim`] statement.

  The `deftype` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement] allows to specify the default type at module level.

  The data type can also be indicated with the following symbols:
    • `%`: integer
    • `&`: long
    • `@`: currency
    • `!`: single
    • `#`: double
    • `$`: string
