$ VBA: datatype variant
@ variant

The *actual* datatype of a variant variable is determined at runtime. Hence the name.

{ empty / null

  There are two variant → development/languages/VBA/language/identifier/literal[literal identifiers]: → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-empty[`empty`] and
  → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-null[`null`].

  As long as a variant variable is unitizlied, it is said to be
  → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-empty[empty]. → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-isEmpty[`isEmpty()`] can be used to determine if a variant was initialized.

  A variant (as opposed to all other → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[VBA data types]) can be set to `null` to specificilly indicate the absence of any value or invalid data.

  If the «value» of a variant is `empty` or `null` can be tested with the → development/languages/VBA/functions/isX[`isEmpty()` and `isNull()`] function.
