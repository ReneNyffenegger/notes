$ VBA: creation of objects


In VBA, → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[objects] are created with either
  → development/languages/VBA/language/operators/new[`new`] or → development/languages/VBA/functions/createObject[`createObject`].

{ new vs createObject

  With `new`, the VBA runtime knows the CLSID (class id) when the object is created.
  -
  With `createObject`, the runtime first has to look up the CLSID via the *progId* in the → Windows/registry[registry].

  `new` returns the default → Windows/development/COM[COM] interface which is specified in the respective typelib.
  -
  `createObject` returns either an → development/languages/VBA/IUnknown/IDispatch[IDispatch] (if available) or
  a → development/languages/VBA/IUnknown[IUnknown].
