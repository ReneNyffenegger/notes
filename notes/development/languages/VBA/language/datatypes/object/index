$ VBA: datatype object
@ object

A VBA object consists of the following *members*:
  • variables
  • procedures (»methods«)
  • → development/languages/VBA/language/classes/event[events]

An object represents an → development/languages/VBA/IUnknown/IDispatch[IDispatch] interface.


There is one object → development/languages/VBA/language/identifier/literal[literal identifiers]: `nothing`.
-
An object variable is considered to be → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-nothing[nothing] if its reference count is 0. In such cases,
→ development/languages/VBA/functions/objPtr[`objPtr`] returns 0.

Each object is identified by a value whose value type is *object reference*.

The pointer to the → development/languages/VBA/IUnknown[IUnknown] interface is returned by the → development/languages/VBA/functions/objPtr[`objPtr`] function.

{ TODO

  As per Don Box's *Advanced Visual Basic 6*, an instance of an object requires (at least) 96 bytes.
  -
  The first four (32 Bit Windows?) seem to store a pointer to a *virtual table* (→ development/languages/VBA/IUnknown[`IUnknown`]).
  -
  The next four (32 Bit Windows?) seem to store the reference count for that object (See the → development/languages/VBA/language/classes/reference-counting[reference counting test]).

}

sa:

  Functions → development/languages/VBA/functions/createObject[`createObject`], → development/languages/VBA/functions/typeOf-is[`typeOf … is`] and → development/languages/VBA/functions/objPtr[`objPtr`].
  -
  Operator → development/languages/VBA/language/operators/new[`new`]

  → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[classes]

  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[datatypes]

  The → development/languages/VBA/language/module/class/me[`me` keyword] evaluates to the respective object in a → development/languages/VBA/language/classes#vba-member-functions[member procedure/function].
