$ VBA: datatype object

A VBA object consists of the following *members*:
  • variables
  • procedures (»methods«)
  • events

An object represents an → development/languages/VBA/IUnknown/IDispatch[IDispatch] interface.

An object variable is considered to be → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-nothing[nothing] if its reference count is 0. In such cases,
→ development/languages/VBA/functions/xPtr#xptr-object[`objPtr`] returns 0.

{ TODO

  As per Don Box's *Advanced Visual Basic 6*, an instance of an object requires (at least) 96 bytes.
  -
  The first four (32 Bit Windows?) seem to store a pointer to a *virtual table* (→ development/languages/VBA/IUnknown[`IUnknown`]).
  -
  The next four (32 Bit Windows?) seem to store the reference count for that object (See the → development/languages/VBA/language/classes/reference-counting[reference counting test]).
