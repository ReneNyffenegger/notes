$ VBA: User defined data types

In addition to the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[built-in data types], Visual Basic for Applications allows to create *user defined* datatypes with
the `type` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement].

code {
type UDT
     e_lng as long
     e_str as string
end  type

dim v as UDT
v.e_lng = 42
…
code }

{ Internal memory layout

  Investigations using → development/languages/VBA/functions/xPtr[varPtr()] indicate that VBA doesn't waste memory when using user defined types:
