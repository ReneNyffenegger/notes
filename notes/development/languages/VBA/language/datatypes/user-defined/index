$ VBA: User defined data types

In addition to the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[built-in data types], Visual Basic for Applications allows to create *user defined* datatypes (sometimes referred to as *UDT*).

{ Declararing user defined types

  A user defined type is declared with the `type` → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement]:
code {
type UDT
     e_lng as long
     e_str as string
end  type

dim v as UDT
v.e_lng = 42
…
code }

  Types can be declared `global` or `private`.

}
{ Returning from a function

  A type can be returned from a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[function]:
  gh|about-VBA|/language/datatypes/user-defined/return-from-function.vb||


}
{ Limitations

  One of the biggest limitations of user defined data types is, imho, that they cannot be used as values in → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Scripting-Runtime/dictionary[dictionaries].

}
