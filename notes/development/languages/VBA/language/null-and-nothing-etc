$ VBA: Null and nothing etc.

code {
if obj is nothing then
   …
end if
code }

Then, there is also the `isNull` and → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-isEmpty[`isEmpty`] → development/languages/VBA/functions[function] and the special values `null`, `vbNull`, `empty` and `vbEmpty`.
-
There is even a `vbNullString` and a `vbNullChar`

{ nothing #vba-nothing

  `nothing` is only applicable to → development/languages/VBA/language/variables[variables] that are declared as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[objects] or → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant].

  An object variable is considered *nothing* if its reference count is zero. For such variables, → development/languages/VBA/functions/xPtr#xptr-object[`objPtr`] returns 0.

}
{ empty #vba-empty

  An *empty* → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant/index[variant] indicates that the variable is not yet initialized with a value.

  Such a variable evaluates to `0` (zero) in numeric and to `""` (empty string) in string context.

}
{ null

  The value *null* indicates that a variable contains unvalid data.

  Any operation that involves null values evaluates to null.
