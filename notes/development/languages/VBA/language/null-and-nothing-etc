$ VBA: Null and nothing etc.

code {
if obj is nothing then
   …
end if
code }

Then, there is also the `isNull` → development/languages/VBA/functions[function] and the special values `null`, `vbNull`, `empty` and `vbEmpty`.
-
There is even a `vbNullString` and a `vbNullChar`


{ nothing #vba-nothing

 `nothing` is a → development/languages/VBA/language/identifier/literal[literal identifier] that is only applicable to → development/languages/VBA/language/variables[variables] that are declared as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[objects]
 or → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant].

 The value `nothing` represents an object whose *object reference* (which seems to be a memory address) is 0.

? An object variable is considered *nothing* if its reference count is zero. For such variables, → development/languages/VBA/functions/objPtr[`objPtr`] returns 0.

}
{ empty #vba-empty

  An *empty* → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant/index[variant] indicates that the variable is not yet initialized with a value.

  Such a variable evaluates to `0` (zero) in numeric and to `""` (empty string) in string context.

  In order to test whether a variant is empty, the special function → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-isEmpty[`isEmpty(…)`] can be used.

 `empty` (like `nothing`) is a → development/languages/VBA/language/identifier/literal[literal identifier].

}
{ null

  The value *null* indicates that a variable contains unvalid data.

  Any operation that involves null values evaluates to null.
