$ VBA: Microsoft Scripting Runtime - FileSystemObject

{ Create or delete text file

  The following simple example uses `fileExists` to check whether a given file exists.

  If it exits, it deletes it using `deleteFile`.

  If the file does not exist, it first creates a text file using `createTextFile` which returns a `textStream` object. With this object's `writeLine` methods, some text lines can be
  added to the newly created text file.
  -
  Finally, the file (text stream) is closed.
