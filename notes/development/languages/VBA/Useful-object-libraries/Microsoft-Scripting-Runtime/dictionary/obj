$ VBA: dictionaries and objects

Here are two examples that try to demonstrate how → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[objects] can be used as values or keys in
→ development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Scripting-Runtime/dictionary[dictionaries].

{ Values are objects

  gh|about-VBA|/object-libraries/microsoft-scripting-runtime/dictionary/dict-of-obj/obj.cls||

  gh|about-VBA|/object-libraries/microsoft-scripting-runtime/dictionary/dict-of-obj/prog.bas||

}
{ Keys are objects #vba-dict-key-obj

  This example uses the same object than the previous example, but uses the object to index strings rather than using strings to index objects:

}
