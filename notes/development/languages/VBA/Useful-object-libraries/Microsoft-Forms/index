$ VBA: Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library

{ Adding a reference to the Forms library

  In order to use the Forms library in a → development/languages/VBA project, A references to the *Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library* must be added, for example by entering one of the following lines in the
  immediate window:
code {
application.vbe.activeVBProject.references.addFromFile "C:\Windows\System32\FM20.dll"
application.vbe.activeVBProject.references.addFromFile "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\FM20.dll"

application.vbe.activeVBProject.references.addFromGuid "{0D452EE1-E08F-101A-852E-02608C4D0BB4}", 2, 0
code }

  Note, that this → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL] does neither exist under `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Window\SysWOW64`, but it is found under
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Office/root/vfs/SystemX86/FM20_dll[`C:\Windows\dirs\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\vfs\SystemX86\FM20.dll`]

  It is not necessary to add manually add the reference if a *UserForm* is added to a project in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor[VB Editor]. In that case, the Editor
  → https://stackoverflow.com/a/35610430/180275[will automatically add the required reference].

  After adding the reference, constants such as `fmBorderStyleSingle` or `fmBackStyleTransparent` become available.
