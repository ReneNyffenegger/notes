$ VBA: TypeLib Information

Get the properties and functions of a → development/languages/VBA[VBA Object] with → Windows/development/COM/type-library information.

It seems that recent versions of Office(?) or Windows(?) require the → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/version/edition/Common7/IDE/vstblinf_dll[`vstblinf.dll`] to read a type library in
→ development/languages/VBA. This → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL can be found under
→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/version/edition/Common7/IDE[`%DevEnvDir%`], for example `c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\vstlbinf.dll`.

Unfortunately, I was unable to run the following example with `vstlbinf.dll` (Runtime error 429, *ActiveX component can't create object*).

Call the function like so
code {
propertiesOfObj → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[application]
code }
