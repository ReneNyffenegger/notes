$ Msxml2.XMLHTTP: get.vbs

`get.vbs` is a simple script (written in → development/languages/VBScript) that allows to `GET` a → development/web/HTTP ressource
from → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe] and print it to the console.

In order for it to work, it needs to be run with `cscript.exe` rather than `wscript.exe` because otherwise, `wscript.echo` does not write the console but opens a message box.
