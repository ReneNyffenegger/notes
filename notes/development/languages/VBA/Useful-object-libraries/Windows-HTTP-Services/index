{ Adding reference for Microsoft WinHTTP Services

  In order to programatically add the reference in a VBA project, the following code might be used:
code {
call application.VBE.activeVBProject.references.addFromGuid("{662901fc-6951-4854-9eb2-d9a2570f2b2e}", 5, 1)
code }

}

  The following → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] example tries to make a → development/web/HTTP GET request.

  gh|about-VBA|/object-libraries/Windows-HTTP-Services/GET.bas||

  Compare with the corresponding → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/MSXML#msxml-GET[MSXML example].
