$ VBA: Windows Script Host

Programatically adding the reference to the → development/languages/WSH[Windows Script Host] object model (`C:\Windows\SysWOW64\wshom.ocs`) to a VBA project:
code {
thisWorkbook.VBProject.references.addFromGuid _
        GUID   :="{F935DC20-1CF0-11D0-ADB9-00C04FD58A0B}" , _
        major  :=  1                                      , _
        minor  :=  0
code }


{ Show environment variables #vba-wsh-show-env-vars

  The following scriptlet shows → development/environment-variable[environment variables]:
  gh|about-VBA|/object-libraries/windows-script-host/environment.bas||

}
{ TODO

  This page should probably be merged with → development/languages/WSH

}

sa:

  Don't confuse `wScript.shell` with → Windows/development/COM/Useful-object-libraries/Shell-Automation-Service[`shell.application` (Shell Automation Service)].

  → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries
