$ VBA: line continuation

In → development/languages/VBA, a → development/languages/VBA/language/statements[statement] typically extends to the end of line. In order to span a statement over multiple lines, the unserscore (`_`) must be used. In VBA's terminology, this character is also
referred to as *line continuation character*.

There's in arbitrary limit of 25 lines that can be continued. Trying to exceed this limit results in a → development/languages/VBA/line-continuation/Too-many-line-continuations[Too many line continuations] error.
