$ VBA Runtime 7: rtcErrObj 

The VBA 7 runtime function `rtcErrObj` returns the → development/languages/VBA/objects/err[`err` (error) object].

In the following example, the `rtcErrObj` function is accessed via the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/declare[`declare`] statement to assign an
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object] (more precisely: the `err` object] to the `objErr` variable.
-
Then, the address to the → development/languages/VBA/IUnknown[IUnknown] interface of `errObj` (which is returned by → development/languages/VBA/functions/objPtr[`objPtr`])
is compared with the address of the same interface of `err`. Since both addresses are the same, we have showed that indeed both objects are the same.
