$ Examples for Visual Basic for Application accessing the Windows API: EnumChildWindows

This is a desperate attempt to recursively enumarate all Windows using the WinAPI function `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/user32_dll/EnumChildWindows`. It somehow works, but not as elegantly as I hoped.

This example needs the VBA declarations of the Windows API which can be found
