$ Examples for Visual Basic for Application accessing the Windows API: ShellExecute

This example → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/open[creates two files] and then
opens them by calling `ShellExecute`.

The first file is opened by passing its filename as `lpFile`. Windows will then use the default
application for `.txt` file to open the file. By default, this is notepad.

Then, `ShellExecute` is invoked by passing `notepad.exe` as `lpFile` argument and the filename of the file to be opened
as `lpParameters` argument. Thus, it makes sure that the file is opened with notepad.

This example needs the VBA declarations of the Windows API which can be found
