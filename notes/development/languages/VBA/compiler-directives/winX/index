$ VBA: win16, win32 and win64 predefined compiler directive constants

VBA defines some of the predefined → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/const[compiler directive constants] depending on the bitness of → Microsoft/Office that hosts the VBA environment.

This allows a programmer to create specific code for the target bitness sing → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/conditional-compilation[`#if winX then … #end if`].

The win16, win32 and win64 have the following truthy values on different bitness environments:

table { llll
