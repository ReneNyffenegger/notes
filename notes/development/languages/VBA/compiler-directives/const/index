$ VBA: The #const compiler directive

gh|about-VBA|/compiler-directives/const.bas||

{ Predefined constants #vba-predefined-compiler-constants

  Possibly predefined constants seem to be:
    • `vba6`
    • `vba7`
    • → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/winX[`win16`]
    • → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/winX[`win32`]
    • → development/languages/VBA/compiler-directives/winX[`win64`]
    • `mac`

  The `win16`, `win32` and `win64` constants identify the bitness of → Microsoft/Office[Office] not of the actual → Windows being run.
