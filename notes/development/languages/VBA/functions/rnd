$ VBA function: rnd

`rnd(…)` creates a *random number* between 0 and 1 which is of type → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/single[single].

If the argument is missing or greater than zero, it returns the next number in the sequence.

If the argument is 0, it returns the last generated number.

If the argument is less than 0, it always returns the same number for the same argument.

In order to *repeatedly create the same sequence of random numbers*, an application should first call `rnd(n)` with a specifically chosen negative number and then call
`randomize(m)` with a specifically chosen numeric argument. (The created sequence is thus depending on the chosen values of `n` and `m`).


sa:
  `randomize(…)` initializes the random-number egenerator with an optional seed.
