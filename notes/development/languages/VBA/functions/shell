$ VBA function: Shell

→ development/languages/VBA/functions/shell[`shell`] can be used to start a program (application).

code {
shell path
shell path, windowStyle
code }

The returned *task id* is a `→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double` (!) and identifies the started → Windows/development/process (and is sometimes also referred to as PID or process ID).
-
This task id can for example be used in the  → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/appActivate[`appActivate`] statement.

`windowStyle` is one of
table { lll
  `vbHide` ☰ 0 ☰
  `vbNormalFocus` ☰ 1 ☰
  `vbMinimizedFocus` ☰ 2 ☰ The default if omitted
  `vbMaximizedFocus` ☰ 3 ☰
  `vbNormalNoFocus` ☰ 4 ☰
  `vbMinimizedNoFocus` ☰ 6 ☰
table }

In the following example, `shell` is used in the `startTask` → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub] to start an instance of → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/notepad_exe.

In `end task`, → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/taskkill_exe[`taskkill.exe`] is executed with the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/taskkill_exe#taskkill-pid[`/PID`] flag to kill the freshly started notepad process.
