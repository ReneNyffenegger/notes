$ VBA function: Shell

→ development/languages/VBA/functions/shell[`shell`] can be used to start a program (application).

The returned *task id* identifies the started → Windows/development/process (and is sometimes also referred to as PID or process ID).
-
This task id can for example be used in the  → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/appActivate[`appActivate`] statement.

In the following example, `shell` is used in the `startTask` → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub] to start an instance of → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/notepad_exe.

In `end task`, → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/taskkill_exe[`taskkill.exe`] is executed with the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/taskkill_exe#taskkill-pid[`/PID`] flag to kill the freshly started notepad process.
