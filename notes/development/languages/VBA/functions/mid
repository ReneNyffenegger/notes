$ VBA function: mid

`mid(text, start, len)` extracts the portion from the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string `text` that starts at character `start` and has `len` characters.
-
Thus, `mid()` is the equivalent of the function which is called → development/languages/Perl/functions/substr[`substr`], `substring` or similar in other → development/languages[programming languages].

`start` must be greater than zero. `mid(text, 0, n)` causes a runtime error 5 (*Invalid procedure call or argument*).

code {
dim result as string
result = mid("The foo bar", 5, 3) ' Assign "foo" to result.
code }

{ Assigning a value to the result of mid

  The result of `mid` is an l-value and thus can be assigned, albeit in a limited fashion: only a text of the length of the replaced text is replaced:
