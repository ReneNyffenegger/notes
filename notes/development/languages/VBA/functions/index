}
{ isEmpty #vba-isEmpty

  `isEmpty` can be used to determine if a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant] was initialized. On other
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[datatypes], this seems not possible (or probably more accuratly, they are automatically initialized).
  -
  The following example displays that the variant variable is empty but the others are not.

  Apparently, `isEmpty` is used in → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] to determine if a cell is empty.
