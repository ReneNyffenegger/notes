$ VBA: cStr

`cStr(arg)` is a → development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion[conversion function] and converts `arg` into a
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string data type].

The format of the string is dependent on the → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[data type] of `arg` which I try to demonstrate with the following
simple example:
