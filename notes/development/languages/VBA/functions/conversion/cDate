$ VBA: cDate / cvDate

code {
function cDate (expr as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant) as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date
function cvDate(expr as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant) as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant
code }

`cDate(dt)` and `cvDate(dt)` are → development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion[conversion functions]: they both convert `dt` to a
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[`date`].

The difference between these functions is that `cDate` returns a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] and
`cvDate` returns a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant]. Thus, the expression `cvDate(null)` is
valid while `cDate(null)` raises run-time error 94: *Invalid use of Null*.

If `dt` is a numeric type, it is interpreted (cast) as → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/double[`double`] which represents (fractional) days since
midnight 1899-12-30 (See → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date#vba-date-internal[here]).
-
If `dt` it is a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[`string`], it is tried to be interpreted according to the → Windows/development/Internationalization/locale[locale] currently in effect (which is not always possible).
