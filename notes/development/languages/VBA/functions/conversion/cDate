$ VBA: cDate / cvDate

`cDate(dt)` and `cvDate(dt)` are → development/languages/VBA/functions/conversion[conversion functions]: they both convert `dt` to a
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date].

The difference between these functions is that `cDate` returns a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] and
`cvDate` returns a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant[variant]. Thus, the expression `cvDate(null)` is
valid while `cDate(null)` raises run-time error 94: *Invalid use of Null*.
