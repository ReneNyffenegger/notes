$ VBA function: callByName

`callByName` gets or sets an → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object's] property or executes an object's method. The name of the property or method are dynamic (i.e. might
be stored in a → development/languages/VBA/language/variables.

`callByName` operates on → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[classes/objects]. So, we need to first create a class:
gh|about-VBA|/functions/callByName/tq84Obj.bas||

Now, we can call methods/subs etc on the class with `callByName`:
gh|about-VBA|/functions/callByName/callMethodByName.bas||

In → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] forms, the special keyword `me` can be used to refer to *itself*.

In order to dynamically call → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[ordinary subs], use
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/run[application.run] (if the function runs in → Microsoft/Office/Excel, → Microsoft/Office/Word etc.)

sa:

  → development/languages/VBA/functions[VBA functions]
