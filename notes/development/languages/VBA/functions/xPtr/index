  The → development/languages/VBA/runtime-lib[VBA runtime library] function `GetMem1` allows to inspect the values of the addresses (pointers) returned by `varPtr` and `strPtr` when applied on
  → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[strings].

  It turns out that the pointer returned with `varPtr` points the the memory location that is returned by `strPtr`.
