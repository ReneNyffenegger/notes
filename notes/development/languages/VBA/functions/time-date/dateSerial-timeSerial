$ VBA: dateSerial() and timeSerial()

`dateSerial(year, month, day)` constructs a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] from the three integers `year`, `month` and `day`.

`timeSerial(hr, mi, ss)` creates a time (of datatype → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date]) whose hour is `hr`, minute is `mi` and second is `ss`.

By combining `dateSerial` and `timeSerial`, it's possible to construct any VBA → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date[date] from its six components. This is demonstrated
in the function → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/date/convert-UTC-text-to-date[`UTCStringToDate()`].
