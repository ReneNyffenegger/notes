$ VBA: the Err object
@ Err

The `err` → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object] is a *singleton*: exactly *one* instance of it is alway present. It has global scope. (Technically, it is a *global class module*.)

The `err` object is reset with the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error[`on error`] statement.

  The following simple example divides 42 by 0, which, *of course*, will throw an error.
  -
  In the case of an error, the error handler (`on error goto failed` and `failed:`) will then print the `Err` object's properties:
  gh|about-VBA|/objects/err/show.bas||
  
}
{ Raising a user error

  An error (what other → development/languages[programming languages] possibly might call an *exception*) is raised with `error.raise`:
code {
err.raise errorNumber, source, description, helpFile, helpContext
code }

  All parameters except `errorNumber` are → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/optional-parameters[optional].

{ Clearing the err object #clearing-err-object

  The error object can be cleared with `err.clear()`.

 `err.clear` is invoked behind the scenes at any of the following events:
    • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/resume[`resume`] statement
    • When a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub or function] is left (`exit sub`, `exit function`, `end sub`, `end function`).
    •`exit` property
    • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error[`on error`] statement

}

  The `err` object is also returned from the → development/languages/VBA/runtime-lib/VBE7[VBE7 runtime] function → development/languages/VBA/runtime-lib/VBE7/rtcErrObj[`rtcErrObj()`].
