$ VBA: the err object

The `err` → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object] is a *singleton*: exactly *one* instance of it is alway present. It has global scope. (Technically, it is a *global class module*.)

The `err` object is reset with the → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error[`on error`] statement.

{ Raising a user error

}
{ Clearing the err object #clearing-err-object

  The error object can be cleared with `err.clear()`.

 `err.clear` is invoked behind the scenes at any of the following events:
    • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/resume[`resume`] statement
    • When a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub or function] is left (`exit sub`, `exit function`, `end sub`, `end function`).
    •`exit` property
    • → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/on-error[`on error`] statement

}
