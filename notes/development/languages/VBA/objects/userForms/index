$ VBA: UserForms

`UserForms` is a global intrinsic variable that is provided by → development/languages/VBA. This variable is a collection that contains all loaded `MSForms.UserForm` objects of an application.

`UserForms` is technically a property of the `global` object. Its data type is `→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object`.
code {
debug.print (typename(vba.global.userForms))
debug.print (typename(vba.userForms))
debug.print (typename(userForms))
code }

{ TODO

  Is `userForms` somehow related with the `userForm` object found in the → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Forms[forms library]?

}

  The → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/load-unload[VBA statements `load` and `unload`].
