`UserForms` is a global intrinsic variable that is provided by → development/languages/VBA. This variable is a collection that contains all loaded `MSForms.UserForm` objects of an application.

`UserForms` is technically a property of the `global` object:

debug.print (typename(vba.userForms))
debug.print (typename(userForms))
code }
