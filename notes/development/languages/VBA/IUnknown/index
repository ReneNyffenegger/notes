$ IUnknown (VBA)
@ IUnknown

Although `Windows/development/COM/IUnknown` seems to play a rather important role in VBA, it is not mentioned in the VBA specification.

{ Call function when Excel exits

  On → development/version-control-systems/git/github[Github], I found an interesting
  → https://github.com/kumatti1/COM_Test/blob/master/Module1.bas[gist] by → https://github.com/kumatti1[kumatti1] that somehow makes use of the → Windows/development/COM/IUnknown[IUnknown interface]: after running `main` in
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel], the function `release` will be executed when Excel is closed.

  Unfortunately, I don't really get how this works …

  It seems(!) that `IUnknown` is exhibited through the `stdole` «library»
code {
dim unk as stdole.iUnknown
code }

}
