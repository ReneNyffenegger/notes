Although `IUnknown` seems to play a rather important role in VBA, it is not mentioned in the VBA specification.

{ Call function when excel exits

  On → development/version-control-systems/git/github/index[Github], I found an interesting
  → https://github.com/kumatti1/COM_Test/blob/master/Module1.bas[gist] by → https://github.com/kumatti1[kumatti1] that somehow makes use of the → Windows/development/COM/IUnknown[IUnknown interface]: after running `main` in
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel], the function `release` will be executed when Excel is closed.

  Unfortunately, I don't really get how this works …
