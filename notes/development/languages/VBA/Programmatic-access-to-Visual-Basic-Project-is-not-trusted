? Apparently, in order to use the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model[object model] of the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor[Visual Basic Editor], access needs to be granted.

Otherwise, a run-time rror *1004* (~Programmatic access to Visual Basic Project is not trusted~) can be turned off in the *Trust Center*) is thrown.

Access can be granted int the *Trust Center*:
-
File -> Options -> Trust Center
-
click on *Trust Center Settings* then on
-
*Trust access to the VBA project object model*.
