$ Accessing and calling DLLs from VBA: passing null pointers

This is a test that I used to check if I can pass null pointers to a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL] from
→ development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications].

This is apparently possible if the pointer argument is declared `→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/byVal-byRef[byRef]` and the special type `any`.
