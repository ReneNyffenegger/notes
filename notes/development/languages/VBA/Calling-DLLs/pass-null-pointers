$ Accessing and calling DLLs from VBA: passing null pointers

This is a test that I used to check if I can pass null pointers to a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL] from
→ development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications].

This is apparently possible if the pointer argument is declared `→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/byVal-byRef[byRef]` and the special type `any` in the
VBA `declare` statement.

{ dll.c

  This is the c source for the DLL. It has one function (or *entry point*): `asAny`. The function takes one argument: a simple pointer (`void*`).

  The function returns false if the pointer was a *null pointer* and true (or more exactly `-1` which seems to be the VBA equivalent for `true`) otherwise.

  Additionally, when the pointer was not null, it is assumed to be a pointer to a wstr (or an `OLECHAR` (?)). A message box then prints the address that the pointer
  points at as well as the string value at that address.

}
{ call-the-dll.bas

  This is the source code that calls the DLL.

  The argument `pointer` of the DLL function `asAny` is declared with the special type `any` that seems to be necessary in order to be able to pass null pointers.

}
{ Output

  The VBA program calls `asAny` three times.

  The first time, it calls it with → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc[`nothing`]. This is passed as *null pointer* to the DLL and consequently,
  the DLL returns false.

  The second time, the function is called with the special constant `vbNullString`. Also this value is passed as *null pointer* to the DLL and again, the function
  return false.

  In the third time, the function is called with a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string]. This is passed as an actual pointer. Hence,
  the DLL displays a message box and returns true.

{ dll.def

  This is the *def file* that is needed create a DLL with undecorated names when compiling with the Microsoft `cl` compiler.
