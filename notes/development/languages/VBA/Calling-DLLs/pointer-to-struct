$ Accessing and calling DLLs from VBA: Pointer to structs

This test aims at trying to pass a `type` (`struct` in c) to  a  → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL].

{ dll.c

  The DLL defines a struct (named `FOO`) and a function `passPtrToFOO` which takes a pointer to this struct.

  If the pointer passed to the function is a null pointer, the function just displays a message box that a null pointer was passed.

  If a non-null pointer is passed, the function displays a message box with the values of the stuct elements.

}
{ call-the-dll.bas

  This is the → development/languages/VBA[VBA] program that uses the DLL.

  First, a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/user-defined[type] is defined that matches the `struct` in the DLL.
  
  It then declares three aliases for the function so that (a pointer) to the type (or a null pointer)  can be passed to the DLL function
  either `as FOO`, `as any` or `as longPtr`.

  It then declares a variable (`f`, which is a `FOO`) and initializes its members.

{ Running the VBA program

  The function is then ready to call the DLL function.

  First, `f` is passed `as FOO`. The DLL receives a pointer to the struct and is able to display the values of the members of the struct. Note: VBA automagically converts its BSTR strings to `char*` for the
  DLL:

  The second call uses `passPtrFOOasAny` to demonstrate that `f` can also be passed to the DLL `as any`. The DLL displays the same message box.

  The third call tries pass a null pointer to the DLL. However, the intent fails. The DLL receives a pointer to an unitialized struct and displays

  However, a null pointer can be passed by calling the function `as longPtr`.

  Lastly, the function is called with → development/languages/VBA/functions/xPtr[`varPtr()`]. This passes a pointer to the struct to the DLL, but the `BSTR` is not converted to a `char*`, thus, the
  DLL displays the following message box:
