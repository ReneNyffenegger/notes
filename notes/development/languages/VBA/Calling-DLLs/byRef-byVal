$ Accessing and calling DLLs from VBA: passing parameters byRef and byVal

This is a test that hopefully demonstrates how values can be passed to and from a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL] using
→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/byVal-byRef[`byRef` and `byVal`].

The function `diff_double` takes two doubles, displays them in a message box and calculates
their difference and returns it.
-
In VBA, the doubles that are passed to the function need to be passed with the `byVal` option.

The function `swap_double_ptr` takes to pointers to doubles, hence their values must be
passsed to the function with the `byRef` option.
-
Since the arguments are passed by reference, the function can modify their value. This is what
the function does: it swaps their values.

The function `to_upper_char_ptr` takes a pointer to a `char`. Thus a string can be passed to this
function. Although the function expects a pointer, in the special case of strings, they need
to be passed with `byVal` anyway.

The function `bits_in_long` shows which bits are set in a long. I needed that to verify that a VBA constant
like `&h80000051` has the highest most bit set when assigned to a `long` → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes[datatype].

The functions (also subs) that VBA calls need to be declared in the VBA source code with the `declare` statement.
-
This statement identifies the physical location of the DLL, the entry points (functions) and calling conventions (`byVal` vs `byRef`).

{ The source code for the DLL

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/byRef-byVal/dll.c||

}
{ The VBA source that calls the DLL

  This is the VBA code that calls the DLL.

  Note that either the DLL needs to be in the `PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable] or that the path to the DLL needs to be explicitely stated in the `declare` statement.

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/byRef-byVal/call-the-dll.bas||

}
{ The .def file for the Microsoft linker

  In order to compile (link) the DLL with Microsoft's tools, I needed the following `.def` file
  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/byRef-byVal/dll.def||

}
