$ Determining loaded modules from VBA

{ C program

  The following → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C code returns a two dimensional → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays[array] from a DLL to
  → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] with the names and handles of all currently loaded modules (DLLs):
  
  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/loadedModules/loadedModules.c||

}
{ VBA code

  The function in the DLL is used from VBA like so:
  
  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/loadedModules/loadedModules.bas||

}
{ Makefile

  This is a (gnu) → development/make/index[makefile] that allows to create the dll (at least with → Windows/development/MinGW[MinGW]):

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/loadedModules/Makefile||

}
