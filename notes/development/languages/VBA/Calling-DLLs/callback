$ Accessing and calling DLLs from VBA: Calling back to VBA functions from the DLL

When using → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs] from → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications], its also possible to call VBA functions from the DLL.
The DLL needs declare a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/language/datatypes/pointer/function[function pointer]. The VBA code needs to pass the address
of the function to be called with the → development/languages/VBA/language/operators/addressOf[`addressOf` operator].

{ dll.c

  The DLL exports two functions. `setCallbackFunction` allows VBA to specify which function it wants to have called back. `callCallbackFunction` then actually calls the
  callback function.

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/callback/dll.c||

}
{ call-the-dll.bas

  This is the VBA code that lets the DLL call back its callback function.

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/callback/call-the-dll.bas||

}
{ dll.def

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/callback/dll.def||

}
