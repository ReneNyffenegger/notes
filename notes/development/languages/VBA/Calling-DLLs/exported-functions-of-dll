$ Showing exported functions of a DLL in VBA

This is an attempt to create a DLL that can be accessed from → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] to determine the names of exported functions of a DLL.

The DLL has one exported function only: `funcsInDll`. It returns an → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays[array] of
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[strings]. (See → development/languages/VBA/Calling-DLLs/index.html#vba-dll-return-string-array[here] for a technique
to return such an array).

As usual, → https://stackoverflow.com/a/1128453/180275[a specific stackoverflow answer] was very helpful while developing the code for the DLL.

{ C program

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/funcsInDll/funcsInDll.c||

}
{ VBA code

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/funcsInDll/funcsInDll.bas||

}
{ Makefile

  gh|VBA-calls-DLL|/funcsInDll/Makefile||

}
