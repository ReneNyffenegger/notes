$ Apache Kafka

Kafka promises to handle *real-time data feeds* («Streaming») especially well. It is typically used as
  • Distributed commit log/Storage System (making replay possible)
  • Queuing/message broker
  • Pub-sub
  • Stream-processing

Kafka relies on the → development/web/TCP-IP protocol.

{ Terminology

  A *producer* sends messages.

  A *consumer* pulls (reads) messages.

  *Brokers* are the end points/nodes in Kafka clusters.

  Messages are organized into *topics* and stored in *partitions*.
  -
  Messages are stored in key/value pairs in the order or reception (that is: they're time-stamped).

{ Oracle SQL Access to Kafka
  
  With *Oracle SQL Access to Kafka (OSAK)*, Oracle external tables can connect to Kafka brokers and read Kafka records.

  Thus, Kafka data can be joined to data in Oracle Database tables.

  Note that Kafka data does not have to persist in Oracle Database to be queried.

  OSAK also enables you to load Kafka data into tables stored in Oracle Database.
