$ YARN Application

A YARN → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application[application] consists of three components
  • The → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/client[client]
  • The → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application-master[application master] (AM)
  • The → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[container]

{ Starting an application

  The (YARN) client asks the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Resource-manager[resource manager]
  to create a new → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application-master[application master] instance.
  -
  The client tells the resource manager what the application master's physical resource
  requirements are.

}
{ Available applications

  A fresh Hadoop installations comes with two applications:
    •  → development/Apache/Hadoop/MapReduce[MapReduce]
    •  DistributedShell

}
{ Application ID #application-id

  Influences the name for → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/log-files[log files].

  Finding ids of running(?) applications:
code {
yarn application -list
code }

  When an application is started, it will print something like
code {
16/06/19 20:42:07 INFO impl.YarnClientImpl: Submitted application application_1466361633780_0001
code }
that helps determine the application id (here: `application_1466361633780_0001`).

}

sa:
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/log-files[log files]  

  → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/writing-application
