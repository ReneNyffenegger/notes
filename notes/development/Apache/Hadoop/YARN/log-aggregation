$ YARN log aggregation

Log aggregation is enabled/disabled through the → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters[configuration parameter] → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-logaggregation-enable. By default, it is
disabled.

When log aggregation is enabled, it copies → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[container] → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/log-files[log files] into a Hadoop filesystem (most probably
→ development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS[HDFS]) after a → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application[application] has finished its job. The location is specified
by `$yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir/${user}/${yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir-suffix}/<application-id>` (
  see → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-remote-app-log-dir,
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-remote-app-log-dir-suffix,
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application#application-id[application id]
)
-
After copying the log files, the local log files are retained for → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-delete-debug-delay-sec seconds (possibly for 0 seconds).


When log aggregation is enabled, the parameter `yarn.log.server.url` (set in → Linux/fhs/usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/yarn-site_xml[yarn-site.xml]) should point at the
*job history server* in order for the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Resource-manager[resource manager] UI to be able to display logs.

{ Compression

  Aggregated log files can be compressed by setting the → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-log-aggregation-compression-type parameter.
