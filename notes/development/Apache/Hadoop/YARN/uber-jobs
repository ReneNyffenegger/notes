A job that runs within the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application-master[application master] is a ~uber job~. Seperate → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[containers] are not needed with uber jobs.

This might benefit if only small amount of data should be processed.

{ Configuration parameters

  → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#mapreduce-job-ubertask-enable (must be set to true to enable uber jobs)
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#mapreduce-job-ubertask-maxmaps,
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#mapreduce-job-ubertask-maxreduces,
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#mapreduce-job-ubertask-maxbytes
