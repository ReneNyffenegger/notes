*Node managers* run on every → development/Apache/Hadoop/node in a → development/Apache/Hadoop/cluster[cluster].

A *node manager* creates, supervises and terminates → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[containers].

When a node manager starts up, it registers itself with the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Resource-manager[resource manager] and
periodically sends a heart beat to the resource manager.o

{ Capacity

  The capacity of a node manager is
    • memory ( → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-resource-memory-mb)
    • number of vcores

  Since a node manager (at minimum) allocates → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-scheduler-minimum-allocation-mb per
    → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[container], the number of containers a node manager concurrently manages is roughly:
    -
    → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-resource-memory-mb /
    -
    → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-scheduler-minimum-allocation-mb
