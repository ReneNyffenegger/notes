YARN = Yet another resource negotiator.

YARN came with Hadoop version 2.
Until then, Hadoop only supported → development/Apache/Hadoop/MapReduce[MapReduce] for computational work.

With Hadoop 2, all Hadoop execution engines (such as → development/Apache/Spark/index[Spark] and even MapReduce itself) are actually a YARN application.

YARN is a distributed scheduler.
-
It provides resources such as CPUs and Memory to → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application[applications].

{ Main tasks for YARN

  The two main tasks for YARN are
    • Creating a → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container when requested by a client
    • Monitoring running containers, and finally terminating them

}
{ Components

  The two main components of YARN are
    • the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Resource-manager[resource manager]
    • the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Node-manager[node managers]

}

  → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application
