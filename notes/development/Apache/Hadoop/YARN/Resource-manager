In a non-HA environemnt, there is one *resource manager* per → development/Apache/Hadoop/cluster[cluster]. It manages the resources within the cluster and executes services (such
as the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Resource-scheduler[resource scheduler]).

The *resource manager* schedules → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[containers] (which in turn are created, supervised and terminated by a → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Node-manager[node manager]).

{ Services

  The resource manager runs a few services, some of which are
    • The resource scheduler
    • The → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application-master[application mater] liveness monitor
    • The → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Node-manager[node manager] liveness monitor
    • Event handlers

}

{ Hostname

  The hostname of the resource manager is configured by → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-resourcemanager-hostname.

}

{ Web application #rm-web-application

  The web application can be contacted on `http://${→ development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-resourcemanager-webapp-address}/cluster`
