$ YARN: log files

Each → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container[container] has a specific (local) *output directory* (on the → development/Apache/Hadoop/node[node] that the container is running on) into which *standard output*, *standard error* and *log messages* are written.
-
Standard out and standard error messages go to distinct files.


If → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/log-aggregation[log aggregation] is enabled (see → development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-logaggregation-enable), these log files are written to ${→ development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-log-dirs}/application-id/container-id (See
  → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application#application-id and → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/container#container-id.

If log aggregation *is not* enabled, the log files are retained for ${→ development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-log-retain-seconds} seconds.
-
If log aggregation *is* enabled, they are retained for ${→ development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-nodemanager-delete-debug-delay-sec} seconds

{ Viewing a log file

code {
yarn logs -applicationId application_1466361633780_0001 
code }
This command needs the → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application[application] to be finished and log aggregation to be enabled.

The logs of an → development/Apache/Hadoop/YARN/Application-master[application master] can also be viewed in a browser in the
resource manager UI on `http://${→ development/Apache/Hadoop/configuration-parameters#yarn-resourcemanager-webapp-address}/cluster` (`http://localhost:8088` on a single node "cluster").
