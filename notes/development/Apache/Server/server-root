$ Apache: Server Root
@ server root

The *server root* is a directory under which the Apache executable (`→ development/Apache/Server/httpd`) tries to find files show name is indicated with relative paths (such as for example `conf/`, `logs/`,
or those indicated with `Include` and `LoadModule` directives.

The location of the server root is determined in the following order:
  • The value of the command line option `-C` together with the `ServerRoot` directive.
  • The value of the command line option `-d`
  • The current working directory
  • A → Windows/registry entry (apparently on Windows?) with a binary installation
  • The server root as compiled into the server (by default `/apache`).

As there is always a current working directory, I am not sure how the last two options can ever be considered.
