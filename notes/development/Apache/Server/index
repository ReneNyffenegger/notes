$ Apache Webserver

{ Modular architecture

  The Apache → web/webserver has a modular architecture: its core includes only the most basic functionality. Additional features can then be added with → development/Apache/Server/module[modules].

  { Base modules

     Some modules are by default already added to the core at compile time. These modules can be shown on the command line with the `-l` option of `→ development/Apache/Server/httpd`:

  }
  { Directives related to modules

    A module can be loaded at startup of Apache with the `LoadModule` directive placed into the → development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf[`httpd.conf`] file.

    Another directive related to modules is `IfModule`.

    Apparently, these directives are themselves implented in a (base) module: *mod_so*.

  }
  { Listing loaded modules

    While the `-l` command line option shows base modules, the `-M` option lists the loaded modules:
code {
$ apache/bin/httpd -l
 core_module (static)
 mpm_winnt_module (static)
 http_module (static)
 so_module (static)
 access_compat_module (shared)
 …
code }

  }
