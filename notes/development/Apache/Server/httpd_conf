$ httpd.conf

`httpd.conf` is the (default) name for the configuration file for the → development/Apache/Server. This configuration file contains *directives*.
-
A directive is typically one line, but can be extended over multiple lines with the line continuation character `\` (as last character on the line).

Comments can be placed with the `#` symbol.

When the webserver is started, the default name and location can be overridden with the `-f` option.

When a setting in `httpd.conf` is changed, the web server needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

{ Scope of directives

  By default, a directive controls the behavior of the entire server. However, a directive's scope can be limited in scope with one of the following *sections*:
    • `<Directory>`
    • `<DirectoryMatch>`
    • `<Files>`
    • `<FilesMatch>`
    • `<Location>`
    • `<LocationMatch>`
    • `<VirtualHost>`

  In addition, directives that effect directories (and subdirectories) only can be placed into → development/Apache/Server/htaccess[`.htaccess`] files (if a corresponding `AllowOverride` directive
  allows to override a setting in `.htaccess`).

{ Checking validity of syntax

  The `-t` option of `httpd` allows to check the validity of a configuration file like syntax or if referenced file paths are present on the file system:
code {
$ apache/bin/httpd -t
Syntax OK
code }

  Alternatively, its also possible to check the syntax with `apachectl configtest`.

  Some excerpts from my httpd.conf file that I wish I could remember…

  The `DocumentRoot` can be queried in → development/web/php with → `development/web/php/snippets/_SERVER[$_SERVER]['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`.
