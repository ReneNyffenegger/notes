$ httpd.conf

`httpd.conf` is the (default) name for the configuration file for the → development/Apache/Server. This configuration file contains *directives*.
-
A directive is typically one line, but can be extended over multiple lines with the line continuation character `\` (as last character on the line).

Comments can be placed with the `#` symbol.

When the webserver is started, the default name and location of the `httpd.conf` file can be overridden with the `-f` option.

When a setting in `httpd.conf` is changed, the web server needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

{ ServerRoot

  The `ServerRoot` directive specifies the directory under which the server's configuration, error and log files will be written.
  
  TODO: Does it also specify the directory where `LoadModule` searches for modules?

  With an XAMPP installation, this directive might look like this:
code {
ServerRoot "C:/Users/rene/xampp/apache"
code }

  For example, the location of the error log file (below `ServerRoot`) is controlled with the `ErrorLog` directive:
code {
ErrorLog "logs/error.log"
code }

}
{ Listen

 `Listen` specifies the port which the server will listen for HTTP requests:
code {
Listen 80
code }

}
{ DocumentRoot

 `DocumentRoot` specifies the top directory from where documents are served to the client.
code {
DocumentRoot "C:/Users/rene/web/httpsdocs"
code }

  The `DocumentRoot` directive might go hand in hand with a `<Directory` directive:
code {
<Directory "C:/Users/rene/web/httpsdocs">
    Options       Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Require       all granted
</Directory>
code }

  The value of `DocumentRoot` can be queried in → development/web/php with `→ development/web/php/snippets/_SERVER[$_SERVER]['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`.

}
{ LoadModule / IfModule

 `LoadModule` loads a *Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)*.
code {
LoadModule dir_module modules/mod_dir.so
code }

  Directives that need to be executed only if a module was loaded, can be placed within the `<IfModule …>` directive:
code {
<IfModule dir_module>
    DirectoryIndex index index.php index.html
</IfModule>
code }

  An `<IfModule …>` test can be negated with an exclamation mark:
code {
<IfModule !moduleName>…
code }

  `IfModule …>` tests can be nested.

}
{ Define

  The `Define` directive comes in two forms.
  
  In the first form, `Define` is used boolean. It is equivalent to the `-D …` command line option of `httpd`
code {
Define XYZ
code }

  If `XYZ` was defined can then be tested with the `<IfDefine XYZ> … </IfDefine>` directive.

  The second form allows to associate a symbol with a value:
code {
Define USER "rene"
code }

  The value of `USER` is expanded in `httpd.conf` with `${USER}`.

}
{ Scope of directives

  By default, a directive controls the behavior of the entire server. However, a directive's scope can be limited in scope with one of the following *sections*:
    • `<Directory>`
    • `<DirectoryMatch>`
    • `<Files>`
    • `<FilesMatch>`
    • `<Location>`
    • `<LocationMatch>`
    • `<VirtualHost>`
    • `<IfDefine>` ?


  In addition, directives that effect directories (and subdirectories) only can be placed into → development/Apache/Server/htaccess[`.htaccess`] files (if a corresponding `AllowOverride` directive
  allows to override a setting in `.htaccess`).


}
{ Checking validity of syntax

  The `-t` option of `httpd` allows to check the validity of a configuration file like syntax or if referenced file paths are present on the file system:
code {
$ apache/bin/httpd -t
Syntax OK
code }

  Alternatively, its also possible to check the syntax with `apachectl configtest`.

{ Some excerpts

  Some excerpts from my httpd.conf file that I wish I could remember…

code {
Listen 80

ServerRoot "C:/Users/rene/xampp/apache"
…
DocumentRoot "C:/Users/rene/htdocs"

<Directory "C:/Users/rene/htdocs">

  #    - SymLinksifOwnerMatch
