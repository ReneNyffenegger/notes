  table { ll

    `-d → development/Apache/Server/server-root[serverroot]` ☰ Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to serverroot. This can be overridden by the → development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf#apache-directive-ServerRoot[`ServerRoot`] directive in the → development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf[configuration file]. The default is `→ Linux/fhs/usr/local/apache2`.
    `-f config` ☰ Specifies the → development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf[config file] for starting up Apache Server. If `config` does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to the ServerRoot. The default is `conf/httpd.conf`.
    `-k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop` ☰ Signals httpd to start, restart, or stop. See → https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/stopping.html[Stopping Apache httpd for more information].
    `-C directive` ☰ Process the configuration directive *before* reading config files.
    `-c directive` ☰ Process the configuration directive *after* reading config files.
    `-D parameter` ☰ Sets a configuration parameter which can be used with `<IfDefine>` sections in the configuration files to conditionally skip or process commands at server startup and restart. Also can be used to set certain less-common startup parameters including `-DNO_DETACH` (prevent the parent from forking) and `-DFOREGROUND` (prevent the parent from calling `setsid()` et al).
    `-e level` ☰ Sets the LogLevel to level during server startup. This is useful for temporarily increasing the verbosity of the error messages to find problems during startup.
    `-E file` ☰ Send error messages during server startup to file.
    `-h` ☰ Output a short summary of available command line options.
    `-l` ☰ Output a list of → development/Apache/Server/module[modules] compiled into the server. This will not list dynamically loaded → development/Apache/Server/module[modules] included using the `LoadModule` directive.
    `-L` ☰ Output a list of directives provided by static → development/Apache/Server/module[modules], together with expected arguments and places where the directive is valid. Directives provided by shared modules are not listed.

    `-T` ☰  Skip document root check at startup/restart. (Available in 2.3.8 and later)
    `-t` ☰ Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program immediately exits after these syntax parsing tests with either a return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error). If `-D DUMP_VHOSTS` is also set, details of the virtual host configuration will be printed. If `-D DUMP_MODULES` is set, all loaded modules will be printed.
    `-v` ☰ Print the version of `httpd`, and then exit.
    `-V` ☰ Print the version and build parameters of `httpd`, and then exit.
    `-X` ☰ Run `httpd` in debug mode. Only one worker will be started and the server will not detach from the console.
