$ .htaccess

Create a 301 (Moved Permanetly) redirection. Note: the redirected path seems to be required to be statet absolutely, even if the `.htaccess` files is placed
in the same directory where the redirected ressource is stored.
code {
RewriteEngine On
Redirect 301 /path/to/ressource.html http://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/Apache/Server/htaccess
code }
(See also → development/web/HTML/redirection)

Serve `handler.php` no matter what was requested
code {
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^.* handler.php
code }

If url is a path only, Serve *file.one* if existing else serve *file.two* (if existing):
code {
DirectoryIndex file.one file.two
code }

Force files without suffix to be served as `text/html` files:
code {
<FilesMatch "^[^\.]+$">
  ForceType text/html
</FilesMatch>
code }

Let Apache serve suspicious files with names like → tools/wget, too.
code {
<IfModule mod_security.c>
  SecFilterEngine Off
  SecFilterScanPOST Off
</IfModule>
code }
