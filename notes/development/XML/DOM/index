$ XML DOM

The xML Document Object Model (DOM) provides the functionality to programmtically read, manipulate and modify → development/XML/DOM/nodes/document[XML documents].

The basic differences to the → development/web/HTML DOM are
  • HTML DOM «knows» about the relationship of its → development/web/HTML/tags[elements] (for example → development/web/HTML/tags/tr[`<tr>`] is part of → development/web/HTML/tags/table[`<table>`]
  • HTML DOM is mostly (or at least partially) case insensitive
