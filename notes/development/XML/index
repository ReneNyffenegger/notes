XML is a format to store *hierarchical* data. Thus, the content of an → development/XML/DOM/nodes/document can be (graphically) represented as a tree.

{ Namespace

  Namespaces are used to prevent name collisions in an XML document (for example when using XSLT with an XML document).

  An *XML namespace* consists of a set of names that are all different from one another.
