*XPath* is a → development/standards/W3C recommendation for navigating → development/XML documents.

XPath is a subset of the → development/XML/XQuery language. So, an XPath expression is also an XQuery expression.

{ Some XPath elements

  table { ll

    `/` ☰ represents the root of the → development/XML element tree.
    `/xyz` ☰ navigates to the node named *xyz* immediately below the root of the XML eleent tree.
    `/abc/*/xyz` ☰ navigates to node *xyz* which is below any single node that is below *abc* immediatly under the root element.
    `//N` ☰ navigates to any node *N* below the «actual context»
    `//N//M` ☰ navigates to any node *N* below any node *M* below the «actual context»
    `..` ☰ get «actual node's» parent node
    `@foo` ☰ evaluate to the value of the attribute named `@foo` (For example `//someNode/@theAttribute`)
    `[…]` ☰ apply a filter, on child node value: `//parentNode[childNode = 'xyz']` or on node's attribute: `//node[@attr = 'bla']`). Some operators include `=`, `!=`, `or`, `and`, `not()`
