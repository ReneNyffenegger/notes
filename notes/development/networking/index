{ Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

  Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios operate in the 2.4-GHz frequency range.

  Version 2.0 of the Bluetooth specification supports AFH. With AFH, a Bluetooth radio senses traffic from other types of radios, marks the busy channels as ”noisy,” and avoids those channels as it hops frequencies

  In Windows, AFH is enabled under the registry key `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\BthServ\Parameters` (see → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth-faq[Microsoft's Bluetooth FAQ]).
