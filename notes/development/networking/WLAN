WLAN refers to technologies and protocols that allow digital communication without wire (hence wireless).

  { WPA (Wi-Fi Protected access)

    WPA is a security certification program designed by the Wi-Fi Alliance in response to weaknesses found in the previous system WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy).

    There are three WPA stamdards(?): WPA, WPA2 and WPA3.

   *WPA-PSK* (PSK = pre-shared key) is designed for home, small office and basic uses.
    -
    In contrast, *WPA-Enterprise* (a.k.a. WPA-802.1X or just WPA) is designed for enterprise networks and requires a RADIUS server)

    WPA is sometimes also referred to as *TKIP standard*.
