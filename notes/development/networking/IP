    In Windows, the IP address can be determined with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ipconfig_exe#ipconfig-exe-get-ip-addr[a combination of `ipconfig.exe` and `findstr.exe`].

    The → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] script → development/tools/scripts/personal/ip_ps1[`ip.ps1`] prints IP addresses of local non-loopback adapters.

   Yet, this approach does not seem to work behind → development/networking/NAT.
