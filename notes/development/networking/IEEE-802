$ IEEE 802

IEEE 802 refers to standards dealing with → development/networking/LAN[LANS] and Metropolitan area networks.

{ IEEE 802.11 #ieee-802-11

  Specifications for → development/networking/WLAN[wireless networking] technologies, commonly referred to as WIFI.

  IEEE 802.1X defines *Port-based network access control*.

  In the context of IEEE 802.1X, a *port* is
    • a port of an Ethernet switch, or
    • an IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN access point

  The three main actors in 802.1X are:
  table { ll
    Authenticator ☰ Enforcement of the authentication of a device that wants to access the controlled port.
    Supplicant ☰ Communcating the credentials to the authenticator.
    Authentication Server ☰ Performing authentication by checking the credentials which are forwarded by the authenticator. An authentication server is typically a *RADIUS server* with *Extensible Authentication Protocol* (EAP) support.
  table }

  Two IEEE 802.1X supplicant libraries on Windows are `onex.dll` and `onexui.dll`.

  In Linux, I had some success connecting to a WLAN with
code {
$ ip a   # find interface name (for example: wlp0s20f3)
$ wpa_passphrase THESSID theSecret > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
$ wpa_supplicant -B -D nl80211 -i wlp0s20f3 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
code }

}
