DNS stands for *Domain Name System*.

The goal of DNS was to displace the `HOSTS.TXT` file.

The three main components of DNS are
table { ll
  The *domain name space* and *resource records* ☰ Namespaces organized in a tree fashion. Each namespace stores some data («resource records»).
  Name servers ☰ They hold information about the tree for which they are the *authority* - and optionally(?) the (cached) information of a portion of the rest of the  domain tree's structure.
  Resolvers ☰ Programs that communicate with name servers to extract the information they store.
table }

{ Zones

 *Zones* are units into which *authoritative information* is organized.

  Zones can be distributed to name servers which then provide the data on a redundant basis.

}

{ Entry types

  table { ll
    A ☰ The IP address of the host.
    AAAA ☰ The IPv6 address of the host.
    CNAME ☰ Canonical name. The value of a CNAME record points to a domain, not to an IP address. For example used for `www.abc.xyz` pointing to `abc.xyz` (which then has an A record).
    HINFO ☰ Identifies the CPU and OS used by the host
    MX ☰ The mail exchange for the host. An MX record cannot point to a CNAME record.
    NS ☰ The authoritative name server for the domain. An NS record cannot point to a CNAME record.
    PTR ☰ A pointer to another part in the domain namespace.wj
    SOA ☰ Identifies the start of a zone of authority
    TXT ☰
  table }

}
{ Top level domain arpa

  IPv4: `in-addr.arpa`, IPv6: `ip6.arpa`
