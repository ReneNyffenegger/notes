{ 3463 Enhanced Mail System Status Codes #rfc-3463

? RFC 3463 specifies an *enhanced status code* to consist of a three-part numeric code with a dot as separator between the parts.
  -
? These parts are referred to as
   • Class subcode, which indicates if the delivery attempt was successful (2=sucess, 4=persistent transiert failure or 5=permanent failure)
   • Subject subcode, which indicates the probable source of a delivery anomaly
   • Detail subcode: the prices error condition

  The definition of enhanced status codes seems to have been necessary because → development/web/protocols/SMTP offered only 12 useful codes for delivery.

  These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state
 (called cookies) at → development/web/HTTP/User-Agent[user agents], letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.

  for users to be able to direct their user agent(s) to interact with given sites only over secure connections.

{ 9000 QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport #rfc-9000

  QUIC is a secure general-purpose transport protocol, allegedly more performant than TCP.

? QUIC includes security features so that it does not require other protocols such as TLS.

  QUIC identifies a connection by a unique id, not by IP addresses. Thus, a download can continue
  even when switching between Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

  QUIC is supported by → web/webserver/nginx since version 1.25.0.
