abbr: MIME

{ type and subtype

  A mime type consists of a type and a subtype that are seperated by a slash: `type/subtype`, for example `application/pdf` or `image/jpeg`.

}

{ x-type

  In theory, all mime types are registered with IANA (»Internet Assigned Numbers Authority«). 

  However, some vendors choose to use unofficial types and prepend them with `x-`

}
{ Determining the MIME type string of a file

  The `-i` option of → Linux/shell/commands/file#file-determine-character-encoding [`file`] shows the MIME type string of a file.

}
{ Association between MIME type and application #mime-application-association

  Within the → Linux/X/XDG[XDG] standard, *xdg-utils* can be used to associated MIME types with applications.
