$ web service

Web services allow to
  • query
  • store
  • calculate/manipulate
→ development/Data[data] on a dedicated server.

A web service can be contrasted to *batch processes*.

Features:
  • Standardised by → development/standards/W3C[World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)]
  • Can (theoretically) be implemented in different technologies
  • No definition *how* service looks like, but description posssible with → development/web/service/WSDL/index[WSDL].

One of the most significant characteristic of web services is their *loose coupling*. Each service has its own
  • Server they're running on
  • Programming language
  • Library version.

Web services typically send/return (strucuered) text in a non binary format. A web service usually does not return executable code.
