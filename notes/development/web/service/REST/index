$ Representational state transfer
@ REST


REST tries to fix the problems with → development/web/service/SOAP.

REST uses the standard → development/web/HTTP/request-methods[HTTP request methods] (aka verbs) `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `PATCH` to create, change or delete content (aka CRUD operations).

{ Stateless servers

  A REST server is *stateless*: it does not store any context for a client after having serviced a request.

  Thus, the client stores the *session state* and provides the server all information needed when making a requst.

  A client that has outstanding requests is considered to be in *transition*.

{ TODO

  Is `swagger.json` used to describe a REST API?
  -
  Swagger seems to be related to → https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI].
