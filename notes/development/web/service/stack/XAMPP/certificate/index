$ XAMPP: Create and use certificates

This page hopefully demonstrates how a → development/security/cryptography/public-key/certificate can be added to
→ development/web/service/stack/XAMPP (on → Windows).

First, we need to open a → Windows/PowerShell session and define a couple of variables:
code {
$domain              = 'the-domain.tq84'
$xampp_root          = "$home/xampp"
code }


When I tried to create the certificates, I was struggling with *Invalid self signed SSL cert - "Subject Alternative Name Missing"* errors thrown by Chrome.

This → https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210221/180275[Stackoverflow answer] explained how I could create a «correct» certificate.

First, we need an OpenSSL config file which is created by the following → Windows/PowerShell/language/command:
code {
@"
[ req ]
  default_bits       = 4096
  distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
  req_extensions     = req_ext
  prompt             = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
  commonName         = $domain

[ req_ext ]
  subjectAltName     = DNS:$domain
# subjectAltName     = IP:192.168.0.1

"@ | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/file/out -encoding ascii ssl.conf
code }

A private key is needed:
code {
& $xampp_root\apache\bin\openssl → development/security/cryptography/SSL-TSL/OpenSSL/executable/genrsa     -out private-key.pem
code }


We also need a *Client Server Request* (CSR) …
code {
& $xampp_root\apache\bin\openssl → development/security/cryptography/SSL-TSL/OpenSSL/executable/req   -new -key private-key.pem -out server.csr -config ssl.conf
code }

… with which the certificate can be created:
code {
& $xampp_root\apache\bin\openssl → development/security/cryptography/SSL-TSL/OpenSSL/executable/x509  -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey private-key.pem -out server.crt -extensions req_ext -extfile ssl.conf
code }

The CSR itself is not actually needed:
code {
rm server.csr
code }

We copy the private key and the certificate to the `apache/conf` directory:
code {
cp private-key.pem $xampp_root\apache\conf
cp server.crt      $xampp_root\apache\conf
code }

The certificate needs also to be installed into *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* (here for the current user):
code {
import-certificate -filePath server.crt -certStoreLocation cert:\currentUser\Root
code }

It would also be possible to install it for all users on the local machine:
code {
# import-certificate -filePath server.crt -certStoreLocation cert:\localMachine\Root
code }

The «domain» is added `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` so that the web browser can resolve it to an IP address:
code {
127.0.0.1            the-domain.tq84
code }

Finally, the «virtual host» is added to the Apache configuration (typically in → development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts_conf[`$xampp_root/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`]):
code {
<VirtualHost the-domain.tq84:443>
     ServerAdmin           bla@the-domain.tq84
     DocumentRoot          "C:/users/rene/XAMPP/htdocs"
     ServerName             the-domain.tq84
     ServerAlias          *.the-domain.tq84
     ErrorLog              "logs/the-domain.tq84.log" 
     CustomLog             "logs/the-domain.tq84.log" common
     SSLEngine on
     SSLCertificateFile    "conf/server.crt"
     SSLCertificateKeyFile "conf/private-key.pem"
</VirtualHost>
code }
