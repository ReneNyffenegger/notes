{ Installing XAMPP #xampp-install

  XAMPP can be installed from an → development/archive-files[archive file] and requires little configuration.

  { Chocolatey

    Alternatively, XAMPP can also be installed with → Windows/Chocolatey:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco_exe[choco] install -y bitnami-xampp
code }

    When trying to install XAMPP with Chocolatey, some user interaction is still required to let *Windows Defender Firewall* unblock some ports.

    I am not sure if or how `choco` can be invoked so that this manual intervention is not necessary.

    The installation root is `C:\xampp`. (So, for example, the → development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf[`httpd.conf`] file is found
    under `C:\xampp\apache\conf`.
