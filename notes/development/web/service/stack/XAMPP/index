  table { ll

    X ☰ Cross platform (as opposed to limiting it to L = → Linux or W = → Windows in LAMP/WAMP)
    A ☰ → development/Apache/Server[Apache (webserver)]
    M ☰ → development/databases/MariaDB (which replaced → development/databases/MySQL in the year 2015)
    P ☰ → development/web/php
    P ☰ → development/languages/Perl

  table }

  Although the acronym explicitly references MariaDB, it also comes with → development/databases/SQLite.

{ Installing XAMPP #xampp-install

  XAMPP can be downloaded as an → development/archive-files[archive file] from → https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/ and then
  be installed with little configuration.

  After extracting the archive, → development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/setup_xampp_bat[`.\setup_xampp.bat`] must be executed.

  { Chocolatey

    Alternatively, XAMPP can also be installed with → Windows/Chocolatey:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco_exe[choco] install -y bitnami-xampp
code }

    When trying to install XAMPP with Chocolatey, some user interaction is still required to let *Windows Defender Firewall* unblock some ports.
    gh|about-XAMPP|/install/img/Windows-Defender-Firewall.png||

    I am not sure if or how `choco` can be invoked so that this manual intervention is not necessary.

    The installation root is `C:\xampp`. (So, for example, the → development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf[`httpd.conf`] file is found
    under `C:\xampp\apache\conf`).

  }

{ Directory structure

  Some interesting files and directories found under XAMPP's installation root seem to be:
