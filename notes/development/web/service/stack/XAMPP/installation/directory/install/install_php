$ XAMPP installation directory: install/install.php

`install/install.php` is invoked from → development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/setup_xampp_bat[`setup_xampp.bat`]

As far as I can see, this script changes all paths in configuration and `.*bat` files so that they point to the correct location in the installtion directory.

sa:
  → development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/htdocs/xampp/_version[`htdocs/xampp/.version`]
