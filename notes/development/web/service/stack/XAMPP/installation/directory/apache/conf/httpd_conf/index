  Some `Include` directives…

  Settings specific to XAMPP:
code {
Include "→ development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/apache/conf/extra/httpd-xampp_conf[conf/extra/httpd-xampp.conf]"
code }

→ development/security/cryptography/SSL-TLS[SSL] is enabled with the include directive
code {
Include "→ development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/apache/conf/extra/httpd-ssl_conf[conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf]"

}
