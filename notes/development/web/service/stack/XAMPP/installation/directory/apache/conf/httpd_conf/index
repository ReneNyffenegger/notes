$ XAMPP installation directory: apache/conf/httpd.conf

XAMPP's `apache/conf/httpd.conf` file seems to be mostly a rather standard `→ development/Apache/Server/httpd_conf` file with the following `Include` directives:
code {
Include "→ development/web/service/stack/XAMPP/installation/directory/apache/conf/extra/httpd-xampp_conf[conf/extra/httpd-xampp.conf]"
code }
