$ WebGL: Clip space

The *clip space* is a cube within which coordinates must be positioned in order to be rendered.

Each coordinate runs from -1 to 1:
  • x: left to right
  • y: bottom to top
  • z: front to back

The following simple program draws a single triangly, hopefully demonstrating the effect of the x and y coordinates. The value of the z-coordinate, as long as it is between -1 and 1, has no visible effect because
it goes from front to back:
