$ OpenGL ES Shading Language

It seems that the «ES» stands for *Embedded Subset*.
-
Apparently, the OpenGL ES Shading Language is a (strict?) subset of the OpenGL Shading Language.


{ int vs float

  `42` is an integer, not a float. The following assignment produces the error *Cannot convert from `const int` to `highp float`*.
code {
float num = 42;
code }

  Thus, in order to assign a number to a float, it must be made sure that a float is assigned:
code {
float num = 42.0;
code }

}
{ Constants

code {
const float PI = radians(180.0);
code }

}
