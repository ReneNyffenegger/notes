$ HTTP Header: Content-Type
@ Content-Type

The → development/web/HTTP/header `Content-Type` transmits (among others?) a → development/web/Multipurpose-Internet-Mail-Extensions type.

Often, `Content-Type` has a value like
  • `text/html; charset=utf-8`,
  • `multipart/form-data; boundary=MYCAREFULLYCHOSENBOUNDARY` or
  • `text/plain`.
But I have also seen (in an → development/Data/OData environment):
code {
application/json; odata.metadata=minimal; odata.streaming=true
code }

In POST requests, I have seen:
  • `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8`

sa:

  The response header `X-Content-Type-Options` header`.

  Compare also with `Accept-Charset`
