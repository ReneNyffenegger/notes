$ HTTP request methods

→ development/web/RFC#rfc-7231[RFC 7231] describes the following (standardized) → development/web/HTTP request methods:
table { ll
  `GET` ☰  *Get* the current representation of the target resource. («download»)
  `HEAD` ☰ Same as `GET` but transfer status line and → development/web/HTTP/header[headers] only.
  `POST` ☰ Resource specific processing. A typical use case for `POST` is to transfer data (such as entered into → development/web/HTML/tags/form[`<form>`] tag) to the → web/webserver[web server] («upload some data for processing»)
  `PUT` ☰ Replace target or create new target with sent representation of resource («upload new resource»)
  `DELETE` ☰ Remove target
  `CONNECT` ☰ Create a tunnel
  `OPTIONS` ☰ Describe communication options for the target resource
  `TRACE` ☰ message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
table }


`GET` and `HEAD` are required by a *general-purpose* web server, the other methods are optional.

{ Safe and idempotent methods

  A method is → https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#rfc.section.9.2.1[safe] if it doesn't alter the state of the server (i. e. are «read-only»):
    • `GET`
    • `HEAD`
    • `OPTIONS`
    • `TRACE`

  → https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#rfc.section.9.2.2[Idempotent methods] are methods whose result is the same regardless of the number of times it is executed.
  -
  These mthods include all safe methods and additionally add:
    • `PUT`
    • `DELETE`

}
{ Difference between PUT and POST

  `PUT` modifies a resource on the web server. Typically, → development/Data is sent with a `PUT` request that defines the content of the resource.

   A `POST` does not modify such a resource, but rather uploads data for being processed by the web server.

   A `POST` is sometimes used to create new resource, yet with a different URL than being used in the request.
   -
   In such scenarios, a `PUT` might be considered analogous to an SQL `update` statement and a `POST` to an → development/databases/SQL/DML/insert[`insert`] statement.
   
   If a new resource was created, the answer's  → development/web/HTTP/status-code[status code] typically is `201 Created`.

}
{ Status codes

  The → development/web/HTTP/status-code 501 (Not Implemented) indicates that the server either does not recognize or has no implementation for the specific method.

  405 (Method not allowed) indicates that the method is recognized and implemented, but not allowed for the requested resource.

}
sa:

  The `method` → development/web/HTML/tags/form#thml-form-attributes[attribute] of the → development/web/HTML/tags/form[HTML `<form>` element] can be set to `GET` or `POST` and corresponds to the respective request method.

  Command line executable → tools/cURL[`curl`]:
    • `-X` specifies the HTTP request method
    • A `PUT` request is specified with → tools/cURL#curl-T[`-T` (`--upload-file`)]

  In → development/web/php, the request method can be queried with `→ development/web/php/snippets/_SERVER[$_SERVER]['REQUEST_METHOD']`.
