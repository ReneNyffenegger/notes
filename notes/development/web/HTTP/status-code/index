$ HTTP status codes
@ status code

A HTTP status code is a three digit number. It is sent in the first response line (also referred to as *status line*) after a HTTP request.

A status code informs the → development/web/HTTP/User-Agent if and how the → web/webserver[web server] was able to understand and satisfy the corresponding request.

Some HTTP status codes include:
