{ Initial goals and history

  The HTTP protocol was initialize developed to create the network service that allow documents link with each other. This linking feature was referred to
  as *hypertext*. (The initial letters HT in both, HTTP and → development/web/HTML stands for *Hyper Text*.)

  Over time, the standard has evolved to adadpt and satisfy the needs of a truly *World Wide Web* so that in the age of YouTube and other non-textual services, the aspect of *HyperText* has become
  less important than in the origins of HTTP.

}
{ Client-Server Architecture

  HTTP has a classical *Client-Server Architecture* at its core.

  The *HTTP Server* has a set of *resources* (such as → development/web/HTML documents etc) that it serves when requested by a *HTTP Client*.

  These resources are identified by an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#uri[URI] (Uniform Resource Identifier).

  In order to obtain such a resource, the client initiates a → development/web/TCP-IP[TCP] (HTTP 3: UDP?) connection to the server. After establishing such a connection,
  the client sends a request → development/web/HTTP/header that contains the URI of the desired resource.

  The server answers the request by sending a request header followed by the resource body.

  A particular feature of the request/response → development/web/HTTP/header[headers] is that they are exchanged in (mostly) human readable text.

  A HTTP client is also referred to as → development/web/HTTP/User-Agent[user agent], a HTTP server as a → web/webserver[web server].


}
{ Possible Request-Response exchange

  The following two headers try to give an idea how a HTTP request-response exchange might be executed.

  { Request

    The → development/web/HTTP/User-Agent[user agent] requests a resource by sending a HTTP request to a → web/webserver[web server]. The desired
    URI is *http://rene.nyffenegger.ch/notes/development/web/HTTP*

    So the client contacts the the server (renenyffenegger.ch) and sends a header that might look like.
code {
GET /notes/development/web/HTTP/header HTTP/1.1
host: renenyffenegger.ch
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
accept-language: de
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
referer: www.google.com
accept-charset: *
x-forwarded-for: …
x-forwarded-host: …
x-forwarded-server: …
connection: close
code }

    In the request header, the first line is the *request line* that specifies the *request method* (in this example `GET`), the URI and the protocol Version (`HTTP/1.1`).

    The request line is followed by *header fields*, each of which has a name that is separated from its value by a colon (`:`).

    The header extends to the first empty line.

  }
  { Response

    The web server returns the requested resource along with a header.

    The body of the resource is separated from the header by an empty line.

    The first line of the response is a *status line* that consists of
      • HTTP Version (Format: `HTTP M/m`, M = Major number, m = minor number)
      • A three-digit → development/web/HTTP/status-code
      • A character string that describes the status code

  A potential response header from a → web/webserver might be:
code {
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Wed, 4 Mar 2020 21:18:13 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: …

<html>
  …
</htm>
code }

  }

}
{ Proxies

  At times, there is a need for a user agent to request the desired resources indirectly, using a proxy.

  Such a proxy is contacted by the user agent and forwards the user agent's request to the web server, thus acting on behalf of the user agent.
  
  The web server sends its responses also to the proxy which then relays them to the user agent.

  A proxy minimally changes some portions of the exchanged messages, usually in their headers.
  -
 (A proxy that does not change the messages is referred to as *tunnel*).

  A special kind of proxy is the so called *captive portal* (aka interception proxy or transparent proxy) because a captive portal is not actively chosen by the user agent.

}
{ HTTP/2


  HTTP/2 allows
    • a more efficient use of network resources and
    • a reduced perception of latency.

  This is achieved
    • by introducing header field compression and
    • allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.

  In addition, HTTP/2 introduces *unsolicited* push of representations from servers to clients.

  HTTP/2 does not obsolete HTTP/1.1


  HTTP/2 is described in → development/web/RFC#rfc-7540[RFC 7540]

}
{ HTTP/3

  HTTP/3 is the proposed successor of HTTP/2.

  HTTP/3 uses UDP rather than → development/web/TCP-IP[TCP] for communication.

}
{ TODO

  HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) apparently specifies that a browser may only connect to a server securely.
  -
  So, exceptions can not be added.

}
{ Misc

  Development of the HTTP protocoll was initiated by → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee[Tim Berners-Lee].
