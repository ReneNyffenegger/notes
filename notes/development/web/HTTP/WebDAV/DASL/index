$ DASL

DASL consists of
  • the `SEARCH` → development/web/HTTP/request-methods[method] and the request/response formats defined for it
  • feature discovery through the "DASL" response header and the optional DAV:supported-grammar-set property
  • optional grammar schema discovery, and
  • one mandatory grammar (DAV:basicsearch)

{ Basic steps when using DASL

  The basic usage of DASL is
    • The client formulates a query using the *DAV:basicsearch* grammar
    • The client passes the query (`text/xml` or `application/xml`) to the server («search arbiter») using the `SEARCH` method.
    • The search arbiter executes the query
    • The search abiter sends the response back using an entity that matches the *WebDAV multistatus format* (→ development/web/HTTP/status-code[Status code] 207, RFC-4918, Section 13)

}

  DASL relies on the resource and property model which is defined in RFC-4918.

  Apparently, DASL is used in → Microsoft/Office/Outlook/Object-Model[Outlook's objec model] method
  → Microsoft/Office/Outlook/Object-Model/Application/advancedSearch[`application.advancedSearch`].
