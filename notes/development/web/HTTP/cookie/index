$ HTTP Cookie

A cookie is a piece of information (a name/value pair) that a → development/web/browser[web browser] stores on behalf of a visited site.
-
This information might be something like site preferences or login status.
-
When the site is visited again, the information is returned to the site.

In → development/web/browser/Firefox, cookies are stored in the → development/web/browser/Firefox/profile-folder[profile folder] under
→ development/web/browser/Firefox/profile-folder/cookies_sqlite.

Cookies allow a → web/webserver[web server] to maintain state over the basically stateless → development/web/HTTP protocoll.

{ Scope of cookies

  A cookie has an associated scope which defines:
    • the maximum amount of time in which the user agent should return the cookie,
    • the servers to which the user agent should return the cookie, and
    • the URI schemes for which the cookie is applicable.

}
{ Security concerns

  For historical reasons, there are a few security concerns with cookies:
    • Although a server can indicate that a given cookie is intended for «secure» connections (with the `Secure` attribute?), it does not provide integrity in the presence of an active network attacker
    • Cookies for a given host are shared across all the ports on that host, even though the usual *same-origin policy* used by web browsers isolates content retrieved via different ports.

}

{ Netscape cookies?

  It seems there cookies following the «→ http://web.archive.org/web/20020803110822/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html[netscape cookie protocol]» and cookies following the protocol defined in → development/web/RFC#rfc-2965[RFC 2965].

  → https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookiejar.html[Allegedly], the great majority of cookies on the internet are Netscape cookies.
  -
  The Netscape cookie protocol differs substantially from that set out in the original Netscape specification.

sa:

  Cookies are defined in → development/web/RFC#rfc-6265[RFC 6265] (HTTP State Management Mechanism), but see also the obsolete RFCs  → development/web/RFC#rfc-2109[2109] and → development/web/RFC#rfc-2965[2965].

  The `Set-Cookie` HTTP request → development/web/HTTP/header[header] and the associated → development/web/HTTP/header#http-respsonse-header[`Cookie` response header].

  In → development/web/browser/Chrome, the cookies for the individual sites can be inspected with the special URL `chrome://settings/siteData/`.

  → development/web/php allows store valaues for → development/web/php/snippets/session[sessions].
