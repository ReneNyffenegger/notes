{ URI: Uniform Resource Identifier #uri

   A URI identifies a *resource* by a sequence of characters. An URI is *not* a file name, although in most cases that seems to be the case.
   For example, because of *content negotiation*, the same URI can lead to (different) documents in different languages.

   → development/web/RFC/index#rfc-3986[RFC 3986] requires the URI (that is: its sequence of characters) to be chosen from a limited subset of the repertoire of US-ASCII characters.

   There are two types of URIs: URLs and URNs

  URNs define XML schemas:
code {
urn:<namespace>:<string>
code }

{ IRI Internationalized Resource Identifier #iri
 
 An IRI is a string that conforms to → development/web/RFC#rfc-3987[RFC 3987]. It »improves« URIs in that it not only allows for ASCII characters, but also for entire
 UCS-based character set.

{ URC: Uniform Resource Citation

  URCs provide a set of attribute/value pairs that describe properties of URIs like authorship, publisher, copyright etc.
