$ CSS: content property
@ content

{ Add text before and/or after an element

  The `content` property allows to add text before and/or after an element using the pseudo selectors `::before` and `::after`:

  In the following example, elements that have a style named 
  gh|about-css|/properties/content/before-after.html||

  gh|about-css|/properties/content/img/before-after.png||

}
{ Add more dynamic text with attr()

  When using `content`, the `attr(xyz)` directive allows to insert the value of the matched element's attribute `xyz`.

  In the following example, the → development/web/HTML/tags/div[divs] with the `num` class have an attribute `data-translation` which is used in the `content` property to insert the
  translation after an element.

  The example also demonstrates that it is possible to concatenate text: the translation is embedded in parantheses:
  gh|about-css|/properties/content/attr.html||

  gh|about-css|/properties/content/img/attr.png||
}
