$ CSS: display: flex
@ flex

{ Sentence and word numbers #css-flex-numbered

  The following example uses the → development/web/CSS/properties/display[display's] `flex` value and the `→ development/web/CSS/properties/float` property to
  enumerate sentences and their words:

  gh|about-css|/properties/display/flex/img/sentence-and-word-numbers.png||

  gh|about-css|/properties/display/flex/sentence-and-word-numbers.html||

}
