$ CSS: overflow
@ overflow

The `overflow`, `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` properties control what happens if an element's content does not fit within the boundaries of the element.

The property can assume one of the following values:
table { ll
  `visible` ☰ The content spills outside its element. This is the default value.
  `hidden`  ☰ The content that does not fit inside the element is not shown at all and remains invisible.
  `auto`    ☰ If the content becomes too large, scroll bars are shown that allow to move the visible content.
  `scroll`  ☰ The scroll bars are always present, regardless of the size of the content.
  `initial` ☰ 
  `inherit` ☰
table }
