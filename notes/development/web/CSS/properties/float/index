$ CSS: float property
@ float

The value of the `float` → development/web/CSS/properties[property] can be set to one of the following values:
table { ll
  `none` ☰ 
  `left` or `right` ☰
  `inline-start` or `inline-end` ☰ The element floats on the start/end side of the containing block. Which side is considered the start/end side is determined with left-to-right or right-to-left «semantics».
table }

The value of `float` has no effect if the value of `→ development/web/CSS/properties/display` is `none`.

An element whose computed value of the the `float` property is different from `none` is referred to as *floating element*.

{ Example: sidebar

  The following example demonstrates how `float: right` can be used to create a *sidebar* in a HTML document:
  gh|about-css|/properties/float/img/sidebar.png||

  { Source code (HTML)

    gh|about-css|/properties/float/sidebar.html||

  }

}
