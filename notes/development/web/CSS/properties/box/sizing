$ CSS property: box-sizing
@ box-sizing

`box-sizing` can be set to one of the following two values:
table { ll
   `content-box` ☰ `width` and `height` control the size of the *content box* (thus the entire size of a box with border and padding will be larger). This is the default for most elements.
