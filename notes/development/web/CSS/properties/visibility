$ CSS: visibility property
@ visibility

The `visibility` property controls where an element is visible or not.

When the value is set to `hidden`, the *content* of the element is not displayed *but* the element still takes as much space as it
would if it were displayed.
-
In order to hide *and* free the occupied space of the element, the → development/web/CSS/properties/display[`display`] property must be set to `none`.
(See → development/web/CSS/properties/display#display-none-vs-visibility-hidden.)
