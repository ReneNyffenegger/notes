$ CSS property: border-collapse

The → development/web/CSS/properties[CSS property] `border-collapse` controls whether cells (`<td>` elements?) inside a → development/web/HTML/tags/table[`<table>`] share their borders with the adjacent cell or if the borders
are drawn separately.

The value of `border-collapse` can be set to one of the following two values or one of the global values:
table { ll
  `collapse` ☰ Borders are shared.
  `separate` ☰ Adjacent cells have distinct borders.
table }


{ Demonstration

  The following example tries to demonstrate the difference between setting `border-collapse` to `collapse` and `separate`:

  gh|about-css|/properties/border/img/collapse.png||

  { Source code (collapse.html)

    gh|about-css|/properties/border/collapse.html||

  }
}

sa:

  `border-collapse` must be set to `separate` in order for → development/web/CSS/properties/border/spacing[`border-spacing`] to take effect.

  CSS properties → development/web/CSS/properties/border[related to borders].
