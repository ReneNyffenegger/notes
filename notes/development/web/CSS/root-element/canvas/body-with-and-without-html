$ CSS: Root element/canvas - Styles for body with and without styles for html element

{ body-with-html.html

  This document specifies a background color for both the → development/web/HTML/tags/html[`<html>`] *and* the → development/web/HTML/tags/body[`<body>`] tag. The background color for the body is only used where the canvas
  is occupied:
  gh|about-CSS|/root-element/canvas/body-with-and-without-html/body-with-html.html||

}
{ body-without-html.html

  In contrast, this document specifies a background color only for the → development/web/HTML/tags/body[`<body>`] element.
  -
  In this case, the body's background color is used to paint the entire canvas:
  gh|about-CSS|/root-element/canvas/body-with-and-without-html/body-without-html.html||

}
