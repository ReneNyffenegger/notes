$ CSS: Experiment with the HTML and BODY tag

I was surprised that the → development/web/HTML/tags/html[`<html>`] tag can be styled in with → development/web/CSS, although all rendered content is
placed as direct or indirect child of the → development/web/HTML/tags/body[`<body>`] tag.

The following example tries to demonstrate two findigs of the experiments I conducted with these two tags. The following is a simple
→ development/web/HTML:
gh|about-CSS|/tags/html-and-body.html||

In a → development/web/browser[browser], it might be rendared like so:
gh|about-CSS|/tags/img/html-and-body.png||

Two obersvetations are, imho, noteworthy.
• Although the `<html>` tag is limited in size (`height` attribute and red border around the `html` area), the value of its `background-color` attribute controls the entire browser viewport.
• Similarly, the scroll bars are not attached immeditatly to the right of the `html` area, but to the borders of the browser window.
