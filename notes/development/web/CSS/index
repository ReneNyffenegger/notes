{ Rulesets, selectors, declarations, properties and property values

  { Declaration

    A *declaration* consists of a → development/web/CSS/properties[property (name)] and the assigned *property value*.

    The property value follows the property name and is separated by a colon from it:
code {
→ development/web/CSS/properties/position: absolute
code }

    Multiple declarations are separated by a semicolon (`;`) from each other:
code {
→ development/web/CSS/properties/position: absolute; → development/web/CSS/properties/font-family: monospace; …
code }

  }
  { Selector

    A → development/web/CSS/selectors[selector] selects the
    → development/web/HTML/tags[(HTML) elements] for which a list of declarations applies.

    The list of declarations is embedded in curly braces.

    So called pseudo selectors (such as `::first-letter`) allow to select portions of the document that don't correspond to an element.

  }
  { Ruleset

    A *ruleset* assigns a list of declarations to a selector.

    The following snippet shows a *ruleset*.
    -
   `div` is the selector.
    -
    The text between `{` and `}` are the declarations:
code {
→ development/web/HTML/tags/div {
   → development/web/CSS/properties/position   : absolute;
   → development/web/CSS/properties/font-family: monospace;
   …
}
code }

    Sometimes, a *ruleset* is referred to simply as a *rule*.

  }


}
{ Rendering content

  CSS is a language that allows to specify how structured document (→ development/web/HTML elements in a → development/web/DOM[DOM]) should be rendered on various output devices such
  as screen, print etc.

  The rendering takes place on a structure that is referred to as *canvas*. This canvas not limited by any bounderies in any direction, so its size is infinite.
  -
  However, the visible part of the canvas might be limited by the *viewport* which is the window that the browser (UA) offers to look upon the canvas. Usually, if the viewport
  is smaller than the size required by elements on the canvas, the viewport is decorated with scrollbars that allow to move the canvas in order to see different parts.
  -
  However, elements whose → development/web/CSS/properties/position[`position`] attribute is set to `fixed` are fixed in respect to the viewport. So, they stay at the same place if
  the scroll bars are used to move the canvas.

}
{ Specification

  The CSS specification is maintained by the → development/standards/W3C.

}
{ CSS Level 1, 2, 3, …

  CSS Level 1 was the first published CSS specification (December 1996).
  -
  This Level is considered obsolete.

  CSS Level 2 (published May 1998) is a revision of CSS Level 1 that addressed issues that were not covered in CSS Level 1

  Both, CSS Level 1 and Level 2, fit into a single document.

  Because of its many problems, the errata list of CSS Level 2 was not updated any further, instead, CSS2.1 was started working on.

  For Level 3 and beyond, it was decided to publish the standard in multiple modules to make the entire process more manageable.
  -
  There is no CSS Level 3 or even CSS Level 4, rather, each module goes through Levels.

  { At-rules

    Some @-rules are
    table { ll
      `@charset` ☰ Specifies the → development/Unicode/character-encoding for the style sheet and is especially useful when using non-→ development/Unicode/ASCII characters in → development/web/CSS/properties[properties] like `→ development/web/CSS/properties/content`. If used, it must be the first element in a style sheet.
      `@color-profile` ☰ Defines a color profile which can then be referred to using the `color()` function.
      `@container` ☰ Apply styles to certain containers: `@container (width > 768px) { → development/web/CSS/properties/font/size: … }`
      `@counter-style` ☰ See also → development/web/HTML/tags/ul-ol-li[`<li>`] elements and the → development/web/CSS/properties/list-style[`list-style-*`] properties.
      `@document` ☰ *Deprecated*
      `@font-face` ☰ Specifies a custom → design/font
      `@font-feature-values` ☰
      `@import` ☰ Imports style rules from other stylesheets. Must be specified as the first at-rule after the optional `@charset` rule. Note that `@import url("path/to.css")` → https://stackoverflow.com/a/24579614/180275[is equivalent] to `@import "path/to.css"`.
      `@keyframes` ☰ Allows to control a transition sequence more precisely than using the → development/web/CSS/properties/transition[`transition-*`] properties.
      `@layer` ☰ Defines a cascade layer.
      `@media` ☰ Apply portions a style sheet based on the result of (one or more) *media queries*. In → development/languages/JavaScript, the rules that were created with `@media` can be accessed with the `CSSMediaRule` interface.
      `@namespace` ☰ Defines → development/XML namespaces for a style sheet.
      `@page` ☰ Modifies properties of a *printed page*
      `@property` ☰ An *experimental* at-rule which allows to define  custome CSS properties. `@property` is part of the CSS Houdini umbrella of APIs.
      `@supports` ☰ Uses a *feature query* so that certain CSS declarations are only applied if a → development/web/browser[browser] supports a given set of CSS features.

  { Staring a CSS

    Is it good practice to start a CSS with something like
code {
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin:  0;
    padding: 0;
}
code }

  }
