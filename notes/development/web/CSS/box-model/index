$ CSS: Box model

The element's content has a padding (potentially of zero size) around it.
-
The padding has (an optional) border around it.
-
Such a box (Element + padding + border) is separated from the boxes around it by a margin.


Box width: left margin + right margin + left border + right border + left padding + right padding + content width.
-
Box height = top margin + bottom margin + top border + bottom border + top padding + bottom padding + content width.

{ Colors

  The margin is always transparent. Content and padding use the `background` property of the generating element.

  The border color is defined by the `border` properties of the generating element.
