$ CSS: creating responsive tables

The following html example tries to demonstrate how CSS can be combined with the → development/web/HTML/tags/table[`<table>` tag] in order to create a → development/web/HTML/Responsive-design[responsive] table.

gh|about-css|/tables/responsive.html||

{ Rendering on a wide screen

  If the screen is wide enough, each record (`<tr>`) of the table is shown in *one* horizontal line:
  gh|about-css|/tables/img/responsive-wide.png||

}
{ Rendering on a narrower screen

  If the screen becomes too narrow to accomodate for the entire row, the cells of the rows are placed vertically, as shown in the following image:
  gh|about-css|/tables/img/responsive-narrow.png||

}
sa:
  → development/web/CSS
