$ CSS positioning: center an element horizontally

The following example tries to demonstrate how an element can be centered horizontally (but not vertically).
It boils down to:
  • Setting the → development/web/CSS/properties/display[`display`] property of the element that should be centered to `block`
  • Having the element's → development/web/CSS/properties/margin[`margin`] property equalt to `0 auto`
