$ CSS / Javascript: center the center of an image on the center of the browsers viewport

This is an experiment that tried to center the center of an image on the center of a → development/web/browser[browser's] viewport.

The dimension of the image is not too large: 600 pixels by 300 pixels. It consists of a blue border at the image's edges and two red lines that indicate the location of the center of the image.

{ Browser viewport smaller than image

  The following image shows how the image is rendered if it is smaller than the viewport:

  In the center of the viewport is the center of the image. Even if the content is scrolled down, the center
  of the image remains centered.

}
{ Viewport larger than image

  The next image shows the result when the browser is resized so that the viewport is larger than the image. Still, the image is centered in the viewport:

}
{ The HTML document

  The HTML document that was used for this experiment is shown below.

  { Some remarks:
  
    The CSS property → development/web/CSS/properties/position[`position`] is set to `fixed`, so that it doesn't scroll if the browser's content is scrlled

    A (→ development/languages/JavaScript event handler (`function resized()`) is programmed that is called when the browser is resized. This event handler calbulates the
    new left and top coordinates of the image.

    The event handler needs to determine the size of the view port. This is possible with the values of
    → development/web/browser/object-model/window/innerWidth-innerHeight[`window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight`] (See → development/web/js-html/coordinates).
