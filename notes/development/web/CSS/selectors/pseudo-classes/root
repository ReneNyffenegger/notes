$ CSS pseudo class selector :root
@ :root

The `:root` pseudo class selector matches a document tree's *root element* which is the `→ development/web/HTML/tags/html` element in HTML documents.

Because the `:root` pseudo class selector has higher specifity than the `html` element, the text of *Not within div* is red rather than blue in the following example.
