$ CSS selectors: children and descendants

`p > c` matches element `c` if `c` is a *direct* descendant (a child) of `p`.

`p d` matches element `d` if `d` is a direct or indirect descendant (a child or grand-child, or grand-grand-grand-child …)  of `p`.

The following HTML document tries to demonstrate these selectors:
