$ FTP

FTP stands for *File Transfer Protocol*.

{ command line #ftp-command-line


  { Interactive mode

    With `mput` or `mget` multiple files can be sent using the star (`*`) on file names.

    If ftp is in interactive mode, however, each file must be confirmed:
code {
ftp> mput foo*.txt
mput foo-001.txt?
code }

   This can be turned of by going into non interactive mode. If it is using interactive mode or not can be queried with `prompt`:

code {
ftp> prompt
Interactive mode off.
ftp> mput foo*.txt
local: foo-001 remote: foo-001.txt
…
code }

    Alternatively, ftp can be started with the `-i` command line flag to turn of interactive prompting.

{ Active vs passive mode #ftp-active-passive-mode

  A FTP session consists of two → development/web/TCP-IP connections, a *data* and a *command* connection.

  In both, active and passive mode, the command connection is initiated by the client.
  -
  With active mode, the data connection is initiated from the server to the client, with passive mode, the client not only starts the command connection, but also the data connection.

  When the client is behind a firewall or the router is performing network address translation (NAT), passive mode should (must?) be used.

  { quote pasv

    In a ftp session, passive mode can be entered with a `quote` command.
code {
ftp> quote pasv
code }

   According to → https://stackoverflow.com/a/28833096/180275[this] and
   → https://stackoverflow.com/a/59805900/180275[this] Stackoverflow answers, `quote pasv` does not cause → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ftp_exe[`ftp.exe`] to enter passive mode *if*
   the value of `Use PASV` under the → Windows/registry key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/FTP[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\FTP`] is set to `yes`.

{ TODO

  Apparently, there is SFTP and FTPS (which are not the same thing).
