abbr: File Transfer Protocol

{ command line #ftp-command-line


  { Interactive mode

    With `mput` or `mget` multiple files can be sent using the star (`*`) on file names.

    If ftp is in interactive mode, however, each file must be confirmed:
code {
ftp> mput foo*.txt
mput foo-001.txt?
code }

   This can be turned of by going into non interactive mode. If it is using interactive mode or not can be queried with `prompt`:

code {
ftp> prompt
Interactive mode off.
ftp> mput foo*.txt
local: foo-001 remote: foo-001.txt
…
code }

    Alternatively, ftp can be started with the `-i` command line flag to turn of interactive prompting.
