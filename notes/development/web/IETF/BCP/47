$ BCP-47

BCP-47 is the → development/web/IETF/BCP[Best Current Practices] for *language tags*. Such tags allow to identify spoken and written languages.

Basic structure of language tags:
  • → development/Unicode/ASCII subtags
  • Up to eight characters long (?)
  • Separated by hyphens
  • Case-independent (`zh` = `ZH` = `Zh` = `zH`)

The hyphens separate each element from one another. The first element is required, up to three additional elements are optional.

These elements are:
  • Language
  • Script
  • Region
  • Variant

Some examples of language tags are:
  • `en-US` (English, United States)
  • `de-DE` (German, Germany)
  • `de-CH` (German, Switzerland)
  • `it-CH` (Italian, Switzerland)
  • `zh-Hant` (Chinese, traditional script)
  • `zh-Hans` (Chinese, simplified script)
  • `zh-Hans-HK` (Chinese, simplified script, Hong Kong)

A language might be tagged `und` (undetermined?), for example `und-Latn`. This matches *any* language that uses *Latin script*.
