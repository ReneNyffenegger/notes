$ HTML element: script
@ script

The `<script>` tag is intended to include script and data blocks into a HTML documnet, *not* to store content which is (directly) rendered for the user.

{ Attributes

  Attributes that are relevant to the `<script>` element are
    • src
    • type
    • nomodule
    • async
    • defer
    • crossorigin
    • integrity
    • referrerpolicy

  { src

    In order to load an → development/languages/JavaScript/inline-vs-external[external JavaScript resource], the `src` attribute must be set to the
    → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] where that resource is located.

  }
  { type

    The `type` attribute specifies the kind of the script.

    In order to indicate that the script is a *classic* script, this attribute can be omitted, set to the empty string or a → https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-mime-type[JavaScript MIME type essence match]
    such as `text/javascript`.

    `text/javascript`: default
     -
    `application/ld+json`: See → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/LD
     -
    `text/ecmascript`
     -
    `application/ecmascript`
     -
    `application/javascript`

     { Module type

      Setting `type="module"` specifies the script to be a *JavaScript module script*.

     }

  }
  { defer, async

   `defer` and `async` are boolean attributes.

    Classic scripts:
      • `async` causes the script to be fetched in parallel and to be parsed and executed as soon as possible (sometimes even before parsing is complete)
      • `defer` causes the script to be fetched in parallel and to be evaluated when is finished parsing.
      • These attributes cannot be specified for class scripts if the `src` attribute is present.
      • Because historical → development/web/browser[browsers] that only support `defer`, but not `async`, both attributes can be specified. In this case, it behaves as if only `defer` was specified.

    Module scripts:
      • `defer` has no effect
      • ???
