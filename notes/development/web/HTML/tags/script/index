$ HTML element: script
@ script

The `<script>` tag is intended to include script and data blocks into a HTML documnet, *not* to store content which is (directly) rendered for the user.

{ Self closing tags

  This one seems to work:
code {
<script src='xyz.js'></script>
code }

  Using `<script … />` (self closing tag) does not seem to work (at least not in Chrome):
code {
<script src='xyz.js' />
code }

}
{ Attributes

  Attributes that are relevant to the `<script>` element are
  table { ll
    `src` ☰ Address (URL?) of the script
    `type` ☰ *empty*, or `module`: a JavaScript module, or `importmap`: an import map. Any other value interprets the script as an (unprocessed) data block.
    `nomodule` ☰ A boolean attribute that allows to prevent a script from being executed in user agents that support module scripts.
    `async` ☰ A boolean attribute to execute the script as soon as it is available
    `defer` ☰ A boolean attribute to defer execution
    `crossorigin` ☰ A → development/web/HTTP/Cross-origin-resource-sharing setting attribute.
    `integrity` ☰
    `referrerpolicy` ☰
  table }

  { src

    In order to load an → development/languages/JavaScript/inline-vs-external[external JavaScript resource], the `src` attribute must be set to the
    → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] where that resource is located.

  }
  { type

    The `type` attribute specifies the kind of the script.

    In order to indicate that the script is a *classic* script, this attribute can be omitted, set to the empty string or a → https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-mime-type[JavaScript MIME type essence match]
    such as `text/javascript`.

    `text/javascript`: default
     -
    `application/ld+json`: See → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON/LD
     -
    `text/ecmascript`
     -
    `application/ecmascript`
     -
    `application/javascript`

     { Module type #html-script-type-module

       Setting `type="module"` specifies the script to be a *JavaScript module script*.

       See also the Javascript → development/languages/JavaScript/language/declarations/import[`import`] declaration

     }

  }
  { defer, async

   `defer` and `async` are boolean attributes.

    Classic scripts:
      • `async` causes the script to be fetched in parallel and to be parsed and executed as soon as possible (sometimes even before parsing is complete)
      • `defer` causes the script to be fetched in parallel and to be evaluated when is finished parsing.
      • These attributes cannot be specified for class scripts if the `src` attribute is present.
      • Because historical → development/web/browser[browsers] that only support `defer`, but not `async`, both attributes can be specified. In this case, it behaves as if only `defer` was specified.

    Module scripts:
      • `defer` has no effect
      • ???

  Using the `<script>` tag to specify the → development/web/WebGL/GLSL/source-code[source code for WebGL].

  There is also a `<noscript>` tag.

  An example to examine → development/web/HTML/tags/script/when-executed[when an (inline) Javascript is executed]

  → development/web/HTML/tags

 `→ development/web/browser/object-model/document[document].scripts`
  -
 `→ development/web/browser/object-model/document[document].currentScript` returns the currently running `<script>` tag (which is not a JavaScript module).
