$ HTML tag: meta

The `<meta>` tag comes in two forms:
code {
<meta name="…" content="…" />
code}
and
code {
<meta http-equiv"…" content="…" />
code }
However, there seems to be the special case
code {
<meta charset="utf-8">
code }

In the first form, the ~name attribute~ can have one of the following values:
  • description
  • keywords
  • author
  • robots
-
→ Companies-Products/Google does not honor the description and keywords attribute anymore in order to rank a page.

In the second form, the ~http-equiv attribute~  can have one of the following values:
  • Content-Type (See → development/web/HTML/characterset)
  • refresh (See → development/web/HTML/redirection)

{ name="robots" for search engines and bots

With `name="robots"`, all → web/Search-Engines/[search engines] are addressed. In order to
address → Companies-Products/Google only, use `<meta name="googlebot" …>`.

code {
<meta name="robots" content="noindex"   /> <!-- Don't index the page                                -->
<meta name="robots" content="nofollow"  /> <!-- Don't follow links on the page                      -->
<meta name="robots" content="nosnippet" /> <!-- Don't show a text snippet in the search result pane -->
<meta name="robots" content="noarchive" /> <!-- Don't archive the content of the page, no cache.    -->
code }

Multiple options can be joined with a comma
code {
<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nosnippet,noarchive" />
code }

}
{ name="viewport" for mobile devices

  The `viewport` instruction only affects mobile brosers; it has no effect on desktops.

code {
<meta name="viewport" content="width=1024" />
code }

code {
<meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.00, maximum-scale=0.75, user-scalable=0">
code }


}
