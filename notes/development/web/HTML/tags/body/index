$ HTML element: body

? The `<body>` element is the second and last child element of the → development/web/HTML/tags/head[`<head>`] element.

With → development/languages/JavaScript, the `<body>` element can be accessed via
→ development/web/DOM/examples/Node/Document/body[`document.body`].

{ onload=…

  Some (possibly old) web pages use `<body onload="…">` to call a JavaScript function when the page is loaded.

  Using the `onload` attribute is deprecated in favor of putting the function to be called in a → development/web/HTML/tags/script[`<script>`] at the end of a page:
code {
→ development/web/HTML/tags/html[<html>]
  → development/web/HTML/tags/head[<head>] … </head>
  <body>
  </body>

  <script>
    …
  </script>
</html>
code }

}
