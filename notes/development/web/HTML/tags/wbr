$ HTML element: wbr

`<wbr>` marks a position with a *word break opportunity*. A (HTML rendering) → development/web/browser might choose to break the word at the given position and
start a new line with the reminder of the word. Thus, it is possible to render text content within confines whose width is too small for a word to be printed in its
entirity.

When `<wbr>` kicks in, the word is just broken without using a hyphen to indicate the word break.
-
In order to also add a hyphen, the `&shy;` (= soft hyphen) → development/web/HTML/entities[entity] is needed.
-
This is demonstrated with the following → development/web/HTML fragment:
gh|about-html|/tags/wbr/compare-with-shy.html||

This HTML piece produces:
gh|about-html|/tags/wbr/img/compare-with-shy.png||

sa:
  → development/web/HTML/tags
