$ HTML element: base

The `<base>` uses one or both of the following attributes for the noted purpose:
table { lll
   ~Attribute~ ☰ ~Purpose~ ☰ ~Misc~
  `href` ☰ Specify the document's *base URL*, used when parsing URLs (for example in → development/web/HTML/tags/a[`<a href="…" …`] or → development/web/HTML/tags/img[`<img src="…">`]). ☰ The value can be accessed in → development/languages/JavaScript with `→ development/web/DOM/interfaces-mixins/Node[Node].baseURI`.
  `target` ☰ The default navigable, used for following hyperlinks ☰
table }

There can (should) be at most one `<base>` element in a document.

Open Graph tags are not influenced by the `<base>` element; they should always have a full URL.

{ Simple snippet

  In the following example, the first link points to `https://server.xyz/path/to/root/dir/sub/abc.html`
  and the second one to `https://server.xyz/top/abc.html`.
  -
  This is because the first link does not start with a slash, but the second one does.

code {
<base href="https://server.xyz/path/to/root/dir/">

<a href="sub/abc.html">relative link</a>

<a href="/top/abc.html">absolute link</a>
code }

}

sa:
  → development/web/HTML/tags
