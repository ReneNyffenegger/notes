$ HTML: div vs. span

What sets the → development/web/HTML/tags/div[`<div>`] tag most apart from the → development/web/HTML/tags/span[`<span>`] tag is that the value of
the → development/web/CSS/properties/display[`display` property] for `<div>` is `block` while that value for `<span>` is `inline`.
-
This is to say: a `<span>` is a *textual* container, a `<div>` is a *layout* container.

It should be noted however that it is possible in → development/web/CSS to override these property-values.
