$ HTML element: col

The `<col>` tag allows to set a limited number of CSS properties (such as the background color) for columns within → development/web/HTML/tags/table[HTML tables].
-
`color` does not belong to this limited set and thus has no effect in the following example:
gh|about-html|/tags/col.html||

sa:

  → development/web/HTML/tags, `<colgroup>`
