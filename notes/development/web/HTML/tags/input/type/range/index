$ HTML tag: input (type=range)

An → development/web/HTML/tags/input[`<input>`] tag whose `type` → development/web/HTML/attributes[attribute] is `input` allows to enter a numerical value between a certain minimum and
maximum. The value can be adjusted using the mouse on a slider. There are two fundamental event handlers:
  • `onchange` which is only called when the mouse releases the slider
  • `oninput` which is called as the user drags the slider back and forth.

The above screenshot was produced with the following → development/web/HTML document which also demonstrates how the event handlers might be implemented:
