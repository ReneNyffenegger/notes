{ Fixing "content wider than screen" on mobile devices

  Use the → development/web/HTML/tags/meta/viewport[`<meta name="viewport" …>`] directive:
code {
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
code }

  If the page contains images or program code listings that are wider than the mobile device, then the following → development/web/CSS directives might help
code {
#wide-elem {
   overflow: hidden;
}
code }
  The HTML element should be a *block element* (such as a → development/web/HTML/tags[`<div>`]) in order for this to work.

In case of images:
code {
img {
  max-width: 100%
}
code }
However, the image will be shrunk to the width of the mobile if it is wider.
