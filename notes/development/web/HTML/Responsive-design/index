  Use the → development/web/HTML/tags/meta/viewport[`<meta name="viewport" …>`] directive:
code {
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

  If the page contains images or program code listings that are wider than the mobile device, also add the following → development/web/CSS directive:
code {
#wide-elem {
   overflow: hidden;
}
code }


}
