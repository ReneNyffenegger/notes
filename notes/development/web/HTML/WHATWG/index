$ Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
@ WHATWG

The WHATWG was formed in response to the slow development of → development/standards/W3C[World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)] Web standards and W3C's decision to abandon HTML in favor of XML-based technologies.

The WHATWG works on a few standards, some of which include
  • The *HTML Living Standard* (formerly known as HTML 5)
  • The *DOM standard* which defines how W3C DOM Level 3 is to be replaced

sa:
  On 28 May 2019, the → development/standards/W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the → development/web/HTML and → development/web/DOM standards.
