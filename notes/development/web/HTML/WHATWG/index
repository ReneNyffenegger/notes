The WHATWG was formed in response to the slow development of → development/standards/W3C[World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)] Web standards and W3C's decision to abandon HTML in favor of XML-based technologies.

The WHATWG works on a few standards, some of which include
  • The → development/web/HTML/WHATWG/living-standard (formerly known as HTML 5)
  • The *DOM standard* which defines how W3C DOM Level 3 is to be replaced
