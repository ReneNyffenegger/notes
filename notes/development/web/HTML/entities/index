$ HTML character entities

Some characters, notable '<', '>' and '&' have a special meaning in → development/web/HTML und must be encoded to preserve the meaning. The encoded characters
are *HTML entities*. The `<` is represented (or encoded) into a `&lt;`, the `>` into a `&gt;` and the `&` into a `&amp;`.
-
Generally, an entity starts with an ampersand (`&`) and ends with a semicolon (`;`).
