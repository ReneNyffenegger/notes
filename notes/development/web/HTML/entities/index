$ HTML character entities

Some characters, notable `<`, `>` and `&` have a special meaning in → development/web/HTML und must be encoded to preserve the meaning. The encoded characters
are *HTML entities*. The `<` is represented (or encoded) into a `&lt;`, the `>` into a `&gt;` and the `&` into a `&amp;`.
-
Generally, an entity starts with an ampersand (`&`) and ends with a semicolon (`;`).

Umlaute: `&xuml;`

Gravis: `&xgrave;`

Circumflex: `&xcirc;`

Script: `&xscr;`

Fractur: `&xfrc;`

Doubly lined(?): `&xopf;`

Fractionals: `&fracAB` (A for example 2, B for example 3)

Cyrillic: `&xcy;` (`x` might be `L` or `Sh` etc.)

Greek: `&rho;` (the name of the letter is written out)

`&shy;` is the soft hyphen: it inserts a hyphen and breaks the line, if necessary. See the → development/web/HTML/tags/wbr[`<wbr>` HTML element] for a demonstration.

`&nbsp;` is a *non-breaking space*.
-
A *non-breaking hyphen* can be inserted with `&#8209;` or `&#x2011;`, there is no mnemonic.
