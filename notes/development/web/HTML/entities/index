$ HTML character entities

A *HTML entity* starts with an ampersand (`&`) and ends with a semicolon (`;`).
-
The portion between the ampersand is either a
  ‚Ä¢ Unicode ‚Üí development/Unicode/Codepoints[code point] number, or a
  ‚Ä¢ Mnemonic

In case of a code point, code point number follows a pound sign (`#`) which follows the ampersand:
  ‚Ä¢ `&#xuuuu` (hexadecimal, note the `x`)
  ‚Ä¢ `&#uuuuu` (decimal, note the absence of the `x`)

For some code points, there is also a menmonic (such as `&amp;`). With mnemonics, the ampersand is not followed by a pound sign. 

{ &amp;, &lt; and &gt;

  Some characters in HTML have a special meaning and must be encoded to preserve their meaining, notably:
     ‚Ä¢ `<` and `>` because they denote an ‚Üí development/web/HTML/tags[HTML element], and
     ‚Ä¢ `&` because it starts an entity.

  
   The `<` is represented (or encoded) into a `&lt;`, the `>` into a `&gt;` and the `&` into a `&amp;`.

  `&xcy;` ‚ò∞ Cyrillic (`&Lcy; = –õ, `&bcy;` = –±, etc)
  `&rho;`  ‚ò∞ Greek, unline for cyrillic, the name of the letter is written out.
  `&shy;` ‚ò∞ The soft hyphen: it inserts a hyphen and breaks the line, if necessary. See the ‚Üí development/web/HTML/tags/wbr[`<wbr>` HTML element] for a demonstration.
  `&nbsp;` ‚ò∞ A *non-breaking space*. There is no mnemonic for a *non-breaking hyphen*;  it can be inserted with `&#8209;` or `&#x2011;`.
