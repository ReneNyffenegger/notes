$ HTMLElement: dataset
@ dataset

The `dataset` property of a `→ development/web/HTML/DOM/API/interfaces-classes/HTMLElement` object returns a `DOMStringMap` which allows
to read and write to/from an HTML element's → development/web/HTML/attributes#html-attr-data[custom data attributs] (i.e. values of attributes whose names start with `data-`).

The → development/web/HTML document of the following example has three → development/web/HTML/tags/div[divs] which have the `x` and `y` coordinates where they should be positioned in a `data-x` and `data-y` attribute.
-
The → development/languages/JavaScript function then iterates over each div and reads these attributes and positions the divs using the
→ development/web/CSS/properties[CSS properties] `→ development/web/CSS/properties/position`, → development/web/CSS/properties/top-right-bottom-left[`left` and `top`].
