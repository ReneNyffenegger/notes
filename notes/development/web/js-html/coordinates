$ Programming for a web browser: Coordinates of the window, screen and Element object (etc)

The → development/web/DOM/examples/Node/Element/offsetWidth-offsetHeight[`offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight`] properties of an element evaluate to the
actual size, in pixels, that an element occupies on the screen.

An element's → development/web/DOM/examples/Node/Element/clientHeight-Width[`clientWidth` and `clientHeight`] return the size of the element excluding borders, margins and scrollbars
(but including padding).

An element's `scrollWidth` and `scrollHeight` return the full size of an element.
-
This size might be larger than `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` because only part of the element might be visible (and scrolling is necessary to render other parts visible).

→ development/web/browser/object-model/window/innerWidth-innerHeight[`window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight`] return the size of the browser-window's viewport.

→ development/web/browser/object-model/window/outerWidth-outerHeight[`window.outerWidth` and `window.outerHeight`] return the size of the entire
→ development/web/browser[browser] window, including menu, border etc.

→ development/web/browser/object-model/window/scrollX-scrollY[`window.scrollX` and `window.scrollY`] indicate the amount, in pixels, that the document
is scrolled horizontally and vertically.

The size of the screen (monitor) can be determined with → development/web/browser/object-model/screen/width-height[`screen.width` and `screen.height`].
-
However, a browser window might not be placed everywhere on the screen. The boundaries in which the browser window might be placed can be queried
with → development/web/browser/object-model/screen/availWidth-availHeight-availLeft-availTop[`screen.availWidth`, `screen.availHeight`, `screen.availLeft` and `screen.availTop`]

{ Demonstration

  A page that tries to show these coordinates is → https://renenyffenegger.ch/development/web/js-html/coordinates.html[here]
  (source on →  https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-web-development/blob/master/js-html/coordinates.html[github]).

  The screenshot looks like so:
