$ PHP: require_once

`require_once` is like `require()` but includes the file at most once. That is, the second time a file is tried to be included with `require_once()`, it has no effect.

The files to be included are searched in the *include path*, whose value is returned by → development/web/php/snippets/including-files/get_include_path[`get_include_path()`].
