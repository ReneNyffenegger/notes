$ PHP: require_once

`require_once()` is like `require()` but includes the file at most once. That is, the second time a file is tried to be included with `require_once()`, it has no effect.

The files to be included are searched in the *include path*, whose value is returned by → development/web/php/snippets/including-files/get_include_path[`get_include_path()`].

If `require_once()` does not find the file to be included, it raises `E_COMPILE_ERROR` which cannot be caught in a `try … catch` construct. Therefore, one might consider using `include_ince()` instead.
