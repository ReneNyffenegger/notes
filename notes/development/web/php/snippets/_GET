$ PHP code snippets: The $_GET super global variable

`$_GET` is an → development/web/php/snippets/array/associative[associative array] (aka hash or dictionary) that contains the key/value pairs  using *query strings* (sometimes also referred
to as URL parameters).

In `GET` methods, a query string is initiated with a question mark `?`. The following → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] has one key, `val_1` with the value `one`:
code {
https://foo.xy/path/to/something?val_1=one
code }
 
In order to add multiple key/value pairs, the pairs need to be separated by `&`:
code {
https://foo.xy/path/to/something?val_1=one&val_2=two
code }

`$_GET` can be used on all → development/web/HTTP/request-methods[request methods] that use query strings, not only `GET` methods.

The following example prints the values of the query parameters `val_1` and `val_2` and uses a
→ development/web/HTML/tags/form[`<form>`] with → development/web/HTML/tags/input[`<input>`] to assign new values them:
