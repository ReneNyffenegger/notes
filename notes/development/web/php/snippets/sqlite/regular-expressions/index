$ PHP code snippets: regular expressions for SQLite

→ development/databases/SQLite does not come natively with → development/regular-expressions. In → development/web/php, it is possible to import an existing function into the SQLite engine with
`PDO::sqliteCreateFunction()`. The following example tries to demonstrate how the PHP function → development/web/php/regular-expressions#php-preg_match[`preg_match`] is imported and given
the name `regexp_like`. Thus, it is possible to query a table with regular expressions:
