$ PHP code snippets: including files

→ development/web/php/snippets/require_once[`require_once()`]

→ development/web/php/snippets/including-files/get_include_path[`get_include_path()`] returns the value of the *include path* which is a list of
directories, separated by a colon (`:`), that are searched for files when files are included.

{ Suppress error messages

  The following snippet uses the → development/web/php/snippets/error-handling#php-error-control-operator[error control operator (`@`)] to suppress error messages
  when `include_once()` does not find the requested file.

  Additionally, the return value of `include_once()` is tested for success. If it returns false, the script is bailed out.

code {
if (! @include_once("funcs.php")) {
   header('Content-Type: text/plain');
   print("Where is funcs.php?");
   exit(-1);
}
code }

}
