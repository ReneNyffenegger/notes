$ PHP code snippets: arrays
@ array

`array(…)` (like → development/web/php/snippets/list[`list()`]) is not a function but rather a language construct.

{ Add elements to an array

  The following example uses two alternatives to add an element to an array.

  The → development/web/php/snippets/array/foreach[`foreach`] loop prints five elements: one, two, three, four, five.

  See also → development/web/php/snippets/array/push[`array_push()`]

}
{ join

 `join($sep, $ary)` creates a string from the array `$ary` by joining the array's elements by the value of `$sep`.

 `join` is an alias for `implode`.

  gh|about-php|/array/join.html||

 `join` (or the equivalent `implode`) might be used to cheaply print arrays (for example in case of the error *Notice: Array to string conversion*).

}
{ Number of elements in an array

  The number of elements in an array is returned by the function `count($ary)` that takes an array (or an object that implements the `Countable` interface).

  gh|about-php|/array/count.php||

  Other → development/languages[programming languages] sometimes have a member method `length` or something similar to return this number.

}
{ array_map

code {
array_map(function($i) { … }, $ary);
array_map('func_name'       , $ary);
code }
