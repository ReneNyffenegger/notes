$ PHP code snippets: function statement 

{ Assigning a function to a variable

  The following example assigns a function to a variable and then calls the function via that variable.

  It is possible to refer to variables outside of the function when using the `global` statement. These variables evaluate to the value they have when the function is invoked, not when they are assigned.

  → development/web/php/snippets/gettype[`gettype($f)`] reveals that the → development/web/php type of such a function-variable is `object`.

{ Creating a closure

  This example is quite similar to the previous one. The main difference is that the `function` statement is combined with a `use($var)` which captures the value of the variable `$var` at the time when the function is assigned, not when it is called.
  This allows to create a closure.
