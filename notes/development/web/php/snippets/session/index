$ PHP code snippets: managing sessions

`start_session()` checks if a → development/web/HTTP/cookie[cookie] named *PHPSESSID* is present. If not, this cookie is created.

The php engine associates this cookie with an → development/web/php/snippets/array/associative[associative array], named `$_SESSION` which can be used to store values across sessions. These values are not sent between
the → web/webserver and the → development/web/browser.
