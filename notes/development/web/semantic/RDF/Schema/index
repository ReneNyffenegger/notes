$ RDF Schema

*RDF Schema* is an extension of the basic RDF vocabulary that provides a *data-modelling* vocabulary for RDF data.

The core vocabulary of RDF Schema is in the namespace `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`.
-
This namespace is typically associated with the prefix `rdfs:`.

Concerning the two prefixes `rdf:` and `rdfs:`, the → https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/#section-vocabulary[RDF 1.1 Primer] says:
"
  The fact that the constructs have two different prefixes (rdf: and rdfs:) is a somewhat annoying historical artefact, which is preserved for backward compatibility.

table { ll
  `rdfs:Resource` ☰ The root class in RDF Schema. All other classes are subclasses of this class.
  `rdfs:Class` ☰ The group of resources that are classes. So, for example, `rdfs:Resource` or `rdfs:Class` are instances of `rdfs:Class`.
  `rdfs:subClassOf` ☰ States that a class is a subclass of another
  `rdfs:Literal` ☰ The class of literal values.
  `rdfs:Datatype` ☰ The class of datatypes. Each instance of `rdfs:Datatype` is a subclass of `rdfs:Literal`
  `rdf:langString` ☰ The class of language tagged string values. `rdf:langString` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a subclass of `rdfs:Literal`
  `rdf:HTML` ☰ The class of HTML literal values.
  `rdf:XML` ☰ The class of XML literal values.
  `rdf:Property` ☰ The class of RDF properties.
  `rdfs:subPropertyOf` ☰ Used to state that one property is a subproperty of another property.
  `rdfs:range` ☰ `prop rdfs:range cls` states that `prop` is an instance of `rdf:Property`, `cls` an instance of `rdfs:Class` and that `prop` denotes object-resources that are instances of `cls`
  `rdfs:domain` ☰ `prop rdfs:domain cls` states that `prop` is an instance of `rdf:Property`, `cls` an instance of `rdfs:Class` and that `prop` denotes subject -resources that are instances of `cls`.
  `rdf:type` ☰ `inst rdf:type cls` states that `cls` is an instance of `rdfs:Class` and `inst` is an instance of `cls`. `rdf:type` is an instance of `rdf:Property`. `rdf:type` can be abbreviated with `a`.
  `rdfs:subClassOf` ☰ 
  `rdfs:subPropertyOf` ☰
  `rdfs:label` ☰ `rsrc rdfs:label lbl` states that `lbl` is a human-readable label of the resource `rsrc`. The `rdfs:domain` of `rdfs:label` is `rdfs:Resource`. The `rdfs:range` of `rdfs:label` is `rdfs:Literal`.
  `rdfs:comment` ☰ Similar to `rdfs:label`, but commant instead of label (?)
  `rdfs:Container` ☰ The super-class of the RDF container classes `rdf:Bag`, `rdf:Seq` and `rdf:Alt`.
  `rdfs:Bag` ☰ Unordered set
  `rdfs:Seq` ☰ Ordered set
  `rdfs:Alt` ☰
  `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` ☰ The instances of this class are the properties `rdf:_1`, `:rdf:_2`, `rdf:_3` …
  `rdfs:member` ☰
  `rdf:List` ☰
  `rdf:first` ☰
  `rdf:rest` ☰
  `rdf:nil` ☰
  `rdf:Statement` ☰ The class of RDF statements
  `rdf:subject` ☰ `rdf:subject` is an instance of `rdf:Property` that states a statement's subject.
  `rdf:predicate` ☰
  `rdf:object` ☰
  `rdfs:seeAlso` ☰
  `rdfs:isDefinedBy` ☰
  `rdf:value` ☰
