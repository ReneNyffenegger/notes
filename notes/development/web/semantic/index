$ Semantic Web

The *Semantic Web* aims at making internet → development/Data machine-readable.

The W3C Semantic Web stack includes technologies such as
  • → development/web/RDF
  • → development/web/semantic/OWL
  • → development/databases/query-languages/SPARQL

The Semantic Web is also referred to as *Web 3.0*.

{ Vision

  Tim Berners-Lee defines the Semantic Web as
  "
    The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one,
    in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers
    and people to work in cooperation
  "  

  According to the W3C, the concept can be defined as
  "
    Semantic Web is the idea of having data on the Web defined and linked in a way that it
    can be used by machines not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration, and
    reuse of data across various applications
  "

  Several technologies were developed and standardized with the goal to achieve this vision: RDF, URIs.
  - 
  Vocabularies, schemas and ontology languages are built on top of RDF and URIs (such as RDF-Schema, OWL and SKOS).

}
{ Ontologies

  An ontology is created with an *ontology language*.

  Among these languages are
    • RDF Schema (RDFS)
    • Web Ontology Language (→ development/web/semantic/OWL)
