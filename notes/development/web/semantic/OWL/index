OWL is a declarative language to express *ontologies* in the → development/web/semantic.

Basic notions of OWL are
table { ll
  Axioms ☰ the statements that an OWL ontology expresses
  Entities ☰ the elements that refer to real-world objects
  Expressions ☰ Combinations of entities to form complex descriptions from basic ones
table }

Resoners are tools that are able to compute consequences from axioms.
