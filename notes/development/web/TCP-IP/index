{ Checking if a port is open

  â†’ http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/[open port checker] checks
  an external IP address and detects open ports on a connection. It's
  useful for finding out if port forwarding is setup correctly or
  if server applications are being blocked by a firewall.
