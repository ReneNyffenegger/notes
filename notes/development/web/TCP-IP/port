{ Checking if a port is open #tcp-check-port-open

  Checking if a port is open is useful to find to if port forwarding is setup correctly or if
  server applications are being blocked by a firewall.

  In the shell, it's possible to check if a port is open with:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/nc -vz localhost 1521 
code }

  In the internet, a web-frontend to check for open ports is → http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/[open port checker].
  -
  Another web tool is → https://ping.eu/port-chk/[here].

  TODO: This should be merged with *Ports* in → development/networking/IP.
