  { Changing styles to a value returned by a JavaScript function

    This example selects all divs and sets the value of their `background-color` style to a random value produced by a → development/languages/JavaScript function.

  }
  { selectAll / data / text / style

    This example uses `selectAll` to select all → development/web/HTML/tags/div[divs], then assigns each div (of which there are four) a color name using the `data()` method.
    -
    The assigned data is then used to set each div's text (`.text()`) and modify the `background-color` style to the value assigned with `data()`:

  { Change styles with a transition

    This example creates for → development/web/HTML/tags/button[buttons] which call the function `transit` with the name of a color.

   `transit()` selects the → development/web/HTML/tags/body[`<body>`] element (`d3.select('body')`) and uses `.transition()` to slowly change the `background-color` style of the body
    to the chosen color.

    The optional call to `duration()` specifies the requested length of the transition in milli-seconds.
