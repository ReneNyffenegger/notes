$ d3.js - Bar Charts

{ Width of DIV

  The following example constructs a → development/Data/visualization/Bar-chart[bar chart] by creating a → development/web/HTML/tags/div/[`<div>`] element for each bar and setting its `width` CSS style.

  First, `d3.select('.bar-chart')` selects the DIV into which the bar chart will be placed (`.bar-chart`) and then applies `selectAll()` (which is not entirely clear to me why this step is needed) and then assigns
  an array of values (`.data()`) and finally creates (`.append()`) the divs for each bar with their corresponding widht and text:

  gh|about-d3.js|/chart/bar/div-width.html||

}
{ scaleLinear

  The following example uses `d3.scaleLinear` to create a function with which the length of the bar chart is scaled across the entire screen.

{ SVG

  This example creates a bar chart using → design/graphic/svg primitives rathern than a DIV element:
