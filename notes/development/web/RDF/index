RDF stands for *Resource Description Framework*.

RDF is intended to give a simple means for making statements about *resources*. A resource can be anything.

RDF tries to capture information in *subject-predicate-object* triples.

{ Triplet

  An *RDF triplet* is a statement with
    • one subject (which is an IRI or a blank node)
    • one predicate (which is an IRI)
    • one object (which is an IRI, (date-type) literal or blank node)

  The subject and object can be thought of a *node*, the predicate as a directed *edge* that connnects these nodes.

  The same IRI might function as both a node or predicate in the same graph.

  IRIs, literals and blank nodes are also referred to as *RDF terms*.

}
{ IRI

  An IRI is a → development/Unicode string that corresponds to the syntax defined in → development/web/RFC#rfc-3987[RFC 3987]. An IRI is absolute and may contain a fragment identifier.

}
{ Graph

  An *RDF graph* is a set of triplets.

}

{ Datasets

  An *RDF dataset* is a collection of RDF graphs.

  One of these graphs is (an unnamed) *default graph*.
  -
  The other graphs have a unique name.

  The default graph may be empty.


}
{ RDF Document

  An *RDF document* contains («encodes») a a graph or dataset an a *concrete RDF syntax*.

  RDF syntaxes that are able to semantically store graphs or datasets include
    • Turtle
    • RDFa
    • JSON-LD
    • TriG

}
{ RDF Vocabulary

  An *RDF vocabulary* provides a set of IRIs which are intended to be used in graphs.

  An examples of such a vocuabluary is → development/web/semantic/RDF/Schema.

  Typically, the IRIs of a vocabulary start with the same substring. This substring is referred to as ~namespace IRI~.
  -
  Namespace IRIs can then be associated with a ~namespace prefix~.

}
{ Literals

  A literal corresponds to a fixed value of and consists of at least two elements:
    • A Unicode string that stores the value in *lexical form*
    • A datatype-IRI that specifies how the lexical form is interpreted

  If the datatype-IRI is `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString`, the literal also has a language tag.
  -
  These literals are referred to as *language-tagged strings*. (See also `rdf:langString`).

{ Data types

  { XML Schema built-in data types

    XML Schema built-in data types have the form `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#*`

  }
  { Other data types

    Other data types include
      • `rdf:HTML`
      • `rdf:XMLLiteral`
