$ window.outerWidth / window.outerHeight

`window.outerWidth` and `window.outerHeight` are supposed to return the size of the browser window. 

In my experiments, the returned values were slightly larger than that of the browser. With Firefox 72.0.2, the width was reported 10 pixels too wide and the
height 5 pixels to high. With Chrome, the width was reported 14 pixels too wide and the height 7 pixels too high.
