$ window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight

`window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight` evaluate to the width and height of the *viewport*.

If scrollbars are present, the *drawable area* of the viewport is slightly smaller than that which is indicated by `innerWidth` and `innerHeight`.

The returned amount of pixel does not represent *physical* pixels on the screen, but the amount of visible pixels that takes into account
the current zoom-in or zoom-out factor. Thus, `window.innerWidth` can be larger than → development/web/browser/object-model/window/outerWidth-outerHeight[`window.outerWidth`] if the content is zoomed in.
