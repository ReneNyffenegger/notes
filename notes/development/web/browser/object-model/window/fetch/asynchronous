$ Javascript/BOM: Demonstration of the asynchronicity of window.fetch()

The following two files can be used to demonstrate the *asynchronicity* of the `→ development/web/browser/object-model/window[window].fetch()` method.

{ service.php

 `service.php` is a → development/web/php script that takes a POST or GET parameter named `sleepSeconds` and then sleeps the indicated number of seconds. When it wakes
  up again, it returns a string to the originator of the request.

  gh|Browser-Object-Model|/window/fetch/asynchronous/service.php||

}
{ main.html

 `main.html` is a → development/web/HTML document that makes three `fetch()` requests to `service.php`: the first requesting to sleep 3 seconds, the second to sleep 1 second, the third to sleep 2 seconds.
  -
  When the `fetch()` request returns, the returned string is written into a prepared → development/web/HTML/tags/div/index[`<div>`] element.

  A log keeps track when the requests were made. It can be seen that the entries into the log are written within less than a fraction of a second, thus prooving that the fetch requests are made in parallel (or asynchronously).
