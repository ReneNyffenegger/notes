  { User agent switcher #firefox-user-agent-switcher

    → https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher: Change the → development/web/HTTP/User-Agent
    -
    Apperantly, this user agent switcher is not compatible with *Firefox Quantum*.

    → https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher seems to be compatible with *Firefox Quantum*, but does not allow to specify a
    user defined agent!

    Finally: → https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher (by RayLo) is both compatible with *Firefox Quantum* and allows to create my personal
    user agent.
