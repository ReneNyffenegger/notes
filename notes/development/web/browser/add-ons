$ Browser add-ons

{ Firefox

  At least in the world of Mozilla/Firefox, *add-ons* is an umbrella term for different types of code that modifies Firefox. Add-ons include
    • Extensions (which can be thought of as an application). Extensions were formerly referred to as *Web Extensions*.
    • Themes
    • Plug-ins
    • Dictionaries
    • etc.

  In 2018 Firefox stopped supporting the old XUL extensions API in favor of Extensions («WebExtensions»).

  Firefox (and Thunderbird) add-ons come in `*.xpi` files (which is actually a → development/archive-files/zip[zip file]). They're installed under
  → Linux/fhs/home/username/_mozilla/firefox/abcd5678_default/extensions

  → https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-search-link-fix/[Google search link fix]: to copy links from → Companies-Products/Google[Google's] search result pane.

  See also the → development/web/browser/Firefox/profile-folder/extensions[extensions] folder
  and the → development/web/browser/Firefox/profile-folder/addons_json[`addons.json`] file in the → development/web/browser/Firefox/profile-folder[profile folder].

  { User agent switcher #firefox-user-agent-switcher

    → https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher: Change the → development/web/HTTP/User-Agent
    -
    Apperantly, this user agent switcher is not compatible with *Firefox Quantum*.

    → https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher seems to be compatible with *Firefox Quantum*, but does not allow to specify a
    user defined agent!

    Finally: → https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher (by RayLo) is both compatible with *Firefox Quantum* and allows to create my personal
    user agent.
