$ Chrome: user data directory

The *user data directory* stores a user's profiles data such as the
  • the history (which seems to be stored in → development/web/browser/Chrome/user-data-directory/_profile/History[an SQLite Database named `History`].
  • bookmarks
  • → development/web/HTTP/cookie[cookies]

Each *profile* is a subdirectory of the user data directory. The default name for a profile is typically `Default`.

In a Windows installation of Chrome, the default location for the *user data directory* is
→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User-Data[`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data`].
