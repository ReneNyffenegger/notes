$ Firefox profile folder: prefs.js
@ prefs.js

`prefs.js` stores customized user preference settings, such as changes made in the options dialogs.

This file contains entries such as `user_pref("devtools.browserconsole.filter.csserror", false);`. Apparently, this file should not be modified manually, at least not while Firefox is running. However,
settings in this file can be overwritten in the (optional) â†’ development/web/browser/Firefox/profile-folder/user_js[`user.js`] file.
