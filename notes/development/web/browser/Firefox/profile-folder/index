{ Location of profile folder

  The location of the profile folder can be found by entering `about:support` into the address bar. In the page that opens, it can be searched for *Profile Folder* (Ctrl-F) next to which
  the location is revealed.

  By default, the profile folder is found in *Windows* under
    → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles[`%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`] and in *Linux* under
    → Linux/fhs/home/username/_mozilla/firefox[`~/.mozilla/firefox`].

  { Portable apps

    Apparently, *portable apps* starts firefox with the `-P` option to specify the profile `…\PortableApps\FirefoxPortable\Data\profile`.

    The portable apps profile is claimed to have *disk cache* turned off.
