    • a history
    • bookmarks
    • settings
    • add ons
    
   In Windows, the default location for profiles is 
   → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles[`%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`].
   -
   A profile is stored in a sub directory under that directory.
   -
   The profiles are also found in the → development/web/browser/Firefox/profiles_ini[`profile.ini`] file.
   
   Information about profiles is shown with `about:profiles`.
