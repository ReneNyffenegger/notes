{ Storing data

  Apparently, there are (only?) three ways to store data in a browser:
    • LocalStorage: stores key-value pairs
    • WebSQL: interface to → development/databases/SQLite, only supported in Chrome and Safari
    • → development/web/browser/Storage/Indexed-DB: The sucessor to both of them

}
