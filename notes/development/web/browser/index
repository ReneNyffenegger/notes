{ Storing data

  Apparently, there are (only?) three ways to store data in a browser:
    • LocalStorage: stores key-value pairs
    • WebSQL: interface to → development/databases/SQLite, only supported in Chrome and Safari
    • → development/web/browser/Storage/Indexed-DB: The sucessor to both of them

}

sa:
  → development/web/browser/layout-engine

  → development/web/browser/fingerprinting

  → development/web/browser/add-ons

  → development/web/browser/Firefox, → development/web/browser/Chrome
  -
  → development/web/browser/Internet-Explorer and its successor(?) → development/web/browser/Edge

  → development/web/browser-automation

  → development/web/browser/object-model

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/rundll32_exe/url_bat[`url.bat`] uses `rundll32` to open an
  → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] in the default browser (?) in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe].

  → development/web/browser/WebAssembly: A programming language that runs on browsers.
