{ Storing data

  Apparently, there are (only?) three ways to store data in a browser:
    • LocalStorage: stores key-value pairs
    • WebSQL: interface to → development/databases/SQLite, only supported in Chrome and Safari
    • → development/web/browser/Storage/Indexed-DB: The sucessor to both of them

}

  → development/web/browser/add-ons

  → development/web/browser/Firefox

  → development/web/browser/Internet-Explorer

  → development/web/browser-automation

  → development/web/browser/object-model

  → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL/rundll32_exe/url_bat[`url.bat`] uses `rundll32` to open an
  → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] in the default browser (?) in → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe].
