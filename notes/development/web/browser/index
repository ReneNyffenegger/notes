{ Storing data

  Apparently, there are (only?) three ways to store data in a browser:
    • LocalStorage: stores key-value pairs (but compare also to SessionStorage)
    • WebSQL: interface to → development/databases/SQLite, only supported in Chrome and Safari
    • → development/web/browser/Storage/Indexed-DB: The sucessor to both of them

  → development/Data in *SessionStorage* survives a page refresh, data in *LocalStorage* even a restart of a browser.

}
{ JavaScript / ECMAScript

  Most browsers come with the ability to run programs locally (that is in the web browser itself as opposed to in the → web/webserver). This programming language is based on the ECMAScript language and
  implemented as → development/languages/JavaScript.
