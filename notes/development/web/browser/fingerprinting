$ Web browser fingerprinting

Web browser fingerprinting is a technique to identify a web browser (and thus indirectly a web user) based on various characteristics that the browser exhibits.

Among the characteristics that allow to fingerprint a browser are
  • → development/languages/Perl/modules/_additional_files_/UserAgentStrings[User agent strings]
  • → development/web/HTTP/header[HTTP accept headers]
  • Screen resolution
  • Timezone
  • supported MIME types
  • a list of system fonts
  • a list of installed browser plugins
  • canvas fingerprinting (eg by measuring how anti aliased lines are drawn)
