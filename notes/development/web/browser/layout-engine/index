Most web browser's *layout engines* operate in one of three modes:
  • Quirks mode
  • Almost standard mode
  • Full standard mode

The mode that a document is rendered in is controlled by the document's → development/web/HTML/DOCTYPE-declaration[DOCTYPE declaration]. The DOCTYPE declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that a document follows *full standard mode*.
