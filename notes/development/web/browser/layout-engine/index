{ Rendering mode #browser-rendering-mode

  Most → development/web/browser[web browsers's] *layout engines* operate in one of three rendering modes:
    • Quirks mode
    • Limited-quirks mode (formerly: Almost standard mode)
    • No-quirks mode (formerly: Full standard mode)

  Apparently, in more recent times, it makes no sense anymore to distinguish between *Almost standard* and *standard* mode.

  The mode that a document is rendered in is controlled by the document's → development/web/HTML/DOCTYPE-declaration[DOCTYPE declaration].
  The DOCTYPE declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that a document follows *no-quirks mode*.

  In → development/languages/JavaScript, the mode currently in effect can be determined with the property `→ development/web/browser/object-model/document/compatMode`.

  { Root element

    In no-quirks mode, the root element is `→ development/web/DOM/examples/Node/Document/documentElement` (i. e. the HTML element).
    -
    In quirks mode, the root element is `document.body` (i. e. the BODY element).

  }

}
