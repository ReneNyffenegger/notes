{ Rendering mode #browser-rendering-mode

  Most web browser's *layout engines* operate in one of three rendering modes:
    • Quirks mode
    • Almost standard mode
    • Full standard mode

  Apparantly, in more recent times, it makes no sense anymore to distinguis between *Almost standard* and *standard* mode.

  The mode that a document is rendered in is controlled by the document's → development/web/HTML/DOCTYPE-declaration[DOCTYPE declaration].
  The DOCTYPE declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that a document follows *full standard mode*.

  In → development/languages/JavaScript, the mode currently in effect can be determined with the property → development/web/browser/object-model/document#document-compatMode[`document.compatMode`].
