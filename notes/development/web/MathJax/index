{ Getting started

  Formulas can be displayed in a → development/web/HTML document with MathJax.

  To do so, the document needs to include the MathJax library:
code {
<→ development/web/HTML/tags/script async src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=…"></script>
code }

  MathJax's documentation has the following note about the `config` parameter (`TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML`):
  "
    The TeX-MML-AM_CHTML configuration is one of the most general (and thus
    largest) combined configuration files. We list it here because it
    will quickly get you started using MathJax. It is probably not the most
    efficient configuration for your purposes and other combined
    configuration files are available. 
  "

  A MathJax formula can then be displayed by putting it between two double-dollar signs:
code {
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
code }

  In-line formulas must be put between single dollar signs (`$a \ne $b`).
  -
  However, for that to work, the following MathJax configuration needs to be added in the document:
code {
  <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']]}});
  </script>
code }

}
{ config=AM_CMHTML (Ascii Math)

  The following example uses `config=AM_CMHTML` which enables entering (simple) formulas more
  readably.
  -
  With this configuration, the formula is enclosed in backticks.

{ Left aligning formulas

  { Using <table> to left align formulas

    By default, MathJax centers a (non-inline) formula on the page.

    When putting it into a → development/web/HTML/tags/table[`<table>`], it is rendered left aligned. I would assume that there are more canonical ways to achieve this,
    but that was the first and cheapest one that worked for me.

  { The more canonical way?

   *Update 2023-01-23*: is using `$\begin{aligned} … \end{aligned}$` the more canonical way to left align formulas? At least it seems so:
