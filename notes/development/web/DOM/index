{ Interfaces and Mixins

  The DOM standard specifies a few interfaces (think: objects) and mixins that allow a programming language (usually → development/languages/JavaScript) to manipulate the elements that are stored in a DOM tree.

  These interfaces are:
    • AbortController
    • AbortSignal
    • AbstractRange
    • Attr
    • CDATASection
    • CharacterData
    • Comment
    • CustomEvent
    • Document (which is significantly extended by the Document interface of HTML)
    • DocumentFragment
    • DocumentType
    • DOMImplementation
    • DOMTokenList
    • → development/web/DOM/interfaces-mixins/Element (from which objects correspdonding to HTML elements such as `HTMLElement`, `HTMLDivElement`, `HTMLBodyElement` etc. interfaces inherit)
    • Event
    • → development/web/DOM/interfaces-mixins/EventTarget (implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them).
    • → development/web/DOM/interfaces-mixins/HTMLCollection
    • NamedNodeMap
    • → development/web/DOM/interfaces-mixins/Node
    • NodeFilter
    • NodeIterator
    • NodeList
    • MutationObserver
    • MutationRecord
    • ProcessingInstruction
    • Range 
    • ShadowRoot
    • StaticRange
    • Text
    • TreeWalker
    • XPathEvaluator
    • XPathExpression
    • XPathResult

  The mixins are
    • ChildNode
    • DocumentOrShadowRoot
    • NonDocumentTypeChildNode
    • NonElementParentNode
    • ParentNode
    • Slotable
    • XPathEvaluatorBase

  These interfaces and mixins are described with → development/web/IDL.
