An `HTMLCollection` is a *collection* of elements (element nodes).
-
In spite of its name, a `HTMLCollection` can also contain non-HTML elements (compare for example with `→ development/web/DOM/interfaces-mixins/NodeList`).
This is because the name was chosen before modern DOM emerged.

The `HTMLCollection` is considered an *old style* collection and «a historical artifact we cannot get rid of». If possible, `sequence<T>` should be used instead.

  Becaue a `HTMLCollection` is a live object, the → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection[documentation] recommends to make a copy with
 `→ development/languages/JavaScript/objects/Array[Array].from()`.

  An `HTMLCollection` is for example returned by
    • → development/web/DOM/examples/Node/Document/getElementsByTagName[`document.getElementsByTagName`]
