$ DOM example: createElement

The following example uses `document.createElement('div')` to dynamically create a
→ development/web/HTML/tags/div[`<div>` HTML tag].

The new element's `innerHTML` is then assigned the text to be displayed in the div.

Using the `style` attribute, some of the elements → development/web/CSS styles are modified so that the new element stands out more clearly.
-
The `background` and `color` attribute seem to be self-explanotary. Setting the `float` attribute to `left` makes sure that the div does not occupy more space
than required.

Finally, the div is placed into the → development/web/DOM[DOM] tree inside the → development/web/HTML/tags/body[`<body>`] tag. The `<body>` can easily be referenced in → development/languages/JavaScript with `document.body`.
