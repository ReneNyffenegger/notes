{ Foxit Reader

  → https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader[Foxit Reader] is free, and despite its name allows basic annotations to a PDF document.

  { Installing #foxit-install

    Foxit Reader can be installed with → Windows/Chocolatey:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco_exe[choco] install foxitreader
code }

    The following line installs Foxit Reader
      • without desktop icon
      • without default file association
      • without browser plugin and
      • without ConnectedPDF:
code {
choco install foxitreader --ia '/MERGETASKS="!desktopicon,!setdefaultreader,!displayinbrowser /COMPONENTS=*pdfviewer,*ffse,*installprint,*ffaddin,*ffspellcheck,!connectedpdf"'
code }

    { Specifying a language

code {
choco install foxitreader --ia '/MERGETASKS="!desktopicon /COMPONENTS=*pdfviewer,*ffse,*installprint,*ffaddin,*ffspellcheck,!connectedpdf" /LANG=en'
code }

      Note, although `/LANG=en` is specified, the installation executable is downloaded from an URL such as
code {
https://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/latest.php?product=Foxit-Reader&platform=Windows&package_type=exe&language=German&version=$version
code }

      This `language=German` *seemed* to ignore my request for an english installation, but the → https://github.com/ComFreek/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/foxitreader/update.ps1[installer's source code] has this
      helpful comment:
    "
      The "&language=German' parameter will force the download of "FoxitReader941_L10N_Setup_Prom.exe" containing all available languages.
    "

    }

  { Misc

    Images can be added in the menu *home*, with *Image Annotation* (on the far right side).

{ Unlocking secured PDFs

  PDFs can be secured so that the cannot be edited anymore.

  One way to make them editable is just to print them into another PDF document. However, this «solution» might blow up the size of the PDF (probably if it contains some raster graphics?).
  So, another way to remove this protection is to use `qpdf` (which can be downloaded from → https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/releases[its releases page on github]) like so
code {
C:\users\rene> qpdf.exe --decrypt secured.pdf unlocked.pdf
code }

}

  Xournal was helpful when I wanted to *add images* onto a pdf.
