$ script-fu-compat.init

The Scheme code in this file provides some compatibility with scripts that were
originally written for use with the older SIOD based Script-Fu plug-in of â†’ design/graphic/GIMP.

All items defined in this file except for the random number routines are
deprecated. Existing scripts should be updated to avoid the use of the
compatibility functions and define statements which follow the random number 
generator routines.

  This file defines `*pi*` as
