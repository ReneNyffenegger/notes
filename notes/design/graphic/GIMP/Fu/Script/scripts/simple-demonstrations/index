$ GIMP Script-Fu: simple demonstration scripts (to be executed in batch mode from the command line)

{ Setting the background

  The following script is probably one of the most simple one possible. It creates 250 pixel by 100 pixel image with a blue background
  and saves the image as *jpg* file into the directory `f:\img`:

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/background.scm||

  The resulting image is:
  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/img/background.jpg||

  In → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], this script is executed like so
code {
P:\ath\to\source> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/type background.scm | "→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files[C:\Program Files]\GIMP 2\bin\gimp-2.10.exe" -d -i -f -s -b -
code }

}
{ Line

  The following example draws two lines, one with `gimp-pencil` and once with `gimp-paintbrush`.
  -
  GIMP's → https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-tool-pencil.html[user manual] says the following about the
 *difference between a pencil and a paintbrush*:
  "
    The pencil and paintbrush are similar tools. The main difference between
    the two tools is that although both use the same type of brush, the pencil
    tool will not produce fuzzy edges, even with a very fuzzy brush. It does
    not even do anti-aliasing. 
  "

  The line that goes from top left to bottom right is drawn with a pencil while the other
  one is drawn with a paintbrush:

{ Circle

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/circle.scm||

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/img/circle.jpg||

}
{ Filled circle

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/filled-circle.scm||

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/img/filled-circle.jpg||

code {
P:\ath\to\source> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/type filled-circle.scm | "→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files[C:\Program Files]\GIMP 2\bin\gimp-2.10.exe" -i -s    -b -
code }

  TODO: This example is similar to http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/misc/tools/script_fu/ex_12.html[this one], but uses `gimp-drawable-edit-fill` while the other
  one uses `gimp-edit-bucket-fill`.

{ Text

  Write *Hello world*:
  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/text.scm||

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/img/text.jpg||

code {
P:\ath\to\source> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/type text.scm | "→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files[C:\Program Files]\GIMP 2\bin\gimp-2.10.exe" -d -i -f    -b -
code }

}
{ Brush spacing

  Using `gimp-context-set-brush-spacing` allows to set a distance between «points» where the brush is applied on a line,
  thus creating a dotted line.

{ Using a function to draw a star

  The following example defines a function `define draw-line…` to make it (a bit) easier to draw a line.

  This function is called repeadetly to draw a star:

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/function-star.scm||

  gh|GIMP-Fu-Scripts|/simple-demonstrations/img/function-star.jpg||

code {
P:\ath\to\source> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/type function-star.scm | "→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files[C:\Program Files]\GIMP 2\bin\gimp-2.10.exe"    -i    -s -b -
code }

}
