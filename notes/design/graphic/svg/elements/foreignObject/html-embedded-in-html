$ SVG - foreignObject: HTML embedded in HTML

The `<foreignObject`> SVG element allows to include elements from a different → development/XML namespace, for example
→ development/web/HTML/tags[HTML elements].

The following example tries to demonstrate how a rotated → development/web/HTML/tags/div[`<div>`] can be embedded in an
→ design/graphic/svg document, which itself is embedded in a → development/web/HTML document:
gh|about-svg|/elements/foreignObject/img/html-embedded-in-html.png||

{ HTML source

  This example was produced with the following source code:
  gh|about-svg|/elements/foreignObject/html-embedded-in-html.html||

}
