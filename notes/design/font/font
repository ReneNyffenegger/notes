A *font* is a collection of → design/font/glyph[glyphs] of a specific → design/font/typeface at one
particular type size («appearance») excluding bold/italic attributes.

The OS converts a number (for example a codepoint) into the required shape on the screen or print output.

For, example, with *Wingdings*, 65 does not represent an `A` but a *victory hand* (cf → http://www.alanwood.net/demos/wingdings.html)

{ Some fonts

  ~Caledonia~ is a type face designed 1939, by William Addison Dwiggins (1880-1956), for the Mergenthaler Linotype Company.

  Caledonia is the Roman name for Scotland. Dwiggins chose this name because he was inspired by the Scottish types cast by
  Alexander Wilson & Son.

  Unfortunately, the font (at least the monospaced version of it) doesn't support some special characters that are
  important to me.
