A *font* is a collection of → design/font/glyph[glyphs] of a specific → design/font/typeface at one
particular type size («appearance») excluding bold/italic attributes.

The OS converts a number (for example a codepoint) into the required shape on the screen or print output.

For, example, with *Wingdings*, 65 does not represent an `A` but a *victory hand* (cf → http://www.alanwood.net/demos/wingdings.html)
