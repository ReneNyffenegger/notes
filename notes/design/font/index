{ Web

  Apparently, browsers are shifting towards the WOFF and WOFF 2 standard (→ https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff and → https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2).

}
{ Linux #linux

  The standard Linux font format is PSF (the *PC Screen Fonts*).

  If a font provides both, TTF and OTF, the OTF is to be preferred as it provides more features to programs who know how to use them.

}
{ FreeType2

  FreeType2 is a library to render TrueType fonts.

  Information about the installed library can be obtained with
code {
freetype-config --version
freetype-config --libtools
freetype-config --libs
code }
  etc.

}
{ CID fonts

  CID = character indexed.

  A CID font consists of
    • a glyph file and
    • a mapping (CMap) file

  The CMap defines the mapping between the characters in the font and the → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encoding] used to address them.

  CID font names are a concatenation of the name of the font and the name of the CMap.
