{ CID fonts

  CID = character indexed.

  A CID font consists of
    • a glyph file and
    • a mapping (CMap) file

  The CMap defines the mapping between the characters in the font and the → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encoding] used to address them.

  CID font names are a concatenation of the name of the font and the name of the CMap.
