{ Web

  Apparently, browsers are shifting towards the WOFF and WOFF 2 standard (→ https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff and → https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2).

{ Linux #linux

  The standard Linux font format is PSF (the *PC Screen Fonts*).

  If a font provides both, TTF and OTF, the OTF is to be preferred as it provides more features to programs who know how to use them.

  { Fontconfig / Xft #fontconfig-Xft
  
   *Fontconfig* is a library for font management: it locates and selects fonts in the system based on criteria requested by an application (such as font family, style, language support).

    Fontconfig comes with a few programs:
    table { ll
      `→ Linux/shell/commands/fc-match` ☰ Test matching ruiles
      `→ Linux/shell/commands/fc-list` ☰ List installed fonts
      `fc-cache` ☰ Maintenance of the fontconfig cache
      `fc-cat` ☰ Dump the binar cache files in string form
    table }
    
    Fontconfig does not depend on the → Linux/X[X Window System].
    -
   *Xft* is an → Linux/X[X-specific] library that uses fontconfig (and freetype) to specify and rasterize fonts.

     See also `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_cache/fontconfig`

  }
  { Installing a TTF font

    The following command sequence → https://gist.github.com/matthewhartman/7b1661dbe6ff26a231e4[supposedly installs a TTF on a Linux system]:
code {
cp xyz.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype
cd         /usr/share/fonts/truetype
mkfontscale     # creates file fonts.scale
mkfontdir       # creates file fonts.dir
fc-cache
xset fp rehash
code }

     Check if font is installed:
code {
fc-list | grep xyz
code }

  }

}
{ FreeType2

  FreeType2 is a library to render TrueType fonts.

  Information about the installed library can be obtained with
code {
freetype-config --version
freetype-config --libtools
freetype-config --libs
code }
  etc.

}
{ CID fonts

  CID = character indexed.

  A CID font consists of
    • a glyph file and
    • a mapping (CMap) file

  The CMap defines the mapping between the characters in the font and the → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encoding] used to address them.

  CID font names are a concatenation of the name of the font and the name of the CMap.
