$ ISO 10646

ISO 10646 defines a large set of → development/Unicode/character[characters]: the so called *Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)*. The UCS contains most characters that are found in any of the
world's writing systems.

The same set of characters is also defined by → development/Unicode


{ Adoption of ISO 10646 #adoption-iso-10646

  UCS also proposed → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encodings]. However, these were not practical for many purposes, mostly because they were not compatible with already installed applications or
  existing protocols.

  Thus, ISO 10646 was not easily adopted at first.

  This obstacle was addressed with the development of → development/Unicode/UTF-8.
