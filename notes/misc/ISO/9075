$ ISO/IEC 9075

SQL-86 (or SQL-87) is the ISO 9075:1987 standard of 1987

SQL-89 is the ISO/IEC 9075:1989 standard of 1989

SQL-92 is the ISO/IEC 9075:1992 standard of 1992 - it added *foreign* and *primary key* constraints and allowed *subqueries* in place of named tables.

{ SQL:1999

  SQL:1999 is the ISO/IEC 9075:1999 standard of 1999 #sql-1999

  SQL:1999 introduced the first of → development/databases/SQL/data-types/collection[two collection types]: the array.

  An amendment to SQL:1999 in 2000 added → development/databases/SQL/select/analytic[window functions]. These were then incorporated into the → #sql-2003 standard.

}
{ SQL:2003 #sql-2003

  SQL:2003 is the ISO/IEC 9075:2003 standard of 2003

 *SQL:2003* introduced the `merge` statement and the second of → development/databases/SQL/data-types/collection[two collection types]: the *multiset*.


}
{ SQL:2006

  SQL:2006 is the ISO/IEC 9075:2006 standard of 2006

}
{ SQL:2008

  SQL:2008 is the ISO/IEC 9075:2008 standard of 2008

 *SQL:2008* enhanced the `merge` statement.

  SQL:2008 specifies 164 mandatory and 280 optional features.

}
{ SQL:2011 #sql-2011

  SQL:2011 is the ISO/IEC 9075:2011 standard of 2011

  SQL:2011 added 34 new features to the SQL/Foundation part (all of which are optional). This brought the total of features in SQL/Foundation to 314.

  The possibly most important feature of *SQL:2011* is the support for → development/databases/SQL/temporal-data[temporal databases]. Other important features that come with *SQL:2011* are
    • `delete` in the `merge` statement.
    • Pipelined → development/databases/SQL/DML[DML]
    • Enhanced `call` statement (*named arguments* and *default values for arguments*)  
    • Ability to limit fetches (See → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/first-n-rows)
    • Enhanced collection types
    • Non-enforced table constraints
    • Window enhancement (→ development/databases/SQL/select/analytic/ntile[`ntile`], navigation within a window (`lag`, `lead`, `nth_value`, `first` and `last`), nested navigation within a window, `groups` option)

{ Parts of the standard #sql-standard-parts

  The → development/databases/SQL[SQL] standard is published in multiple volumes. Currently, these volumes are 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14. (Gaps because some parts were withrdrawn in
  earlier versions of the sandards and their numbers are not recycled).

  
  The parts are
    • 1: Framework
    • 2: Foundation
    • 3: Call-Level Interface (CLI)
    • 4: Persistent Stored Modules (PSM)
    • 9: Management of External Data (MED)
    • 10: Object Language Bindings (OLB)
    • 11: Information and Definition Schemas (Schemata)
    • 13: SQL Routines and Types using the Java Programming Language (JRT)
    • 14: → development/XML[XML]-Related Specification


  { Part 2

     The largest and most importand part is part 2: *foundations*. In SQL:2011, it had 1470 pages.

     It covers
       • → development/databases/SQL/data-types[Data types]
       • → development/databases/SQL/DDL
       • Querying: → development/databases/SQL/select[`select`], `join` etc.
       • → development/databases/SQL/DML: `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `merge` …
       • Access Control: `grant`, `revoke`
       • → development/databases/SQL/transaction[Transaction] control: `commit`, `rollback`, …
       • Connection management: `connect`, `disconnect`
       • Session management: `set session`
       • Exception handling: `get diagnostics`

  }

}
{ Mandatory and optional features

  The SQL standard covers a *list of features* which are put into one of
    • mandatory
    • optional

  These features are listed in Annex F of each part of the standard.

  An SQL implementation is called *conformant* if it implements all mandatory features.
  -
  It might add any optional feature.

  Features seem to be numbered with `(F|S|T)\d\d\d` (for example `F314` is *merge statement with DELETE branch*.

{ Not freely publicly available

  ISO and/or(?) IEC only publishes the *informative sections* of the standard publicly and freely. The rest needs to be purchased.
