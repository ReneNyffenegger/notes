$ SQL Standard feature F383: Set column not null clause
@ F383

By default, each → development/databases/SQL/data-types[SQL data type] allows to be assigned the
→ development/databases/SQL/data-types/null[null value]. The SQL feature F383 specifies that a (table) column can be specified as `not null` so that is impossible to insert a record with a null value in that
column into the table.
