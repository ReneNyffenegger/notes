$ ISO 8601

*ISO 8601* is a widely and internationally accepted standard for the language independent representation of time and date related data, generally in the Gregorian calendar.

Two main features of ISO 8601 include:
  • Easily readable by humans and easily parsable by computers.
  • Date representation sort in the same order alphabetically and chronically.
  • Support for fractional seconds.

ISO 8601 supersedes the previous ISO standards 2014, 2015, 2711, 3307 and 4031.

{ Date

  `yyyy-mm-dd` (or `yyyymmdd`); `yyyy-mm`; `--mm-dd` (or `--mmdd`).

  { Ordinal date

    `yyyy-ddd` (or `yyyyddd`).

  }

}
{ Time

  `hh:mm:ss.sss` (or `hhmmss.sss`); `hh:mm:ss` (or `hhmmss`); `hh:mm` (or `hhmm`); `hh`.


  Midnight: either `00:00` or `24:00`.

}
{ Combination of date and time

  Dates and time combined with `T` as delimiter: `2011-03-18T18:09:55`.

}
{ Time zones #iso-8601-time-zone

 `±hh:mm` (or `±hhmm`); `±hh`

  If the time is represented in → misc/UTC[UTC], a `Z` is added immediately after the time: `18:21:54Z` or `182154Z`.

  The same moment is for example represented by `18:30Z`, `22:30+04`, `1130-0700` and `15:00-03:30`

}
{ Weeks

  ISO 8601 defines that a week begins on a Monday (not a Sunday!).
  
  A year's first week includes both January 4th and the first Thursday of the Year.
  -
  In other words, if a Year's first Monday falls on January 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the
  preceding days of the January are part of the last week of the preceding
  year.

  Week numbers range from 1 to 53.

}
{ Periods

  ISO 8601 allows also to specify durations and repeating intervals.

  Two specific dates are separated with a slash: `20170828T0123456/20180102T543210`.

  Periods (durations) without a specific start or end date start with a `P`.

}
{ JavaScript

  In → development/languages/JavaScript, the value of a → development/languages/JavaScript/code-snippets/objects/Date[Date object] can be represented in ISO 8601 using the
 `toISOString()` method `new Date().toISOString()`.

}

sa:

  → development/date-time/Unix-time

  → development/web/RFC#rfc-3339[RFC 3339 Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps]

  → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON does not specify a date or time data type, a generally accepted way to transmit dates with JSON is using strings in ISO-8601 format.

  The German standard DIN 5008 specifies typographical rules for German texts written on typewriters.
  -
  ISO 8601 has been adopted as *European Standard EN 28601*.

  format a date or timestamp value as ISO-8601.
