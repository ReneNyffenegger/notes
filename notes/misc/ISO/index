{ Format of standard titles

code {
ISO[/IEC] [/ASTM] [IS] nnnn[-p]:[yyyy] Title
code }

  `nnnn` is the (usually randomly chosen) number of the standard.

  `p` is an optional part number.

  `yyyy` is the year in which the standard was published.

  `Title` describes the standard's subject.

  `/IEC` is included if the standard is the result of the *ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee*).

{ Technical committees (TC) -- ISO/IEC JTC 1 Information Technology

  ISO develops their standards in → https://www.iso.org/technical-committees.html[technical committees] which are identified by *ISO/TC n* where *TC* stands for «technical committee» and *n* is a running number that is increased
  when a new technical committee is formed.

  These technical committees cover about anything imaginable. For example,
  → https://www.iso.org/committee/46482.html[ISO/TC 19] is about *preferred numbers*,
  → https://www.iso.org/committee/48104.html[ISO/TC 37] about *Language and terminology*,
  → https://www.iso.org/committee/48750.html[ISO/TC 46] about *Information and documentation*,
  → https://www.iso.org/committee/49650.html[ISO/TC 68] about *Financial Services*,
  → https://www.iso.org/committee/5915511.html[ISO/TC 299] is about *Robotics*.
  -
  There seems even to be a proposed(?) committee to deal with *sex toys*, → https://www.iso.org/committee/7647858.html[ISO/PC 325]

  { ISO/IEC JTC 1 Information Technology #iso-iec-jtc-1

    I am particularly interested in → https://www.iso.org/committee/45020.html[ISO/IEC JTC 1 (Information Technology)]. The *J* in *JTC* indicates that this is a joint technical committee because it is (jointly) steered by two organizations: ISO
    and IEC (→ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission[International Electrotechnical Commission])

    As of 2020-02-27, JTC 1 has published 3236 standards.

    JTC 1, being a committee itself, is also organized into → https://jtc1info.org/page-3/importance-of-isoiec-jtc-1/[subcommittees (SC), working groups (WG) and advisory groups (AG)], for example
    *JTC 1/AG 3* deals with → development/open-source,
    *JTC 1/WG 11* with *smart cities*,
    *JTC 1/SC 2* with *coded character sets*,
    *JTC 1/SC 22* with *→ development/languages[programming languages], their einvornments and system softwware interfaces*,
    → http://jtc1sc32.org/[JTC 1/SC 32] with *Data management and interchange*.

    Some (all?) of these subcommittes are further divided into working groups. For example *JTC 1/SC 32* into
      • WG 1: eBusiness
      • WG 2: → development/Data/metadata
      • WG 3: → development/databases[database] languages
      • WG 4: → development/databases/SQL Multimedia & Application packages

  { Mirroring of ISO and ANSI

    Apparently, the organization between ISO/IEC and some national standardization organizations is mirrorred, at least partially:
    table { ll
      ISO/IEC ☰ ANSI
      JTC 1 ☰ INCITS (InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards)
      SC 32 ☰ DM 32 (Data Management and Interchange)
      WG 3 ☰  DM 32.2 (Database)
      ? ☰ DM 32.2 Ad Hoc (specific short-term task(s) SQL extensions for property graphs)
    table }

  }
