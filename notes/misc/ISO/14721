$ ISO 14721

ISO 14721 defines the reference model for an open archival information system (OASIS). The text of the standard is identical
to → https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf[CCSDS 650.0-M-2].

{ Data and information

  Among others, this standard attempts at defining → development/Data[data] as
"
  A reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing. Examples of data include
  a sequence of bits, a table of numbers, the characters on a page, the recording of sounds made by a person speaking, or a moon rock specimen.
"

  The standard further contrasts data with *information* which is defined as
"
  Any type of knowledge that can be exchanged. In an exchange, it is represented by data. An example is a string of bits (the data) accompanied by a description of how to interpret the string
  of bits as numbers representing temperature observations measured in degrees Celsius (the Representation Information).
