{ Finding addresses of Windows functions

  Executing a Windows function is more complicated than executing a → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[syscall] in → Linux because Linux syscalls are simply numbered.
  -
  However, on Windows, in order to execute a Windows function, one must first load the DLL that contains the function and then determine the address of the function
  wihtin this DLL.

  One DLL that is loaded for all processes is *kernel32.dll`. This DLL exhibits the functions that are needed to determine function addresses: `LoadLibrary` and
  `GetProcAddress`. The addresses of these functions are stored in the *Process Environment Block* (PEB).
