$ Windows architecture

{ Portability

  On of the design goals of Windows NT was portability.

  This goal is mainly achieved by sepearting the functionality that is → hardware/[hardware] dependent from the functionality that is hardware independent.
  -
  Hardware *dependent* functionality is placed into the → Windows/architecture/HAL[Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)] which is implemented in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/hal_dll[`hal.dll`]
  -
  The independent functionality is placed into the kernel and is implemented in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ntoskrnl_exe[`ntoskrnl.exe`].

  In order to have a portable code base, most of `ntoskrnl.exe` was written in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C or C++].
