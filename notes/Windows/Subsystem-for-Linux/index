$ Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

The WSL was introduced in 2016. It promises to run *unmodified* → Linux[Linux] binaries in → Windows/versions/10[Windows 10].

{ WSL versions

  As of this writing there are two WSL versions: *WSL 1* and *WSL 2*.

  WSL 2 has the following three features that are not present in WSL 1:
    • Managed VM (Virtual Machine)
    • Full → Linux/kernel[Linux kernel]
    • Full → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[system calls]
  On the other hand, WSL 2 lacks *Performance across OS file systems*.

  Generally, Microsoft recommends to use WSL 2 if possible. However, accessing the Windows file system from WSL 2 is slower than if accessed from WSL 1.

{ Enabling WSL in a console

  WSL (Version 1?) is enabled in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] with
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe[dism] /online /enable-Feature /featureName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
code }

  In → Windows/PowerShell, it can be enabled with
code {
C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/enable[enable-WindowsOptionalFeature] -online -featureName microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
code }

}
{ Distribution

? After the Subsystem for Linux is installed, a distribution needs to be chosen:
code {
C:\Users\Rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bash_exe[bash]
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the → Microsoft/Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
code }

}
{ Update WSL 1 to WSL 2

  In order to be able to use WSL 2, the *Virtual Machine Platform* → Windows/optional-features[optional feature]:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-defult-version 2
Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the → hardware/BIOS
For information please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2-install
code }

  The *Virtual Machine Platform* can be enabled like so (with elevated privileges):
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe[dism] /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
code }


}
{ TODO

  { Developer mode

    It seems that → Windows/development/developer-mode[developer mode] was needed (but is not anymore) to enable the WSL.

  }
  { wsl.exe

    `wsl.exe` apparently allows to *run → Linux[Linux] binaries* from the Windows Command Prompt (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe], → Windows/PowerShell):
code {
C:\> wsl → Linux/shell/commands/ls[ls -l]
code }

 }

}

sa:

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/lxss[`%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\lxss`]

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wslapi_dll[`wslapi.dll`]
