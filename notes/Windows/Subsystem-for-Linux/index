$ Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
@ Windows Subsystem for Linux

WSL was introduced in 2016. It promises to run *unmodified* → Linux binaries in → Windows/versions/10[Windows 10]. (And with
→ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/release-notes#build-14951[Build 14951], it is also possible to run Windows executables
from a WSL distribution).

{ WSL versions

  As of this writing, there are two WSL versions: *WSL 1* and *WSL 2*.

  WSL 2 has the following three features that are not present in WSL 1:
    • Managed VM (Virtual Machine)
    • Full → Linux/kernel[Linux kernel]
    • Full → #wsl-syscall[system calls]
  On the other hand, WSL 2 lacks *Performance across OS file systems*.

  Generally, Microsoft recommends to use WSL 2 if possible. However, accessing the Windows file system from WSL 2 is slower than if accessed from WSL 1.

  The default version can be set (here to 2) with:
code {
c:> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
code }

}
{ WSLg #wslg

  WSLg is the abbreviation for → https://github.com/microsoft/wslg[Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI]. This component enables GUI applications in WSL. The fundament of WSLg is the *Weston compositor*.

  Audio (in and out) is supported by a *PulseAudio* server.
  

  { WSLGd

   `WSLGd` is the first process launched after `init`. This process is similar to a daemon and
      • starts *Weston* (with XWayland) and *PulseAudio* and
      • then launces `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mstsc_exe` on the host in silend mode in order to establish an RDP connection.

    There seems to be no visible process or an executable (binary) with this name.

  }
  { System Distro

    The → https://github.com/microsoft/wslg#wslg-system-distro[WSLg System Distro] is a containerized Linux environment based on → Linux/distributions/CBL-Mariner.
    where the following components are running.
    table { ll
       ☰ ~Env var~
      WSLg XServer ☰ `$DISPLAY`
      Wayland server ☰ `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
      PulseAudio server ☰ `$PULSE_SERVER`
    table }

{ Enabling WSL in a Windows console

  WSL must be specifically enabled before it can be started. It's possible to enable WSL from the command line with elevated privileges. In order for the enabling to take effect,
  the computer needs to be restarted.

  WSL (Version 1?) is enabled `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe` with
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe[dism] /online /enable-Feature /featureName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
code }

  In → Windows/PowerShell, it can be enabled with
code {
PS:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/enable[enable-WindowsOptionalFeature] -online -featureName microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
code }

}
{ Distribution(s)

? After the Subsystem for Linux is installed, a distribution needs to be chosen:
code {
C:\Users\Rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bash_exe[bash]
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the → Microsoft/Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
code }

  { Finding distributions #wsl-l-o

    Distributions that are available from the *online store* can be listed like so:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --list --online
The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.
The default distribution is denoted by '*'.
Install using 'wsl --install -d <Distro>'.

  { Install distro

code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --install --distribution Debian
code }

   { WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x800701bc

    *2023-05-18* on a new laptop, when trying to install Debian, I received the error *0x800701bc* along with a link to → https://aka.ms./wsl2kernel where I could find more information.

     This link told me to → #wsl-linux-kernel-update[install the Linux kernel update].

   }
   { WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80370102

     Still on the *2023-05-18* on a new laptop after updating the kernel, I got the *0x800701bc* error along with a link to → https://aka.ms./enablevirtualization.

     This link suggested to enable hypervisor launch in the boot configuration with `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bcdedit_exe`:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bcdedit_exe[bcdedit] /set hypervisorlaunchtype Auto
code }

     However, even after rebooting the system and verifying that virtualization was enabled in the BIOS, this didn't work.

     The next attempt was to enable *VirtualMachinePlatform* (which then seemed to finally work!)
code {
PS:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/enable[enable-WindowsOptionalFeature] -online -featureName VirtualMachinePlatform -all
code }
 

   }
   { Old attempts

  (*The following describes an unsuccessful attempt of mine to install a distribution*).

    Download links for the distros can be found → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual[here] and → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[here].

    The distributions are stored in `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Packages/WSL-distro`

  }


}
{ Update WSL 1 to WSL 2

  In order to be able to use WSL 2, the *Virtual Machine Platform* → Windows/optional-features[optional feature] must be enabled:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the → hardware/BIOS
For information please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2-install
code }

  The *Virtual Machine Platform* can be enabled like so (with elevated privileges):
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe[dism] /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
code }

  However, I still receive an error:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
Error: 0x1bc
For information on key differences with WSL 2 please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2
code }

  → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5651[This thread] seems to contain some information on how to get around this issue. It is suggested that the kernel needs to be installed into
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/lxss/tools[`C:\Windows\System32\lxss\tools`].
  -
  I was able to to that by → #wsl-linux-kernel-update[updating the Linux kernel].

  Installing (updating) the kernel seemed to work, setting the default version to 2 works now:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
For information on key differences with WSL 2 please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2

C:\users\rene> debian config --default-user rene
code }

  Replace `debian` with the name of the distro for which the password needs to be reset.

}
{ Starting a distribution

  The parameter `-d` of `wsl` specifies the distribution to be started. (The distribution must have been installed beforehand)
code {
C:> wsl -d Debian
code }

  Alternatively, a distribution can be started like so:
code {
C:\> kali
code }

}
{ Accessing the «other» filesystem

  { DrvFS

    → https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/wsl/wsl-file-system-support#drvfs[DrvFs] is a filesystem that allows WSL to mount NTFS and ReFS volumes.

    DrvFS provides the following → Linux/shell/commands/mount#mount-options[mount options]:
    table { ll
      `uid` ☰ User ID of the owner of the mounted files.
      `gid` ☰ Group ID of the group-owner of the mounted files. 
      `umask` ☰ 
      `fmask` ☰
      `dmask` ☰
      `metadata` ☰ If set, Linux file permissions are stored in metadata of mounted files
      `case` ☰ Case sensitivity of directory(?) names
    table }

  }
  { Accessing the Windows Filesystem from WSL

    With DrvFS, a Windows drive is (typically) mounted to `/mnt/<drive>` (the root of the default mount path can be changed with the `root` setting under `[automount]` in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/wsl_conf`):
code {
$ ls → Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/c
$ ls → Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/d
…
code }

    A newly plugged in external harddisk can be mounted within WSL like so. The following example assumes that the mounted files need to be accessible by the user whose id is 1000 and corresponding group id is also 1000:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo mkdir /mnt/e
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/shell/commands/mount -t drvfs E: /mnt/e -o uid=1000,gid=1000,fmask=133,dmask=022
code }

    TODO: Should the → Linux/shell/commands/mount#mount-options[mount options] (specified with `-o`) be
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/shell/commands/mount -t drvfs E: /mnt/e -o uid=1000,gid=1000,fmask=177,dmask=077
code }

  }
  { Accessing WSL Filesystem from Windows

    In the explorer, the installed WSL filesystem can be accessed via `\\wsl$\…` or `\\wsl.localhost\…`.

    It's thus possible to map a network drive to a running WSL instance:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe/use L: \\wsl$\Debian
The command completed successfully.

C:\> L:
L:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/dir
…
2020-09-03  01:56 AM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/bin[bin]
2020-07-10  11:04 PM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/boot[boot]
2022-06-01  12:41 AM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/dev[dev]
2022-06-01  12:30 AM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/etc[etc]
…
L:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/cd etc
L:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/notepad_exe[notepad] → Linux/fhs/etc/wsl_conf[wsl.conf]
code }

    This mapping is possible because WSL runs a → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P_%28protocol%29[9P protocol] file server which Windows uses as a client (See for example the output of
   `→ Linux/shell/commands/dmesg | → Linux/shell/commands/grep 9p`).
    -
    The communication between WSL and Windows runs over AF_UNIX sockets.

  }
}
{ Accessing an USB device #wsl-usb

  WSL → https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb[cannot natively access a USB device], but (with WSL 2 only?), it's possible with → https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win[usbipd-win].
  
  In order to be able to mount an USB device, the kernel must be → #wsl-compile-kernel[compiled] with *Mass USB* enabled (by setting config optition `CONFIG_USB_STORAGE` to `y`)
  because → https://youtu.be/I2jOuLU4o8E[the default WSL kernel also does not have support for USB storage device].

  usbipd-win can be installed with the following command line (which requires elevated privileges at one point)
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/winget_exe[winget] install usbipd
code }

  usbipd comes with
    • A → Windows/services called *usbipd* (display name: *USBIP Device Host*).
    • A command line tool, also named → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/usbipd-win#usbipd-exe[`usbipd`]. The location of this tool (`→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/usbipd-win`) will be added to the `→ Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH` environment variable.
    • A firewall rule, again called usbipd, to allow all local subnets to connect to the service. This firewall rule can be modified to fine tune access control.  (If using a third-party firewall, you may have to reconfigure it to allow incoming connections on TCP port 3240.)

  On the WSL guest, `→ Linux/shell/commands/usbip` must be installed (for example when running Debian or Ubuntu):
code {
$ sudo apt install -y usbip usbutils hwdata
code }

  Then, list the USB devices attached to the host:
code {
C:\> usbipd wsl list
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
1-3    abcd:1234  USB-Massenspeichergerät                                       Not attached
1-8    04f2:b67c  Integrated Camera, Integrated IR Camera                       Not attached

C:> usbipd wsl attach --busid=1-3
code }

  Note: `usbipd wsl attach` requires elevated privileges.
  
  Now, in WSL:
code {
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID abcd:1234 LogiLink UDisk flash drive                         <<<< this one was added
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
code }

}
{ Interoperability #wsl-interoperability

  Interoperability allows to execute Windows and Linux binaries from both, a Windows command terminal or a Linux shell.

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe` allows to *run → Linux[Linux] binaries* from the Windows Command Prompt (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe], → Windows/PowerShell):
code {
C:\> wsl → Linux/shell/commands/ls -l
code }

    Thus, it is possible, for example, to update a WSL distribution when being in Windows:
code {
C:\> wsl → Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/APT/commands/apt-get update
code }

  The output of a Linux command executed via WSL can be piped to a Windows binary:
code {
C:\> wsl → Linux/shell/commands/ls -1 | → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[findstr] /i xyz
code }

  On the other hand, it is also possible to execute Windows bineries from WSL:
code {
$ → Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/c/Windows/→ Windows/dirs/Windows/explorer_exe
code }

  Interoperability can be enabled/or disabled:
code {
echo 0 > → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
…
echo 1 > → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
code }

  DriveFS is a → #wsl-file-system[file system] that makes interoperability possible.

}
{ Environment variables

  Some aspects of WSL are controlled by a few → development/environment-variable[environment variables].

  { $WSL_DISTRO_NAME

    A shell started with `wsl` defines the environment variable `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME` whose value corresponds
    to the running Linux distribution.

    For example, when stared in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`]:
code {
C:\> wsl -d kali-linux -- echo $WSL_DISTRO_NAME
kali-linux
code }

  Or in → Windows/PowerShell (note the backtick to escape the special meaning of the dollar symbol in PowerShell):
code {
PS C:\> wsl -d Debian -- echo `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME
Debian
code }

  }
  { $WSL_INTEROP #WSL_INTEROP

    See `→ Linux/fhs/run/WSL`

  }
  { $WSLENV

   `WSLENV` controls how (other) environment variables flow between WSL and Win32.

  }
  { PULSE_SERVER

    The value of `PULSE_SERVER` is `→ Linux/fhs/mnt/wslg/PulseServer`.

  }

}
{ Registry

  Some information about the WSL installation is stored in the → Windows/registry under the keys:
    • `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Lxss` (where a WSL distribution can be renamed)
    • `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Lxss`
    • `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P9NP`

}
{ Compile a new Kernel #wsl-compile-kernel

code {
$ → development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone[git clone] → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel
$ cd WSL2-Linux-Kernel/
$ cp → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/blob/master/Microsoft/config-wsl[Microsoft/config-wsl] → Linux/kernel/source/_config
code }

  When I tried to build the Kernel (version WSL 5.15) with the copied `.config` file, → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/10299[I encountered] the error message: *FAILED: load BTF from vmlinux: No such file or directory*.
  -
  I could solve this by commenting the config option `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` in the `.config` file.

  In order to be able to → #wsl-usb[mount an USB device], the config option `CONFIG_USB_STORAGE` must be set to `y`.

  With at least the `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` change in the `.config` file, the Kernel can be built with
code {
$ → development/make -j4
code }

  The new Kernel can then be copied to the WSL host:
code {
$ WINUSER=Rene
$ cp arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage /mnt/c/Users/$WINUSER/
code }

  It's necessary to tell the host where the new Kernel is located:
code {
$ cat "[wsl2]
kernel=C:\\\\Users\\\\$WINUSER\\\\bzImage
" > → Windows/dirs/Users/username/_wslconfig[/mnt/c/Users/$WINUSER/.wslconfig]
code }

  Finally, the new kernel can be started by shutting down and restarting wsl:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --shutdown
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl]
code }

  { TODO: Alternative building commands

    As per an answer I got on this → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/10299[issue], the kernel can alternatively be built with
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt install -y build-essential flex bison dwarves libssl-dev libelf-dev bc
$ make KCONFIG_CONFIG=Microsoft/config-wsl
code }

  }

}
{ Misc

  `→ Linux/fhs/etc/hosts` inherits the entries from → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts[`%windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`].

code {
$ wslpath C:/Users/Rene

$ wslpath -w /mnt/c/Users/Rene/
C:\Users\Rene

$ wslpath -m /mnt/c/Users/Rene/

    At least when Debian is installed, fonts are crappy.

code {

code }

    Installing fontos-noto improved fonts in Chrome's URL bar, but Monospace in → development/vim[gvim] was unreadable and Chrome wouldn't display monospace fonts correctly.

    I could solve the monospace font problem in Chrome by going to `chrome://settings/fonts` and then scrolling down to *Fixed-width font* and replacing *Monospace* with *Liberation Mono*.

    { Attempt two

      In a WSL 2 Debian installation, I had sound in Chrome, but when trying use a → Kunst/Musik/Csound frontend (`blue`, `csoundqt`), these were mute. `csoundqt` issued this error message
     *PortAudio V19.6.0-devel, …   error: No sound device is available … closing device* and *Failed to initialize real time audio output*.

      After installing the following package and restarting the WSL distro, I had sound for both, Chrome and csound frontends:
code {
sudo apt-get install libasound-dev
code }

    }

  { System Calls (syscalls) #wsl-syscall

    All → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[(Linux) System Calls] are → https://needleinathreadstack.wordpress.com/2017/01/20/windows-subystem-for-linux-file-reads/[fullfilled by a pico provider].

    { lxcore.sys / lxss.sys

    ? This provider is implemented by `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/lxss_sys` and `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/lxcore_sys`: they coordinate such syscall requests with the Windows NT Kernel.

      When the NT Kernel is called with a syscall, the kernel checks if the call came from a *pico process* by checking the state in the process structure (I assume that to be a special flag).
      -
      If this is the case, the kernel saves the register state and «forwards» the call to the *pico driver*. The pico driver then finds the Linux syscall number in the `RAX` register and acts accordingly.
      -
      After having serviced the request, the calling flow is returned to the NT kernel which restores the register state and puts the return value into the `RAX` register.
      -
      Finally, the execution is returned to the WSL process.
    
      A syscall is forwarded to `lxcore.sys` (or `lxss.sys`?) which either (preferrably) dispatches it to an NT syscall or handles it itself.
      -
      An example of a nice mapping between a Linux and NT syscall is `sched_yield()` and `ZwYieldExecution()`.
      -
      On the other hand, `fork()` has no direct equivlent on NT. Therfore, when `lxcore.sys` (or `lxss.sys`?) handles a `fork()` call,
      it prepares the copying of the process, then calls the NT syscall to create a process and finally finishes the copying.

  { File Systems #wsl-file-system

    WSL comes with two file systems:
    table { ll
      VolFS ☰ Cannot be used for → #wsl-interoperability[interoperability]. Provides most features of → Linux/filesystem/virtual[Linux VFS]: permissions, sym-links, FIFOs, sockets and device files. VolFS is used to mount the root file system to `/`.
      DriveFS ☰ Used for → #wsl-interoperability[interoperability]. File names are required to be valid Windows file names and are case insensitive. Windows drives (`C:\` etc.) are mounted to `→ Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/c` etc.).
    table }

  }
  { \Device\lxss

    WSL creates the *device object* (→ Windows/kernel/objects[kernel object]?) `\Device\lxss`, verify with `→ Windows/tools/Sysinternals/Winobj`

  }
  { CreateLxProcess

   `CreateLxProcess()` is → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/wsl/windows-and-ubuntu-interoperability[apparently] a COM method to talk to the *LXSS Manager service*.

    This method is used by `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bash_exe`.

  }
  { LxBus

   *LxBus* provides a channel, based on sockets, on which NT and WSL processes can communicate by exchanging messages and sharing state.

    This channel is primarily used by the *LXSS Manager service* (NT) and `/init` (WSL).

    LxBus is accessed (from the WSL) side by opending the `→ Linux/fhs/dev[/dev]/lxss` device (which is not shown with `ls /dev/lxss`). `/dev/lxssclient` supports a subset of `/dev/lxss`.

  }
  { /init #wsl-init

   `/init` is mapped from `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/lxss/tools/init` which can be demonstrated like so:
code {
$ diff  /init  /mnt/c/Windows/System32/lxss/tools/init
code }

  }
