$ Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
@ Windows Subsystem for Linux

The WSL was introduced in 2016. It promises to run *unmodified* → Linux[Linux] binaries in → Windows/versions/10[Windows 10]. (And with
→ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/release-notes#build-14951[Build 14951], it is also possible to run Windows executables
from a WSL distribution).

{ WSL versions

  As of this writing there are two WSL versions: *WSL 1* and *WSL 2*.

  WSL 2 has the following three features that are not present in WSL 1:
    • Managed VM (Virtual Machine)
    • Full → Linux/kernel[Linux kernel]
    • Full → #wsl-syscall[system calls]
  On the other hand, WSL 2 lacks *Performance across OS file systems*.

  Generally, Microsoft recommends to use WSL 2 if possible. However, accessing the Windows file system from WSL 2 is slower than if accessed from WSL 1.

}
{ Enabling WSL in a console

  WSL (Version 1?) is enabled in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] with
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe[dism] /online /enable-Feature /featureName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
code }

  In → Windows/PowerShell, it can be enabled with
code {
C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/enable[enable-WindowsOptionalFeature] -online -featureName microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
code }

}
{ Distribution(s)

? After the Subsystem for Linux is installed, a distribution needs to be chosen:
code {
C:\Users\Rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bash_exe[bash]
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the → Microsoft/Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
code }

  { Finding distributions

    Distributions that are available from the *online store* can be listed like so:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --list --online
code }

  }
  { Install distro

code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --install --distribution Debian
code }

   { Old attempts

  (*The following describes an unsuccessful attempt of mine to install a distribution*).

    Download links for the distros can be found → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual[here] and → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[here].

code {
    $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'   ## Does this make the download time shorter???
rem invoke-webRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1604    -outFile Ubuntu.appx -useBasicParsing
    invoke-webRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wsl-kali-linux-new -outFile kali.appx   -useBasicParsing

    add-→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/appxPackage[appxPackage] .\kali.appx
code }

  Unfortunately, even after executing `add-appxPackage …`, there is no distribution installed:
code {
C:\Users\Rene> wsl
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the Microsoft Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
code }

    }
  }
  { Removing a distro

code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --unregister <distro name>
code }

  }
  { Location

    The distributions are stored in `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Packages/WSL-distro`

  }

}
{ Update WSL 1 to WSL 2

  In order to be able to use WSL 2, the *Virtual Machine Platform* → Windows/optional-features[optional feature] must be enabled:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the → hardware/BIOS
For information please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2-install
code }

  The *Virtual Machine Platform* can be enabled like so (with elevated privileges):
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe[dism] /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
code }

  However, I still receive an error:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
Error: 0x1bc
For information on key differences with WSL 2 please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2
code }

  → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5651[This thread] seems to contain some information on how to get around this issue. It is suggested that the kernel needs to be installed into
  ­ → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/lxss/tools[`C:\Windows\System32\lxss\tools`]:
code {
rem → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/webRequest/invoke[invoke-webRequest] -uri → https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi -outFile WSLUpdate.msi -useBasicParsing
    → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/webRequest/invoke[invoke-webRequest] -uri → https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi                        -useBasicParsing
rem → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msiexec_exe[msiexec] /package WSLUpdate.msi     /quiet
    → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msiexec_exe[msiexec] /package wsl_upate_x64.msi /quiet
code }

  Installing the kernel seemed to work, setting the default version to 2 works now:
code {
C:\users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
For information on key differences with WSL 2 please visit → https://aka.ms/wsl2
code }


}
{ Reset password

  In Windows (not Linux!) command line
code {
C:\users\rene> debian config --default-user root
C:\users\rene> debian
root@DESKTOP-1SDJMCL:~# passwd rene
…
root@DESKTOP-1SDJMCL:~# exit
C:\users\rene> debian config --default-user rene
code }

  Replace `debian` with the name of the distro for which the password needs to be reset.

}
{ Starting a distribution

  The parameter `-d` of `wsl` specifies the distribution to be started. (The distribution must have been installed beforehand)
code {
C:> wsl -d Debian
code }

  Alternatively, a distribution can be started like so:
code {
C:\> kali
code }

}
{ Accessing WSL Filesystem from Windows

  It's possible to map a network drive to a started WSL distribution:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/net_exe/use L: \\wsl$\Debian
The command completed successfully.

C:\> L:
L:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/dir
…
2020-09-03  01:56 AM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/bin[bin]
2020-07-10  11:04 PM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/boot[boot]
2022-06-01  12:41 AM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/dev[dev]
2022-06-01  12:30 AM    <DIR>          → Linux/fhs/etc[etc]
…
L:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/cd etc
L:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/notepad_exe[notepad] → Linux/fhs/etc/wsl_conf[wsl.conf]
code }

  This mapping is possible because WSL runs a → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P_%28protocol%29[9P protocol] file server which Windows uses as a client (See for example the output of
 `→ Linux/shell/commands/dmesg | → Linux/shell/commands/grep 9p`).
  -
  The communication between WSL and Windows runs over AF_UNIX sockets.

}
{ Accessing the Windows Filesystem from WSL

  A Windows drive is mounted to `/mnt/<drive>`:
code {
$ ls → Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/c
$ ls → Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/d
…
code }

}
{ Interoperability #wsl-interoperability

  Interoperability allows to execute Windows and Linux binaries from both, a Windows command terminal or a Linux shell.

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[`wsl.exe`] allows to *run → Linux[Linux] binaries* from the Windows Command Prompt (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe], → Windows/PowerShell):
code {
C:\> wsl → Linux/shell/commands/ls[ls -l]
code }

    Thus, it is possible, for example, to update a WSL distribution when being in Windows:
code {
C:\> wsl Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/APT/commands/apt-get update
code }

  On the other hand, it is also possible to execute Windows bineries from WSL:
code {
$ → Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/c/Windows/→ Windows/dirs/Windows/explorer_exe
code }

  Interoperability can be enabled/or disabled:
code {
echo 0 > → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
…
echo 1 > → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
code }

  DriveFS is a → #wsl-file-system[file system] that makes interoperability possible.

}
{ Environment variables

  Some aspects of WSL are controlled by a few → development/environment-variable[environment variables].

  { $WSL_DISTRO_NAME

    A shell started with `wsl` defines the environment variable `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`.

    For example, when stared in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`]:
code {
C:\> wsl -d kali-linux -- echo $WSL_DISTRO_NAME
kali-linux
code }

  Or in → Windows/PowerShell (note the backtick to escape the special meaning of the dollar symbol in PowerShell):
code {
PS C:\> wsl -d Debian -- echo `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME
Debian
code }

  }
  { $WSL_INTEROP #WSL_INTEROP

    See `→ Linux/fhs/run/WSL`

  }
  { $WSLENV

   `WSLENV` controls how (other) environment variables flow between WSL and Win32.

  }

}
{ Registry

  Some information about the WSL installation is stored in the → Windows/registry under the keys:
    • → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Lxss[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss`]
    • → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Lxss[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss`]
    • `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\P9NP`

}
{ Misc

  `→ Linux/fhs/etc/hosts` inherits the entries from → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts[`%windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`].


  → Linux/fhs/bin/wslpath[`wslpath`] performs WSL/Windows path conversions:
code {
$ wslpath C:/Users/Rene
/mnt/c/Users/Rene

$ wslpath -w /mnt/c/Users/Rene/
C:\Users\Rene

$ wslpath -m /mnt/c/Users/Rene/
C:/Users/Rene
code }

}
{ TODO

  { Developer mode

    It seems that → Windows/development/developer-mode[developer mode] was needed (but is not anymore) to enable the WSL.

  }
  { Change display language of WSL

code {
$ sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF8
code }

  }
  { Pico Processes #wsl-pico-processes

    → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/wsl/pico-process-overview[Pico Processes] are the foundation of WSL. (See also → Windows#win-DrawBridge[DrawBridge])

  }
  { System Calls (syscalls) #wsl-syscall

    All → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[(Linux) System Calls] are → https://needleinathreadstack.wordpress.com/2017/01/20/windows-subystem-for-linux-file-reads/[fullfilled by a pico provider].

    { lxcore.sys / lxss.sys

    ? This provider is implemented by `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/lxss_sys` and `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/lxcore_sys`: they coordinate such syscall requests with the Windows NT Kernel.

      When the NT Kernel is called with a syscall, the kernel checks if the call came from a *pico process* by checking the state in the process structure (I assume that to be a special flag).
      -
      If this is the case, the kernel saves the register state and «forwards» the call to the *pico driver*. The pico driver then finds the Linux syscall number in the `RAX` register and acts accordingly.
      -
      After having serviced the request, the calling flow is returned to the NT kernel which restores the register state and puts the return value into the `RAX` register.
      -
      Finally, the execution is returned to the WSL process.
    
      A syscall is forwarded to `lxcore.sys` (or `lxss.sys`?) which either (preferrably) dispatches it to an NT syscall or handles it itself.
      -
      An example of a nice mapping between a Linux and NT syscall is `sched_yield()` and `ZwYieldExecution()`.
      -
      On the other hand, `fork()` has no direct equivlent on NT. Therfore, when `lxcore.sys` (or `lxss.sys`?) handles a `fork()` call,
      it prepares the copying of the process, then calls the NT syscall to create a process and finally finishes the copying.

      See also the WSL Blog: → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/wsl/wsl-system-calls[WSL System Calls].

    }

  }
  { File Systems #wsl-file-system

    WSL comes with two file systems:
    table { ll
      VolFS ☰ Cannot be used for → #wsl-interoperability[interoperability]. Provides most features of → Linux/filesystem/virtual[Linux VFS]: permissions, sym-links, FIFOs, sockets and device files. VolFS is used to mount the root file system to `/`.
      DriveFS ☰ Used for → #wsl-interoperability[interoperability]. File names are required to be valid Windows file names and are case insensitive. Windows drives (`C:\` etc.) are mounted to `→ Linux/fhs/mnt[/mnt]/c` etc.).
    table }

  }
  { \Device\lxss

    WSL creates the *device object* (→ Windows/kernel/objects[kernel object]?) `\Device\lxss`, verify with `→ Windows/tools/Sysinternals/Winobj`

  }
  { CreateLxProcess

   `CreateLxProcess()` is → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/wsl/windows-and-ubuntu-interoperability[apparently] a COM method to talk to the *LXSS Manager service*.

    This method is used by `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/bash_exe`.

  }
  { LxBus

   *LxBus* provides a channel, based on sockets, on which NT and WSL processes can communicate by exchanging messages and sharing state.

    This channel is primarily used by the *LXSS Manager service* (NT) and `/init` (WSL).

    LxBus is accessed (from the WSL) side by opending the `→ Linux/fhs/dev[/dev]/lxss` device (which is not shown with `ls /dev/lxss`). `/dev/lxssclient` supports a subset of `/dev/lxss`.

  }
  { /init #wsl-init

   `/init` is mapped from `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/lxss/tools/init` which can be demonstrated like so:
code {
$ diff  /init  /mnt/c/Windows/System32/lxss/tools/init
code }

  }
  { WSLg

    WSLg is short for *Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI*.
