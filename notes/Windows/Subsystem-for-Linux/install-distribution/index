$ Installing a WSL Distribution on an external harddisk

Some notes about installing a → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux distribution on an external harddisk. I've found most of the interesting pieces in
→ https://superuser.com/a/1572837/16610[this helpful SuperUser anser].

First, I had to make sure that → Windows/optional-features/Hyper-V was enabled (prevent message *Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.*).
-
In order to also prevent *One or several parent features are disabled so current feature can not be enabled.*, I use the `-all` option in the following command:
code {
enable-windowsOptionalFeature -featureName microsoft-hyper-v -online -all
code }

It should be noted that after enabling Hyper-V, I was unable to start → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox[Oracle VirtualBox] anymore.

Making sure I am running wsl version 2:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --set-default-version 2
code }

Specify the directory to which the → development/filename-extensions#appx[`.appx`] file should be downloaded and the directory (on the external harddsik) where the distribution is to be installed:
code {
$downloadDir = $env:temp
$destDir     = 'd:/wsl/debian'
code }

I want to install → Linux/distributions/Debian. A list of available download links is → https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distributions[here].
code {
$appxUrl = 'https://aka.ms/wsl-debian-gnulinux'

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/preference/progressPreference = 'silentlyContinue'
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/webRequest/invoke $appxUrl -outFile $downloadDir/linux.appx -useBasicParsing
code }

Uncompress the downloaded appx file (which is a → development/archive-files/zip[zip file] in disguise):
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/move[mv] ./linux.appx ./linux.zip
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/archive/expand ./linux.zip
code }


The extracted files contain «nested» appx's. Running a x64 system (as opposed to an ARM system), I extract the corresponding appx:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/move[mv] DistroLauncher-Appx_1.12.2.0_x64.appx x64.zip
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/archive/expand x64.zip
code }

The extracted files are moved to the hardddisk:
code {
cd x64
mv * $destDir
code }

I am finally able to install the distribution:
code {
cd $destDir
./debian
code }
