Chocolatey is a *package manager* for → Windows.

Chocolatey is built on top of the nuget command line and nuget infrastructure.

{ Installing Chocolatey #chocolatey-install

  In → Windows/PowerShell, with Adminstrator privileges, chocolatey can be installed like so:
code {
$ua = → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new[new-object] → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Net/WebClient[System.Net.WebClient]
$installScript = $ua.DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/expression/invoke[invoke-expression] $installScript
code }

  After installing Chocolatey, its executables are found in the directory → Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin[`%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin`].
  This path is added to the → Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[`PATH` environment variable] by the downloaded `install.ps1` script.

  TODO: the installation also seems to add the followig snippet to the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/profile[profile]:
code {
# Chocolatey profile
$ChocolateyProfile = "$env:ChocolateyInstall\helpers\chocolateyProfile.psm1"
if (Test-Path($ChocolateyProfile)) {
  Import-Module "$ChocolateyProfile"
}
code }

}

{ Update the entire system

code {
choco upgrade all -y
code }

}
{ Misc / TODO

  { Environment variable ChocolateyLastPathUpdate #env-var-ChocolateyLastPathUpdate

    With Chocolatey, there also comes the → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variable] `ChocolateyLastPathUpdate`.

  }
