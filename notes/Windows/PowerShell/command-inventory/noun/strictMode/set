$ PowerShell cmdLet set-strictMode

`set-strictMode` is used to check the validity of expressions etc.

`set-strictMode` is set to a *version* (with `latest` referring to the most recent one):
code {
set-strictMode -version 2
set-strictMode -version latest
code }

The effect of `set-strictMode` only extends the scope (and child scopes) in which it is set.

{ -version

  The `-version` argument takes one of the following four arguments
  table { ll
    `1.0` ☰ prohibits references to uninitialized variables, except for uninitialized variables in strings.
    `2.0` ☰ `1.0` *plus* prohibiting references to non-existent properties of an objects and prohibiting function calls that use the syntax for calling methods.
    `3.0` ☰ `2.0` *plus* prohibiting  out of bounds or unresolvable array indexes.
    `latest` ☰ Latest version that is available
  table }

}
{ Using set-strictMode and param statement

  With a few exceptions, the → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters#ps-parameters-param-stmt[`param` statement] must be the first statement in a PowerShell script. Therefore, the `set-strictMode` must be placed
  after the `param` statement.
