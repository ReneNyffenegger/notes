{ List files that were modified in the last 24 hours

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline shows files (not directories) that were modified during the last 24 hours.

  The → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/forEach[`forEach-object`] part is required to transform the returned objects into strings.

code {
get-childItem -recurse -attributes !directory | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/where[where-object] { → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/psItem[$_].lastWriteTime → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison[-gt] (→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/date/get[get-date]).addDays(-1) } | forEach-object { $_.directoryName + '\' + $_.name }
code }

}
{ Sort files and directories according to modification time

  The equivalent of → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/dir#cmd-exe-dir-sort[cmd.exe's `dir /od`], which sorts files according to their modification date time, in PowerShell is
code {
get-childItem | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/sort[sort-object] { $_.lastWriteTime }
code }

}

  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem
