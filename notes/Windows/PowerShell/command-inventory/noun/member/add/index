$ PowerShell cmdLet add-member

`add-member` allows to add member variables and methods to a → Windows/PowerShell object.

{ Basic demonstration of add-member

  The following simple example of add-member creates a `System.Object` object and adds the two member variables `num` and `text`.
  It also adds the member method `twice` which multiplies the value of `num` and assigns it to `num` again.

  After → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new[creating the object with `new-object`] and creating the members, the method `twice()` is called. Then, the
  object is → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/output/write[printed with `write-output`] to verify that the value of `num` has doubled indeed:
