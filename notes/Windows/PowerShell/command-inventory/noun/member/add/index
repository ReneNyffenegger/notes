$ PowerShell cmdLet add-member

`add-member` allows to add member variables and methods to a → Windows/PowerShell object.

When adding a member method, within the added code, the special variable → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/this[`$this`] refers to the object.

{ -memberType parameter #add-member-memberType

  There are different types of members that can be added to an object. The `-memberType` parameter of `add-member` is used to specify the type of the member that is added to an object.

  The possible member types that can be added is a subset of those that are found in the
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSMemberTypes[`System.Management.Automation.PSMemberTypes`] enum:
     • `noteProperty`
     • `aliasProperty`
     • `scriptProperty`
     • `codeProperty`
     • `scriptMethod`
     • `codeMethod`


}
{ Basic demonstration of add-member

  The following simple example of add-member creates a `System.Object` object and adds the two member variables `num` and `text`.
  It also adds the member method `twice` which multiplies the value of `num` and assigns it to `num` again.

  After → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new[creating the object with `new-object`] and creating the members, the method `twice()` is called. Then, the
  object is → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/output/write[printed with `write-output`] to verify that the value of `num` has doubled indeed:

{ Adding a script method #add-member-script-method

  A script method adds member methods to an object. Within the script block that implements the method, the respective → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[object] can be referred to
  with the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/this[`$this` automatic variable].
