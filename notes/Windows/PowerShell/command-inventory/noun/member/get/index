$ PowerShell cmdLet get-member

`get-member $obj` returns a list of → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Microsoft/PowerShell/Commands/MemberDefinition[`Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.MemberDefinition`] objects that describe the members of the
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/object[PowerShell object] `$obj`: its properties, methods, script methods and events.

Usually, an object is → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[piped] into the `get-member` cmdLet:
code {
$obj | get-member
code }

However, it is also possible to explicitely state the input object:
code {
get-member -inputObject $obj
code }

`get-member` won't return properties that are *hidden*.

{ -memberType #ps-get-member-memberType

  The option `-memberType` specifies the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSMemberTypes[types of members] to be displayed.

}
{ -force #ps-get-member-force

  With `-force`, the cmdLet also returns the the → Windows/PowerShell/language/object#psobject-intrinsic-members[object's intrinsic members] and its `get_` and `set_` methods.

}
