$ PowerShell cmdLet split-path

The `split-path` cmdLet allows to select parts such as directories, filenames or extensions from a path.

Unlike → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/path/resolve[`resolve-path`], `split-path` also returns a value if the specified path does not point to an existing directory or file.

The type of the returned value is a string. Its value depends on the option that is passed to `split-path`.
-
Specifying `drive:\dirOne\dirTwo\file.ext`, the following parts of the path are returned:
table { lll
  ~Option used~  ☰ ~Returned value~ ☰ ~Comment~
                 ☰ `drive:\dirOne\dirTwo` ☰ The directory in which a file is located, or a directory's parent directory
  `-parent`      ☰ `drive:\dirOne\dirTwo` ☰ Requires PowerShell 6 or later
  `-leaf`        ☰ `file.ext` ☰
  `-leafBase`    ☰ `file` ☰
  `-extension`   ☰ `.ext` ☰ Requires PowerShell 6 or later
  `-qualifier`   ☰ `drive:` ☰
  `-noQualifier` ☰ `\dirOne\dirTwo\file.ext` ☰
  `-isAbsolute`  ☰ `→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/true-false[$true]` ☰ Compare with the static method → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/Path/IsPathRooted[`IsPathRooted()`] of the .NET class → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/Path[`System.IO.Path`]
table }
