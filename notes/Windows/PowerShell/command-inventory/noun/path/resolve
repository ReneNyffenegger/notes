$ PowerShell cmdLet resolve-path

If invoked without the `-relative` option, `resolve-path` returns on or more → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PathInfo[`System.Management.Automation.PathInfo`] objects with
the → Windows/PowerShell/language/wildcards[wildcard] characters expanded.

  Return a list of all files with 4 characters in the filename (without → development/filename-extensions[extension]) and the extension `.txt`:
code {
resolve-path ????.txt
code }

  Return a list of all `.tmp` files that start with `a`:
code {
resolve-path a*.tmp
code }

  Return the *home directory*
code {
resolve-path ~
code }

{ -relative

  With the option `-relative` specified, `resolve-path` returns a list of relative paths (relative to the current directory, that is):
code {
resolve-path ../../*.txt -relative
code }

  The returned data type is not a `PathInfo` object anymore, but a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/String[string].

  { Combining -relative with get-childItem #resolve-path-relative_get-childItem

    The following simple → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipeline] combines → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get[`get-childItem`] and `resolve-path -relative` to return
    a list of all relative path names of `.sql` files beneath the current directory:
code {
get-childItem -recurse -filter *.sql | select-object { resolve-path $_.fullName -relative }
code }

  }
  { Get relative path between an arbitrary directory and file/directory

    The function → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/filesystem/resolve-relativePath[`resolve-relativePath`] (of the → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/filesystem[PowerShell module `filesystem`]) allows to get a relative path from an arbitrary directory
    to a file or directory.

  }

}
{ Files must exist

 `resolve-path` requires real (existing) files to operate. It's not possible (as far as I can see) to use `resolve-path -relative` to find a relative path to a hypothetical file that does not yet
  exist, for example, in order to create its directory:
code {
PS C:\> resolve-path $home\foo\bar\baz.txt
resolve-path : Cannot find path 'C:\Users\Rene\foo\bar\baz.txt' because it does not exist.
code }

  It is possible to circumvent this restriction in PowerShell by using the methods that are exposed via
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PathIntrinsics[`$ExecutionContext.SessionState.Path`].

  The → http://devhawk.net/blog/2010/1/22[DevHawk Blog] alternatively suggests to set the `-errorAction` parameter to `silentlyContinue` and, in case the file does not exist, use an
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet/parameter/common/errorVariable[error variable] to get the path for the inexisting file:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/path/resolve/force.ps1||
