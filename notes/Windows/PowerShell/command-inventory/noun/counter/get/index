$ PowerShell cmdLet get-counter

{ Find processor intensive processes #get-counter-process-intensive-processes

  Apparently, it's not possible(?) to find → Windows/development/process[processes] that use much CPU with the cmdlet → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/get[`get-process`].
  -
  In order to find → hardware/CPU intensive processes, the counter `\Process(*)\% Processor Time` can be used:
code {
(get-counter '\Process(*)\% Processor Time').counterSamples |
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/sort[sort-object] cookedValue -desc |
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/select[select-object] -first 10
code }

}

  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/counter
