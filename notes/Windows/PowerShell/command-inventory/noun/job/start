$ PowerShell cmdLet start-job

{ Working directory for jobs

  A job's *working directory* is set to → Windows/dirs/Users/username/Documents[`$home\Documents`] (Windows Powershell) or → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/home[`$home`] (PowerShell Core).
  -
  This is demonstrated by the following simple → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline: it starts a → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/job[job] with a → Windows/PowerShell/language/scriptblock which in turn writes thej0 
  current location (→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/location/get[`get-location`]) to `~/current-directory`.
  -
  After the job has finished, `~/current-directory` can be inspected to determine the current directory of powershell jobs.

  PowerShell 7 finally comes with the new option `-workingDirectory` which allows to change the initial working directory for a background job.
