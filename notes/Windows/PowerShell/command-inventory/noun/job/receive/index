$ PowerShell cmdLet receive-job

`receive-job` collects the result («output») of *background jobs* that were started with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/job/start[`start-job`] or
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlets] using the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/parameter/asJob[`-asJob` parameter].

{ Starting a background job and printing its result

  The following simplistic example starts a job in the background that calculates the → biblisches/Grundtext/Zahlen#n153[17th triangular number (153)].
  -
  In order to pretend that this is a difficult calculation, the job uses → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/sleep/start[`start-sleep`] so that the job is
  not immediately finished.

  After starting the job, the script goes on to do an unrelated task. Every once in a while, it checks the background job's state. If it has finished (`$job.state -eq 'Completed`) and there is
  a result (`$job.hasMoreData`), it collects the result and prints it:
