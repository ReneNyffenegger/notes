$ Remove-Item: A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument

The following command causes the error *Remove-Item : A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument 'two.txt'.*
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/remove one.txt two.txt
code }

This is because → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/remove[`remove-item`] expects an → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array of file names to delete.
-
However, `one.txt two.txt` is not an array, it is two separate arguments.

Thus, in order to delete multiple files, they need to be separated by commas so that PowerShell recognizes them as items of an array;
code {
remove-item one.txt,two.txt
code }
