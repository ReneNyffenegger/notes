$ PowerShell cmdLet invoke-command

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable.

{ Call a script block

{ Running a command on a remote computer

  Using the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/parameter/computerName[`-computerName` parameter], it is possible to run a → Windows/PowerShell/language/command on a remote computer.

  In order to run the command, → Windows/PowerShell establishes a temporary connection. As soon as the command has finished, the connection is closed. Thus,
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables], → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions] etc. that were defined in the command, will be lost.
  -
  In order to prevent such a loss, a → Windows/PowerShell/session#psSession[PsSession] (which is basically a persistent connection) should be created.

  

}
