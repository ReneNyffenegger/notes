$ PowerShell cmdLet Restart-Computer
@ restart-computer

{ Failed to restart the computer ‥

  { The system shutdown cannot be initiated because there are other users logged on to the computer.

    Apparently, `restart-computer` checks if there are still users logged on and fails with *Failed to restart the computer ssva24025 with the following error message: The system shutdown cannot be initiated because there are other users logged on to the computer.* if this is the case.

    It is however possible to use the `-force` parameter which restarts the computer anyway.

  }
  { Failed to restart the computer ‥ with the following error message: system shutdown is in progress. #ps-restart-computer-shutdown-in-progress

    An already initiated system shutdown blocked the restarting of the computer:
code {
PS: C:\> restart-computer tq84srv -credential (get-cred)
Restart-Computer : Failed to restart the computer tq84srv with the following error message: A system shutdown is in progress.
code }

    In this case, I had to kill the → Windows/dirs/Windows/servicing/TrustedInstaller_exe[TrustedInstaller] process:
code {
PS: C:\> taskkill /s tq84srv /u rene /p mySecretPassword /im → Windows/dirs/Windows/servicing/TrustedInstaller_exe /f
SUCCESS: The process "TrustedInstaller.exe" with PID 4312 has been terminated.

PS: C:\> restart-computer tq84srv -credential (get-cred)
code }

  }
}


sa:
  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/command parameter → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/parameter/credential[`-credential`].

  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/computer
