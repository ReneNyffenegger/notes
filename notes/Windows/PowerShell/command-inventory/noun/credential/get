$ PowerShell cmdLet get-credential

The → Windows/PowerShell cmdLet `get-credential` creates a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSCredential[`System.Management.Automation.PSCredential`] object from
a username and a → development/security/password.

{ Prompting user for username and password

  When the cmdLet is inovoked …
code {
PS C:\> $cred = get-credentail
code }

  … it prompts the user for the username and password:

  In order to get a `PSCredential` object without a (what I perceive to be intrusive) message Box, the method → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/host/ui#host-ui-PromptForCredential[`promptForCredential`] of
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/host/ui[`$host.ui`] can be used:
code {
$cred = → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/host/ui[$host.ui].promptForCredential('Connecting to XYZ', 'Enter username and password.', '', 'XYZ')

Connecting to XYZ
Enter username and password.
User: rene
Password for user rene: ********
code }
  
}
{ Getting a PSCredential object without user-interaction #get-credential-no-interaction

  If the username and password are already stored in → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables], it is possible to create a `psCredential` object without
  user interaction:

code {
$username = 'rene'
$password = 'secret!'

$secStr   = convertTo-secureString -string $password -asPlainText -force
$cred     = new-object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secStr
code }

}
