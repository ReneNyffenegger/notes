$ PowerShell cmdLet select-string

`select-string` allows to search for strings that match a substring or a → development/regular-expressions[regular expressions].

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[objects] that are → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[piped] into `select-string` need to be either
→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSObject[`System.Management.Automation.PSObject`] objects or
have a `ToString()` method.

`select-string` returns → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[objects] whose type is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Microsoft/PowerShell/Commands/MatchInfo[`Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.MatchInfo`].

By default, `select-string` tries to match with regular expressions. In order to match a substring (for example to improve performance), the `-simpleMatch` option needs to be given.

{ Find strings in an array

  The following simple → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline pipes a string → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array into `select-string` and uses a regular expression to find
  all strings that don't have the letter *e*:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/string/select/string-array.ps1||

  This pipeline prints:
code {
two
four
six
code }

  Similarly, such a pipeline can also be used to find numbers that have at least two digits:
code {
42, 128, 1, 44 | select-string \d\d
code }

}
{ Selecting lines in files

  With the `-path` option, `select-string` searches for text in files, line by line:
code {
select-string -path .\*.txt 'regexp'
code }

  Whe using `select-string` on files, the output includes the name of the file and the line number where the text was found:
code {
bar.txt:603:quod erat
foo.txt:109:deomonstrandum
foo.txt:721:etc etc etc
code }
 
}
{ Selecting objects with specific property values (-inputObject parameter)

  The following object creates an array of → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSCustomObject[psCustomObjects] and then uses the
 `-inputObject` option of `select-object` to find the property-values of the property `val_2` that contain the letter *a*:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/string/select/psCustomObject.ps1||

  This approach also works on non-psCustomObjects. The following example pipes the result of → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/winEvent/get[`get-winEvent`] into `select-object` to
  find messages that contain the word *failed*.
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/string/select/get-winEvent_inputObject.ps1||

{ Simulating the Linux strings functionality #select-string-strings

  The following example tries to *approximately* simulate the `strings` → Linux/shell/commands[Linux command line command].

  The task I have given myself is to extract the words with *excactly 5 letters* from the following file (named `text`):
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/string/select/strings/text||

  Of course, these words are `three`, `seven` and `eight`.

  This can be achieved with the following → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/string/select/strings/strings.ps1||

  Explanation: first, the text of the file is read with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/content/get[`get-content`] and then
  piped into `select-string`.
  -
  The pattern that matches exactly 5 times is `\b\w{5}\b`:
    • `\b` matches a → development/regular-expressions#regexp-word-boundary[word boundary]
    • `\w` matches any letter (and digits)
    • `{5}` specifies to match the previous atom exactly five times
  -
 `select-string` is given the `-allMatches` option because there are lines where this pattern matches multiple times and I want to capture them all.

  The result of this `select-string` operation is processed in a → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/foreach[`foreach` statement] that iterates
  over each line that matched at least once. This line is assigned to `$matchedLine`.

  In order to find the matched words, another `foreach` statement that iterates over `$matchedLine.matches` and assigns each match to `$matchedWord`.

  Finally, the line number and the matched word can then be printed:
code {
1: three
3: seven
3: eight
code }

}
{ Recursive search for a pattern (grep -R) #select-string-recursively

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline tries to demonstrate how `select-string`, in conjunction with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get[`get-childItem`] might be used to
  recursively search for text patterns in files that are located in and below a given directory. Thus, it sort of does what is known in the Linux/shell universe as → Linux/shell/commands/grep[`grep -R`].

  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/string/select/grep-recursively.ps1||

  When executed, these → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdLets] might print something like
code {
LineNumber rel. path                      Line
---------- ---------                      ----
         1 ..\..\gridView\out\array.ps1   'foo', 'bar', 'baz' | out-gridView -title 'An array'
         4 ..\..\json\convertTo\basic.ps1   bla = 'foo', 'bar', 'baz'
         6 .\grep-recursively.ps1          'foo.*bar' `                                        <# find files that contain foo followed by bar #> |
         1 ..\..\write-host.ps1           write-host "Foo bar baz" -foregroundColor red -backgroundColor yellow
        15 ..\..\write-host.ps1           write-host "foo bar" -noNewline
        17 ..\..\write-host.ps1           # foo bar baz
code }

}
