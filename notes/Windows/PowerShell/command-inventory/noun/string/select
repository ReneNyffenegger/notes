$ PowerShell cmdLet select-string

`select-string` allows to search for strings with → development/regular-expressions[regular expressions]. The → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[objects] that are
  → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[piped] into `select-string` need to be either be → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSObject[`System.Management.Automation.PSObject`] objects or
  have a `ToString()` method.

{ Recursive search for a pattern (grep -R) #select-string-recursively

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline tries to demonstrate how `select-string`, in conjunction with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get[`get-childItem`] might be used to
  recursively search for text patterns in and below files of a given directory. Thus, it sort of does what is known in the Linux/shell universe as → Linux/shell/commands/grep[`grep -R`].
