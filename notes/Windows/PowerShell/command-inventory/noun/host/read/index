$ PowerShell cmdLet: Read-Host

`read-host` reads a line of input.

Usually, `read-host` is used to assign a text that is entered by a user to a → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable:
code {
$val = read-host
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/output/write[write-output] $val
code }

{ Adding a prompt

  With `-prompt`, the user is shown a text after which the value can be entered:
code {
$val = read-host -prompt 'Please enter a value'
code }

  Because `-prompt` is the first parameter of `read-host`, the string `-prompt` can also be left out.

}
{ Entering secure strings

  With `-asSecureString`, the entered value is masked with asterisks and `read-host` returns a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Security/SecureString[`System.Security.SecureString`]:
code {
PS C:\> $sec = read-host -prompt 'Password' -asSecureString
Password: ******
PS C:\> $sec
System.Security.SecureString
PS C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/secureString/convertFrom[convertFrom-secureString] $sec
01000000d08c9ddf0115d1118…
code }

}
