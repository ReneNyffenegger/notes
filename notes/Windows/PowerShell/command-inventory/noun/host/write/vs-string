$ PowerShell: Write-Host vs 'string'

In PowerShell, using → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/host/write[`write-host $obj`] writes a textual representation of the
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/object[object `$obj`] directly to the → Windows/PowerShell/host[host's] console without putting it into the pipeline.

when this → Windows/PowerShell/script[script] is invoked, it prints
code {
foo
bar
baz
code }

  Seemingly, there is no differences between writing a string using `write-host` and simply state a string (which passes it on to the next
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/command in the → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline.

  However, if the output of this script is piped into a command, it becomes clear that the string `"bar"` has «disappeared» from the pipeline:

  Now, the output is:
code {
I have received the object foo
bar
I have received the object baz
code }
