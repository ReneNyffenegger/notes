$ PowerShell cmdLet: write-host

{ Write-host considered harmful

  Jeffrey Snover, the inventor of → Windows/PowerShell, reminds his audience on his blog that
  → http://www.jsnover.com/blog/2013/12/07/write-host-considered-harmful/[using `write-host` is almost always wrong] and that
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/output/write[`write-output`] should be used instead.

  The reason for this is that `write-host` directly writes to the console without a possibility to redirect the output into a log file or to use the output further down
  a → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipeline].
