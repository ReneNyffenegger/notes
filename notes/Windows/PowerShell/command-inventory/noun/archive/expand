$ PowerShell cmdLet Expand-Archive

`expand-archive` extracts the files of a → development/archive-files/zip.

code {
expand-archive  foo.zip
expand-archive  foo.zip  p:\ath\to\dest\dir
code }

{ Unsupported compression methods

  If a zip file is compressed with certain compression methods (such as → development/archive-files/zip#zip-Deflate64[Deflate64]), `expand-archive` cannot expand the zip file's content:
code {
PS:> expand-archive .\some.zip
Expand-Archive : Exception calling "ExtractToFile" with "3" argument(s): "The archive entry was compressed using an unsupported compression method."
code }

}
