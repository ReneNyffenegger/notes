$ PowerShell cmdLet Out-Default

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet `out-default` is automatically added to every → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipeline's] end.

`out-default` tries to render the → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[objects] it receives according to their *format definitions* in a text-representation on the console.

{ If objects are strings

  If these objects are strings, it simply passes these these strings to → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/host/out[`out-host`].

}
{ If there is a registered view for the objects' type

  If the objects are not strings, `out-default` checks if there is a *registered view* for the received objects' types.

  Such views define a → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/format[formatter] for the respective object type. There are four of them and each of them corresponds to a
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet whose verb is → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/format[`format`]:
     • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/custom/format[`format-custom`]
     • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/list/format[`format-list`]
     • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/table/format[`format-table`]
     • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/wide/format[`format-wide`]

}
{ There is no registered view

  If `out-default` does not find a registered view, `out-default` uses the first object it receives to determine the number of properties it has.

  If this number is greater or equal to 5, it pipes the objects to → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/list/format[`format-list`], otherwise
  to → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/table/format[`format-table`].

}
{ Overriding out-default

 `out-default` can be overridden.

  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/default/out/overriding/out-default.ps1||

  A simple → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/default/out/overriding/pipeline.ps1||

  Executing this pipeline prints
code {
overwridden out-default is called
  received: foo
  received: bar
  received: baz
code }

  Remove the overriding `out-default`:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/default/out/overriding/rm-out-default.ps1||

  Unfortunately, I didn't figure out how I can override `out-default` in a → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script file].
