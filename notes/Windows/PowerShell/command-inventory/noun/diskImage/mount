$ PowerShell cmdLet Mount-DiskImage
@ mount-diskImage

`mount-diskImage` mounts a diskimage (`.iso`, `.vhd` or `.vhdx`) so that it can acccessed like a disk.

This cmdlet does not seem to be present in Linux (or PowerShell Core?).

code {
PS> mount-diskImage $home/xyz.iso 
code }

After mounting a disk image, the volume can be seen with `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/volume/get`
