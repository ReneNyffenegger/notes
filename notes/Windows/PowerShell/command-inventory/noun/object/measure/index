{ Measuring statistics of multiple properties (emulate SQL group by)

  The `-property` option allows to specify the properties for which a set of statistical values should be returned. Such a set somewhat corresponds to a record
  that is returned by an → development/databases/SQL/select/group-by[SQL `group by`] operation:

}
{ Pre-calculate value to be returned

}
