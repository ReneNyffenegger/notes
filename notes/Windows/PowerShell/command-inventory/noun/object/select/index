$ PowerShell cmdLet select-object

→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/select/unique[`select-object -unique`]

{ -expandProperty

  `-expandProperty propertyName` turns the property whose name is `propertyName` into a string.

  If the property has nested objects (such as → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array[arrays]), the
  nested elements are each turned seperately into a string, thus increasing the number of → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[objects] in a
  → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipeline].
