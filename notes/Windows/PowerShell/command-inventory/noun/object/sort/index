$ PowerShell cmdLet sort-object

`sort-object` sorts an → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array[array] of → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[objects] based on a given property value, or in absence thereof, on a default
sort property.

Duplicates can optionally be removed from the sorted output by using the `-unique` command option.

Using `-top n` or `-bottom n` only returns the first `n` objects from the head or last `n` object from the tail of the sorted result. (This is somewhat similar to using
→ development/databases/SQL-Server/sql/select/top-n[`top n` queries] in → development/databases/SQL).
