$ PowerShell cmdLet get-content

`get-content` retrieves the content of an → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item[item] at a specified → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/location[location].

{ Files

  Usually, `get-content` is used to read a file. In such a case, `get-content` returns an array of strings (each of which is a text line in the file):
code {
PS C:\Users\Rene> $fileContent = get-content README.txt
PS C:\Users\Rene> $fileContent.GetType().FullName
System.Object[]
PS C:\Users\Rene> $fileContent[0].GetType().FullName
System.String
code }

}
{ Grep for regular expressions

  Because `get-content` returns a file as an array of strings, the array can be → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[piped] into → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/where[`where-object`] to search
  for specific lines that match a criteria (such as a → development/regular-expressions[regular expression]).
code {
PS C:\Users\Rene> get-content README.txt | where-object { $_ -match '\d\d\d' }
code }

}
{ Hexadecimal representation of a file

  The canonical way to get the content of a file in hexadecimal representation is the cmdLet → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/hex/format[`format-hex`].

 `format-hex` also prints a header and the printable characters which sometimes is not what I want.

  If the content of a file needs to be returned as a simple hexadecimal string, `get-content` along with `-encoding byte` and `-raw` might achieve this:

  gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/content/get/hexString.ps1||

  In *PowerShell Core*, there is no `byte` encoding anymore. The `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/content/get[get-content] -encoding byte` needs to be replaced with `get-content -asByteStream`.

}
{ Alias

  An (predefined) → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[alias] for `get-content` is `cat` (which is borrowed from the → Linux/shell/commands/cat[Unix shell command with the same name].

  Another alias is `type` because of the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] command → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/type[`type`].

  Finally, there is the alias `gc`.

}

sa:

  Apparently, the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item[item] for which `get-content` is invoked needs to implement `System.Management.Automation.Provider.IContentCmdletProvider`.

  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/content
