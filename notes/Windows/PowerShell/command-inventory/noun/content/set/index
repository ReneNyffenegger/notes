{ Alias sc vs sc.exe sc-alias

  A standard → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[alias] for `set-content` is `sc`.

  So, if someone is used to invoke → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/sc_exe[`sc.exe`] from → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] by just typing the two letters `sc`, this might lead to unexpected results in
  a → Windows/PowerShell console.

  Therefore, to start, it needs to be given its extension `.exe`:
code {
PS C:\> sc.exe
…
code }

}
