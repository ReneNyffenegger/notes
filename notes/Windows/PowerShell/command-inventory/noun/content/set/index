$ PowerShell cmdLet set-content

`set-content` creates or replaces a file and writes this file's text. In its most basic form, the → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet is given a file name and an Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array whose elements represent
a line in the file. The following example creates (or replaces) the file `just-some.text`:
gh|about-PowerShell|/cmdlets/content/set/write-file.ps1||
After running the statement, the content of `just-some.text` will be:
code {
first line
second line
third line
code }


{ Alias sc vs sc.exe sc-alias

  A standard → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[alias] for `set-content` is `sc`.

  So, if someone is used to invoke → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/sc_exe[`sc.exe`] (the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/services_exe[Service Control Manager] Configuration Tool)
  from → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] by just typing the two letters `sc`, this might lead to unexpected results in
  a → Windows/PowerShell console.
  -
  Therefore, to start the service configuration tool, it needs to be given its extension `.exe`:
code {
PS C:\> sc.exe
…
code }

}
