{ Fining process id if multiple processes have the same name

  At times, there are multiple processes with the same name, and only one of them needs to be killed. `stop-process → design/graphic/GIMP[gimp]*` for example would kill every process that starts with `gimp`.

  So, in order to find the «correct» process id, the following → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline might help.
code {
PS:\> get-process gimp* | select id, starttime
code }

  This pipeline prints a process id along with the time when a process has started which sometimes is an indication which process should be stopped.

{ Alias

  `kill` is an → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias for `stop-process`. (Compare with the equally named → Linux/shell/commands/kill[Linux shell command `kill`].
