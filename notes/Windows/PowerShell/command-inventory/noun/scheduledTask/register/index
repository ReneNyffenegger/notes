$ PowerShell cmdLet register-scheduledTask

code {
$act = new-scheduledTaskAction    -execute msg.exe -argument '* tq84 says hello rene'
$trg = new-scheduledTaskTrigger   -once -at 15:17

# $set = new-scheduledTaskSettingsSet

register-scheduledTask -TaskName  'testy testy' -inputObject $tsk # -user …  -password …
code }


The objects that are produced by a scheduled job (task?) are serialized and written to disk so that they can be consumed later. On order to get rid of them, the scheduled task
needs to be unregistered when it is done executing:
code {
unregister-scheduledTask 'testy testy' -confirm:$false   
code }
