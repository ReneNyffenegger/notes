$ PowerShell cmdLet Remove-ItemProperty

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[PowerShell cmdlet] `remove-itemProperty` removes deletes a property from an item (typically(?) a
→ Windows/registry/tree-structure/value[registry value]).

{ Example: removing a value under a registry key

  The following simple example uses → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/itemProperty/new[`new-item`] to create a → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key], then adds
  three values to that key and pauses (→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/host/read[`read-host`]) to check the registry.

  After hitting enter, the value `xyz` is removed and the script pauses again to verify that the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/value[value] was indeed remove.

  Finally, the registry key is removed with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/remove[`remove-item`].
