$ PowerShell cmdLet set-service

{ Stopping a service

  It is possible to stop a → Windows/services[service] by assigning the `stopped` status to the service:
code {
PS C:\> set-service MySQL80 -status stopped
code }

  However, if a service has dependent services, such as → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[MSSQLSERVER], an error is thrown:
code {
PS C:\> set-service MSSQLSERVER -status stopped
set-service : Cannot stop service 'SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) (MSSQLSERVER)' because it has dependent services.
…
code }

  Such service can be stopped with the better suited cmdLet → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/service/stop[`stop-service`]:
code {
PS C:\> stop-service MSSQLSERVER
code }

}

sa:
  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/command parameter → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/parameter/credential[`-credential`].
