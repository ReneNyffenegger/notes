$ Powershell command verbs

Some PowerShell command verbs include:
  • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/format[`format`]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/out[`out`]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/set[`set`]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/write[`write`]

{ Approved verbs #ps-approved-verb

  When PowerShell was designed, somebody apparently found it necessary to define a list of *approved verbs* and to recommend to name → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlets] using verbs of this list.
  They even thought a user that uses a module that contains functions with unapproved verbs should be warned from such verbs:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/module/import[import-module] .\tabergang
WARNING: The names of some imported commands from the module 'tabergang' include unapproved verbs that might make them less discoverable…
code }
  It is, however, possible to squelsh the warning with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/module/import#import-module-disableNameChecking[`import-module … -disableNameChecking`].
  
  
  This decision is really unfortunate: when trying to use → Windows/PowerShell/tab-completion[tab expansion] because the list of cmdlets that start with verbs such as `get-` etc. seem almost endlessly.

  Note that → Windows/PowerShell considers some words such as `new` to be verbs although in English grammar they are not.

  Also note that there are some standard → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlets] that have non-approved verbs: → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/tee[`tee-object`] and
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/where[`where-object`] (and others?)

  A ~list of approved verbs~ is → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/approved[here].

{ Groups

  Each PowerShell verb belongs to a group. The membership in a group is based on the verb's most common usage.

  The groups (as of PowerShell 7.1) are
    • Common
    • Communications
    • Data
    • Diagnostics
    • Lifecycle
    • Security
    • Other

  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/CmdletAttribute[`System.Management.Automation.CmdletAttribute`] allows to specifiy the name of the
  verb of a → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdLet].
