$ PowerShell: List of approved verbs

A list of → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb#ps-approved-verb[approved verbs] can be produced like so:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/verb/get[get-verb] | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/sort[sort-object] group | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/select[select-object] group, verb
code }

Some of these verbs come in semantic pairs (such as *Open* and *Close*)

These verbs are (PowerShell 7.1):

{ Common

  table { ll

  `Add` and `Remove` ☰
  `Clear` and `Set` ☰
  `Copy` ☰  Apparently, there is no approved verb `Paste`
  `Enter` and `Exit` ☰ Used for commands such as `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/vsDevShell/enter`
  `Search` and `Find` ☰ … but no `Replace`

  table { ll
    `Approve` ☰

  table }

}

{ Security #ps-verb-security
  table { ll
  `Block` and `Unblock` ☰
  `Grant` and `Revoke` ☰ compare with `Deny` of → #ps-verb-lifecycle[Lifecycle]
  `Protect` and `Unprotect` ☰
  table }
}
{ Other
  table { ll
    `Use` ☰
  table }
}
{ Missing or expected verbs

  I wish there was an `Execute` verb (for which `Invoke` seems to be an alternative)

 `Create` is also not approved as verb. Instead, `New` is suggested as alternative.

  Then, there is no `Compile`. PowerShell 7 at least has `Build`.
