$ PowerShell: script cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
@ script cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system

A → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] script should be run:
code {
PS C:\> .\some-script.ps1
code }

The shell responds with
code {
some-script.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system …
code }

→ Companies-Products/Google[Googling] around suggests to set the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/executionPolicy[execution policy] to something like `remoteSigned`:
code {
PS C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/executionPolicy/set[set-executionPolicy] remoteSigned
code }

This time, the shell answers with
code {
PS C:\> Access to the registry key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell' is denied.
code }

Of course, this is because it requires administrator privileges to change the → Windows/registry[registry] key
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/PowerShell/1/ShellIds/Microsoft_PowerShell[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell`]
and the user started PowerShell as an ordinary user only. Thus, he changes the execution policy for the himself (`-scope currentUser`):
code {
PS C:\> set-executionPolicy remoteSigned -force -scope currentUser
code }

And this now works, the shell says
code {
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Powershell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell value of `ExecutionPolicy` was set to `RemoteSigned`.
code }

The script can now be run.

sa:
  The value of the *execution policy* can directly be changed in the → Windows/registry[registry] under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/PowerShell/1/ShellIds/Microsoft_PowerShell[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell`], value
  `ExecutionPolicy`.
