$ PowerShell: Search and replace text in a directory

The following example tries to demonstrate how text can be searched/replaced in files in a directory and its subdirectories.

I use the encoding *iso-8859-1* so that I can replace files in both, latin-1 and UTF-8 encoded files
(as long as the text searched for and replaced with is does not have characters that cannot be represented with latin-1?).

code {
$enc = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding('iso-8859-1')

get-childItem -recurse -attribute !d *.sql | % {

   $fileContentBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($_.FullName)
   $fileContent      = $enc.GetString($fileContentBytes)

   $fileContent      = $fileContent -replace 'rabenschwarz', 'hellgelb'

   $fileContentBytes = $enc.GetBytes($fileContent)
  [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($_.FullName, $fileContentBytes)

}
code }
