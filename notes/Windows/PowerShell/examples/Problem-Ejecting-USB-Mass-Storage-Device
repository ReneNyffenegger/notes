$ PowerShell: determine which application is preventing an USB drive from being ejected

When trying to eject an external → hardware/USB drive («Safely remove hardware and eject media»), Windows might respond with the message ~Problem Ejecting USB Mass Storage Device~
(This device is currently in use. Close any programs or windows that might be using the device, and then try again):
gh|about-PowerShell|/examples/Problem-Ejecting-USB-Mass-Storage-Device/img/msgBox.png||

Unfortunately, the message does not reveal which program or application uses the USB drive. With → Windows/PowerShell, it is possible to determine this application with the
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/winEvent/get[`get-winEvent` cmdLet]:
gh|about-PowerShell|/examples/Problem-Ejecting-USB-Mass-Storage-Device/readEventLog.ps1||

This simple → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline might print something like
code {
TimeGenerated       Message

{ Same thing, but with the event viewer

  BTW, this information can also be determined with the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/eventvwr_exe[Event viewer (`eventvwr.exe`)]
  by going to *Windows Logs* -> *System* -> *Filter Current Log* and the setting the *Event ID* to 225:
