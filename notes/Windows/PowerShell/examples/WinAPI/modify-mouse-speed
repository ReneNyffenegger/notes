$ PowerShell: modify the speed of the mouse

This simple PowerShell script changes the speed of the mouse with the → Windows/development/WinAPI function `SystemParametersInfo()`. Such a modification is, however, not persisted across rebooting the machine. Therefore,
the new mouse speed is also written into the → Windows/registry under the key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control-Panel/Mouse[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse`] (Value of `MouseSensitivity`).
