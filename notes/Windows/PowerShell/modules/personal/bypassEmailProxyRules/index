$ Powershell module: bypassEmailProxyRules

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/module[PowerShell module] *bypassEmailProxyRules* provides some functions that should outsmart *corporate email proxies* so that files can be attached to emails that otherwise couldn't.

{ Functions

  table { ll
   `format-saveEmailProxyExtension` ☰ Turns the → development/filename-extensions[extension of a filename] into an extension that (hopefully) is not rejected by a corporate email proxy (for example `C:\foo\bar.ps1` turns into `C:\foo\bar.p-s-1-`)
   `format-unsaveEmailProxyExtension` ☰ Returns the original filename from one that was changed using `format-saveEmailProxyExtension`
  table }
