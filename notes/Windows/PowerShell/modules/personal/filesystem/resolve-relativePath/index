$ PowerShell module filesystem: resolve-relativePath

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[function] `resolve-relativePath` of the → Windows/PowerShell/language/module → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/filesystem[filesystem]
returns the *relative path* between a directory and a file or directory.
-
Thus, it improves the functionality provided by the built-in cmdlet → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/path/resolve[`resolve-path`] which only allows to get the relative path from the current directory
(→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[`$pwd`]).


code {
resolve-relativePath $fromDir  $destPath
code }

Note: `$fromDir` and `$destPath` must share a common prefix in order for the function to succeed.

This function was inspired (and copied with minor adaptions) by/from
→ https://github.com/webmd-health-services/Carbon/[Carbon's] command → https://get-carbon.org/Resolve-RelativePath.html[`Resolve-RelativePath`].
-
The function uses the → Windows/development/WinAPI function `PathRelativePathTo`.

{ Simple example

code {
$sql_file_root = 'P:\ath\to\development\sql'

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/foreach[foreach] ($file in → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get[get-childItem] $sql_file_root -recurse -include *.sql) {

    $rel_path = resolve-relativePath $sql_file_root $file
    $rel_path

}
code }

}
{ Passing an array to the second parameter

  The second parameter accepts an Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array:
code {
PS:> resolve-relativePath  x/y  x/a/b, x/y/z, x/
..\a\b
.\z
..\
code }

}
