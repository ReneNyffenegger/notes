  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/RstrtMgr_dll[`RstrtMgr.dll`]

  This function was originally copied from → https://github.com/pldmgg/misc-powershell/blob/master/MyFunctions/PowerShellCore_Compatible/Get-FileLockProcess.ps1[Paul DiMaggio's `Get-FileLockProcess` function].

  → https://www.dima.to/blog/?p=220 has some managed and unmanaged code that seems to be able to find the Windows handle of a locked file and the use that handle to close the file.
