$ PowerShell module MS-Office: enable-msOfficeDeveloperTab

The function `enable-msOfficeDeveloperTab` of the → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/MS-Office[PowerShell module `MS-Office`] enables the
→ Microsoft/Office/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/Developer[Developer tab] on Office's Ribbons.

Unfortunately, I was unable to figure out how the Developer tab can be enabled via the → Windows/registry for
→ Microsoft/Office/Visio.
-
→ development/databases/Access[Access] does not have a Developer tab, so it doesn't do anything for Access.

code {
PS C:\> enable-msOfficeDeveloperTab
code }

In order to turn disable the developer tab, the `-off` option can be used:
code {
PS C:\> enable-msOfficeDeveloperTab -off
code }
