$ PowerShell error message: The 'xxx' command was found in the module 'xxx', but the module could not be loaded.

  Trying to run a → Windows/PowerShell/language/command[PowerShell command] results in an error: 
code {
xyz : The 'get-xyz' command was found in the module 'xyz', but the module could not be loaded. For more information,
run 'Import-Module xyz'.
At C:\Users\Rene\bla.ps1:76 char:6
code }

  The message recommends to import the → Windows/PowerShell/language/module[module], which only results in yet another error message:
code {
PS C:\Users\Rene> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/module/import[import-module] xyz
import-module : File …\…\xyz.psm1 cannot be loaded. The file …\…\xyz.psm1 is not digitally
signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies at
→ https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
code }

  The (or at least one of the) solution(s) is to *unblock* the file:
code {
PS C:\Users\Rene> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/file/unblock[unblock-file] …\…\xyz.psm1
code }
