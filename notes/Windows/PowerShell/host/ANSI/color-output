$ PowerShell: coloring the output of a command

This example tries to demonstrate how the output of a → Windows/PowerShell/language/command[PowerShell command] can be colorized with
→ Linux/shell/ANSI-escape-sequences.

{ create-file.ps1

  For this example, we need a dummy file (`xyz.txt`) which is created with the
  following → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/content/set[`set-content] cmdlet:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/host/ANSI/color-output/create-file.ps1||

}
{ format-hex

  We then use → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/hex/format[`format-hex`] on this file.

  A → development/regular-expressions[regular expression] finds → development/line-break[new line] (byte) characters (`0x0a` and `0x0d`); the replacement part
  embeds these characters into the escape secuences for *red* and *reset*:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/host/ANSI/color-output/format-hex.ps1||

}
{ Result

  In the result, the new line characters are now highlighted, which makes it easier, for example, to spot
  DOS or Unix line endings:

  gh|about-PowerShell|/host/ANSI/color-output/img/output.png||

}

sa:
  → Windows/PowerShell/host/ANSI
