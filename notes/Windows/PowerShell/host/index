$ PowerShell host

In order to interact with the functionality of PowerShell, a *host* is needed, such as for example → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/vn_m/powershell_exe[`powershell.exe`] or the
*Integrated Script Environment (ISE)*.

A host initializes a *runspace*.

Typically, the output that is written using the various → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/verb/write[`write-`] commands are presented to the user by the host.

sa:

  The *execution context* of a PowerShell host is stored in a
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/EngineIntrinsics[`System.Management.Automation.EngineIntrinsics`] object. The
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic] PowerShell variable → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/executionContext[`$executionContext`] stores such an instance.

  The PowerShell command noun → Windows/PowerShell/host[host].

  The automatic variable → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/host[`$host`]
