$ PowerShell: Formatting the output of a pipeline

{ Default last cmdlet

  PowerShell automatically places the `out-default` → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlet] the end of every → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipeline].

  By default, `out-default` invokes `out-host`.

}
{ Checking for predefined view

  Are there any *predefined views* that contains the instructions on how format the objects (for example kind of layout such as table or list).
  
  These have a `format.ps1xml` suffix and are installed under the location that the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variable] `$psHome` points at:
code {
PS c:\> get-childItem $psHome -filter *.format.ps1xml
code }

}
{ DefaultPropertySet

  If there is no *predefined view*, PowerShell checks for an object with the special `DefaultPropertySet` property.
  
}
{ Table or list layout

  Without *predefined view* or a `DefaultPropertySet`, the data is formated in a *table* if there are 4 or fewer properties and in a *list* otherwise.

}
{ Formatting cmdlets

  PowerShell provides a few → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlets] that allow to override the default formatting:
    • `format-table`
    • `format-list` (to generate a multicolumn view that (by default) displays the `Name` property).
    • `format-wide`
    • `format-custom` (Probably not used by a user - it is primarly used by *predefined custom views*)


  These `format-*` cmdlets should be the last cmdlets in a → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipeline] except if followed by `out-file`, `out-printer` or `out-host` (the last of which is the last cmdlet by default anyway).

}
