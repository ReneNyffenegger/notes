$ PowerShell: execution policy

The *execution policy* controls which configuration files and → Windows/PowerShell scripts are allowed to be loaded and run.

Execution policies provide a facility to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
-
However, it does not prevent a user from *bypassing* a policy.

Windows stores a user's execution policy in the → Windows/registry under the key
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/PowerShell/1/ShellIds/Microsoft_PowerShell[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell`].

{ Policy values

  { Default

    The *default* policy is
      • *Restricted* for Windows clients
      • *remote signed* for → Windows/versions/Server

  }
  { Bypass

    Run any script without any warning or prompts whatsoever.

  }
  { AllSigned 

    With *allSigned*, scripts (including those written on local computer) can be run.

     If they're not signed by a trusted publisher, the user is prompted for allowance before running the script.

  }
  { RemoteSigned

    With *remoteSigned*, scripts can be run.

    Scripts that don't originate from the computer (i.e. downloaded from the internet) are required to have a → development/security/cryptography/Digital-signature[digital signature] from a trusted publisher.

    Unsigned downloaded script can be unblocked with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/file/unblock[`unblock-file`].

  }
  { Restricted #ps-exec-policy-restricted

?   Only running → Windows/PowerShell/language/command[commands] entered in an interactive → Windows/PowerShell/session are possible.

    Running scripts is not possible, including
      • Formatting and configuration files (`*.ps1xml`)
      • → Windows/PowerShell/language/module[Modules]
      • → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/profile[profiles]

  }
  { Undefined

    No explicit policy value is defined for the current scope. As also the policy *default*, *undefined* effects to
      • *restricted* for Windows clients and
      • *remoteSigned* for Windows Server

  }
  { Unrestricted

    Allows to run unsigned scripts.

  }

}
{ Scope

  Execution policies can be set in different scopes (listed in order of (descending?/ascending?) precedence:
  table { ll
    MachinePolicy ☰
    UserPolicy ☰
    Process ☰ Affects current → Windows/PowerShell/session[session] only, value is stored in → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `PSExecutionPolicyPreference`.
    currentUser ☰
    LocalMachine ☰ Default scope when setting an executino policy without specifying a scope.
  table }

  The actual values for each scope can be determined with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/executionPolicy/get#get-executionPolicy-list[`get-executionPolicy -list`].

}
{ Only meaningful on Windows systems

  Execution policies are only meaningful on computers running → Windows.

  In non-Windows environments, the execution policy defaults to *unrestricted* and cannot be changed.

}
{ Example

code {
PS C:\Users\rene> .\create-zip.ps1
. : File C:\Users\rene\create-zip.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see
  …
  …

PS C:\Users\rene> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/executionPolicy/set[set-executionPolicy] -scope process -executionPolicy bypass
PS C:\Users\rene> write-host $env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference
Bypass
PS C:\Users\rene> .\create-zip.ps1
  …
code }
