$ PowerShell: drive

A → Windows/PowerShell drive is an abstraction for a data store where the stored data can be accessed in a file system like manner. Two prominent examples of such stores are → Windows/file-system[file systems] (obviusly) and
the → Windows/registry[registry].

A drive contains two generic types of objects: *items* and *item properties*.
-
In the *file system* → Windows/PowerShell/language/provider[provider], an item is a file or a directory.

The command noun used for working with drives is → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/nomen/psDrive[`psDrive`].

{ Location

  Some drives (such as those whose → Windows/PowerShell/language/provider[providers] are *Registry* or → Windows/file-system[Filesystem] have a *current location*.

  This location is shown, for example, in the property *CurrentLocation* with the → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlet] `get-psDrive -psProvider fileSystem`.

  See also the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/nomen/location[command noun `location`].

}
{ Cmdlets

  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlet] that allows to see the currently available drives is `get-psDrive`.
  -
  A new drive is created with `new-psDrive`.

  Generic cmdlets to work with a drive's content are
    • `clear-item`
    • `copy-item`
    • `get-childItem`
    • `get-item`
    • `invoke-item`
    • `move-item`
    • `new-item`
    • `remove-item`
    • `rename-item`
    • `set-item`
    • `clear-itemProperty`
    • `copy-itemProperty`
    • `get-itemProperty`
    • `move-itemProperty`
    • `new-itemProperty`
    • `rename-itemProperty`
    • `set-itemProperty`

  The → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/nomen/location[location] (which is the PowerShell lingo for *path*) within (or of) a drive is (not very surprisingly) set with `set-location`.

}
{ TODO

  The *WSMan* drive (which seems to be related to the → Windows/services/installed/WinRM[WinRM service]).

PS C:\> ls wsman:\localhost
