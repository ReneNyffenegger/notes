$ PowerShell: providers

A *provider* allows PowerShell to connect to external data stores and systems such as *Active Directories* or the → Windows/registry[registry].
-
The data is then exhibited in in a *file system like fashion*. Thus, the data is found within a ~→ Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/drive[drive]~ and accessed by a ~path~.
