$ PowerShell: providers
@ provider

A *provider* allows PowerShell to connect to external data sources (aka data stores) as though they were file systems. Therefore, providers are especially useful if the → development/Data is hierarchical in nature, like, for example,
*Active Directory* or the → Windows/registry[registry].

A provider implements one or more ~→ Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/drive[drives]~ each of which contains a (hierarchical) tree.
-
Within a drive, the data itself is located and accessed by a ~→ Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/path[path]~.

{ Built-in providers

  table { ll

    ~Drive~      ☰ ~Data store~
    alias:       ☰ → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliases]
    cert:        ☰ → development/security/cryptography/X_509[x509] ceritificates
    → Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/env[env:]  ☰ Windows → development/environment-variable[environment variables]
    (*)          ☰ File system (drives, directories, files)
    function:    ☰ functions

  Arguably, the most used provider is the FileSystem provider.
