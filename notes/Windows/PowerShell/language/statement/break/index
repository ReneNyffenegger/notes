$ PowerShell: break statement

The `break` statement exits a loop that is controlled by the `for`, → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/foreach[`forEach`],
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/while[`while`], `do` and → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/switch#swith-break[`switch`] statements.

The following example has two nested `for` loops for the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables] `$i` and `$j`. These variables are multiplied (`$res`) and the result is printed. When `$res` becomes
greater or equal to 8, the (innermost) loop is exited:
