$ PowerShell: Pass function/cmdlet parameters by reference


{ Function-parameter definition

  In order to be able to pass a → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters[parameter] to a
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/function or → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet by reference, the parameter needs to be declared as a
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSReference[`System.Management.Automation.PSReference`] type. This type can be abbreviated with the
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/type/accelerators[type accelerator] `[ref]`.

  Optionally, the expected type of the parameter can be specified after `[ref]`, for example `[ref][string]` as shown in the following simple
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/function declaration.

  The value of the parameter that needs to be returned to the caller can then be assigned to the parameter's property `.value`:

}
{ Calling the function

  When calling the function, the variable that receives the out value also needs to be declared with the `[ref]` type accelerator and enclosed in parantheses, as shown
  below:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/language/function/parameter/pass-by-reference/call.ps1||

}
