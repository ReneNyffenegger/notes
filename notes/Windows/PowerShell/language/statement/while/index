$ PowerShell: while statement
@ while

The `while` → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement iterates over a block of statements until a given condition becomes true:
gh|about-powershell|/language/statement/while/condition.ps1||

{ Assingment

  It is possible to perform an assignment to a → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable where the condition is. After assingning a value to the variable, the value of the variable is checked in a boolean context.

  This is demonstrated in the following example:
  gh|about-powershell|/language/statement/while/assignment.ps1||

  Because `0` is considered to be → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/true-false[`$false`] in a boolean context, the loop terminates when `nextNum()` returns `0`. Thus, this script prints
code {
num = 42
num = 99
num = 17
code }

}
