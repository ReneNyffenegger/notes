$ PowerShell: classes
@ class

The `class` keyword allows to define user defined → Windows/PowerShell/language/type[types].

{ Simple demonstration of basic features

  The following simple example tries to demonstrate the most important and basic features of a user-defined class:
     • `class CLS` creates a class, named `CLS`
     • *Class members* are declared with a type and a name (for example `[int] $num`
     •  The *constructor* has the same name as the class (here: `CLS`) and does not have a return type
     •  On the other hand, (member-) → Windows/PowerShell/language/class/method[methods] do have a return type.
     •  Within methods and the constructor, the instance of the → Windows/PowerShell/language/object is referred to by the automatic variable → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/this[`$this`]
