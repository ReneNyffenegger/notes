$ PowerShell: Overriding the default ToString() method

Each → Windows/PowerShell/language/object[PowerShell object] derives from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object[`System.Object`] and therefore has a `ToString()` method that returns
a → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/string that is (typically) used to render an object in readable and understandable for humans
-
This page tries to demonstrate the usefulnes of overriding the default `Tostring()` method.

{ classWithToString

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/language/class explicitely defines a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object#Object-ToString[`ToString()`] method:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/language/class/ToString/classWithToString.ps1||

}
{ classWithoutToString

  This class does not have an explicit `Tostring()` method:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/language/class/ToString/classWithoutToString.ps1||

}
{ Calling ToString()

  When calling `ToString()` on an instance of a class without an explicit definition, The (default) implementation of `ToString()` of
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object[`System.Object`] is invoked. The default implementation simply prints the
 (fully qualified) class name:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/language/class/ToString/callToString.ps1||

}
{ ToString() is called in string interpolation

  When a → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable is embedded in a → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/string («string interpolation»), the variable expands to the value that is returned
  by `ToString()`:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/language/class/ToString/stringInterpolation.ps1||

}
{ ToString() is also called by the Select-String cmdlet #ps-obj-toString-select-string

  When objects are → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[piped] into the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/string/select[`Select-String`] cmdlet, `Select-String` uses the value
  that is returned by the incoming object's `ToString()` method to perform the search. In the following examples, `Select-String` is used to find object that contain an `o`:

}
