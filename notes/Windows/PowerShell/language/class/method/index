$ PowerShell: class methods

{ Writing to the pipeline

  While all output of ordinary PowerShell → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions] is written to the → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline, the behavior of class methods in this regard is fundamentally different:
  only values indicated with the → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/return[`return`] statement is written to the pipeline.

}
sa:
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/class
