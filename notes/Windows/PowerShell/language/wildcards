$ PowerShell: wildcards

Wildcards are used to select strings (or «items») that meet a certain pattern.

The list of possible wildcards is
table { ll
  `*` ☰ Zero, one or more characters
  `?` ☰ Exactly one character
  `[fqR]` ☰ Matches *one* character if is is either `f`, `q` or `R`.
  `[a-f]` ☰ Maches *one* character if is in the range of `a` through `f`.
table }

Wildcards can be used, for example, in
  • the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get#get-childItem-filter[`-filter`] argument of → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/childItem/get[`get-childItem`]
  • the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison/like[`-like` and `-notLike` operators]

Wildcards are way less powerfull than → development/regular-expressions which can be specified with the
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison/match_notmatch[`-match`, `-nomatch`] and `-replace` operators.

sa:
  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters/attributes#ps-param-attr-supportsWildcards[`supportsWildcards` attribute] of a → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters[function parameter].
