$ PowerShell: scopes

The following → Windows/PowerShell items exist in a scope:
  • Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables]
  • Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliases]
  • Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions]
  • Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/drive[drives]

{ Scopes have a hierarchy

  Scopes can nest, that is: a scope can contain other scopes.

  The containing scope is referred to as the *parent scope*, the contained scope as its *child scope*.

  The root of all scopes is the *global scope*.

  An item in a child scope that has the same name as an item in one of its parent scopes hides that item.

}
{ Accesing items in a parent scope

  Within a child scope, it's possible to acess items of its parent scope unless the item is explicitely marked as private (with the `:private` → #scope-modifier[scope modifier]).

}
{ Modifying items

  An item can be modified in the scope in which it was created.

? In a child scope, an item can be modified if the scope is explicitely stated.

}
{ Creating a new scope #ps-create-scope

  A new scope can be created
    • by running a script with the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/call[call operator (`&`)]
    • by executing a → Windows/PowerShell/language/function
    • by starting a session
    • by starting a new PowerShell instance

  When a new scope is created, PowerShell fills it with some items:
    • → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[Aliases] with the *AllScope* option
    • → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[Variables] with the *AllScope* option
    • Some Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic

}
{ Scope modifiers #scope-modifiers

  table { ll
    `global:` ☰
    `local:` ☰
    `private:` ☰
    `script:` ☰
    `using:` ☰
    `workflow:` ☰
    `global:` ☰
  table }

  Scope modifiers are applicable to
     • Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables]
     • Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliases]
     • Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions]

  For example, in order to access a global variable, this is possible with
code {
$global:var = 'value'
code }

  In addition, the PSDrive → Windows/PowerShell/language/provider adds the following *variable namespaces*:
  table { ll
    `alias:` ☰
    `env:` ☰ to access → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variables]
    `function:` ☰
    `variable:` ☰
  table }

}
{ Example

  The following example tries to demonstrate the `:global` and `:script` modifiers in a → Windows/PowerShell/language/function:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/scope/function.ps1||

}


sa:
  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/dot[dot sourcing operator (`.`) can be used to create items in the current scope.
