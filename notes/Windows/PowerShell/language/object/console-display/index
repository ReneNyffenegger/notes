$ PowerShell: displaying objects in the console

When → Windows/PowerShell displays objects that flow out from a → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline, it
uses a set of rules that define how these objects, or more accurately the values of the objects's → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/member[members (properties)], are displayed
in the console.

These rules are defined for object types (typically → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes[.NET types]). In Microsoft's documentation, these rules are referred to
as → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/console-display/views[views].

A → Windows/PowerShell/session[PowerShell session] maintains a list of such views. This list can be viewed with the
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/formatData/get[`get-formatData` cmdlet] and modified for the current session with
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/formatData/update[`update-formatData`].

A new view is (typically) added to a session by creating a → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/console-display/formatting-data/file[formatting file] which is then added to the session with
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/formatData/update[`update-formatData`].

A formatting file that was added to a session cannot be removed anymore.
