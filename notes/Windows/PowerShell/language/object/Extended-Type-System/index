$ PowerShell: Extended Type System (ETS)
@ Extended Type System

The *Extended Type System* of → Windows/PowerShell allows to extend → Microsoft/dot-net types or → Windows/development/COM/object[COM objects] with additional properties and methods.
This is achieved by wrapping the underlying type into a → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/psObject[psObject] (→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSObject[`System.Management.Automation.PSObject`]) object.

{ Member types

  The possible member types with which a `PSObject` can be extended are enumerated in the
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSMemberTypes[`System.Management.Automation.PSMemberTypes` enum].

  For each of these property types, there is a corresponding .NET class that derives from
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSMemberInfo[`System.Management.Automation.PSMemberInfo`].

}


sa:
  The → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/typeData[`typeData`] cmdLet noun.
