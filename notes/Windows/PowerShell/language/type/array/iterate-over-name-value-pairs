$ PowerShell: Iterate over array that contains name/value pairs

In PowerShell, when an → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array#ps-assign-array-to-array[array is assigned to an array with fewer elements] (`$e1, $e2, $rest = $a, $b, $c, $d…`), the values of `$e…` are assigned from the left (`$e1 = $a`, `$e2 = $b` etc.)
and the last element `$rest` is assigned the remaining values as an array. This feature can be used to *iterate over an array that contains name/value pairs*, as showh in the following simple example script:

gh|about-PowerShell|/language/type/array/iterate-over-name-value-pairs.ps1||

When executed, this script prints
code {
text   : hello World
number : 42
fruit  : apple
code }
