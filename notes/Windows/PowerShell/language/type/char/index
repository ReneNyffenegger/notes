$ PowerShell data type: Char

{ ASCII value of a char

  The following construct demonstrates how the → development/Unicode/ASCII value of a `char` can be determined:
code {
[byte][char]'q'
code }

  → Windows/PowerShell does not have a specific → Windows/PowerShell/language/lexical-structure/token/literal[literal]-syntax for chars so that `'q'` denotes a string. Thus, the `'q'` needs first to be cast
  to a `char` before it can be cast to a `byte`.
