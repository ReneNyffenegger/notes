PowerShell has four types of literals:

  • type

{ String literals

  { Here document

    The `@"…"@` can be used like a → Linux/shell/bash/scripts/here-document[here document]. → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[Variables] are expanded and the string may contain apostrophes:
    gh|about-powershell|/language/lexical-structure/token/literal/expandable-here-string.ps1||

code {
The number is: 42,
and it's value "forty-two"
code }

   Note that there must be no character between the starting `@"` and the following → development/line-break[end of line] (Error message *No characters are allowed after a here-string header but before the end of the line.*).
   -
   Similarly, the ending `"@` must be placed at the start of a line.

  }

}
