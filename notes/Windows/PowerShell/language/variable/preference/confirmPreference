$ PowerShell: the preference variable $confirmPreference

Each → Windows/PowerShell command (→ Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdLets], → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliases] etc.) is assigned a
→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/ConfirmImpact[`System.Management.Automation.ConfirmImpact`] enum-value. The possible values of `ConfirmImpact` are:
  • None
  • Low
  • Medium
  • High

For a given command, such as for example → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/stop[`stop-process`], the respective value can be determined like so:
code {
PS C:\> $stopProcMeta = → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new[new-object] → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/CommandMetadata[System.Management.Automation.CommandMetadata](→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/get[get-command] stop-process)
PS C:\> $stopProcMeta.ConfirmImpact
Medium
code }

Now, if the value of the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/preference[preference variable] `$confirmPreference` is lower than that of a command, the command requires the user to confirm the required action.

I try to demonstrate that in the following example. By default, the value of `$confirmPreference` is `High`:
code {
PS C:\> $confirmPreference
High
code }

Because the value of `ConfirmImpact` of `stop-process` is `Medium` only, I can use `stop-process` without being asked for confirmation:
code {
PS C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/start[start-process] notepad
PS C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/stop[stop-process] -name notepad
code }

However, If I set the value of `$confirmPreference` to `Medium`, I will be asked to confirm the killing of a process:
code {
PS C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/start[start-process] notepad
PS C:\> $confirmPreference = 'medium'
PS C:\> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/stop[stop-process] -name notepad

Confirm
