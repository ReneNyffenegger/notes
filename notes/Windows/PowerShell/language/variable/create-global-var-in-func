$ PowerShell: create a global variable in a function

Without using → Windows/PowerShell/language/scopes#scope-modifiers[scope modifiers], a non-global → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variable] that is used within a → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[function] creates the variable for the scope of the function.

Sometimes, there is a requirement to create a (global) variable within a function. This can be achieved by prefixing the variable name with `global:`:
