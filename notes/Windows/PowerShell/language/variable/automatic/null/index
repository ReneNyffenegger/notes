$ PowerShell: The automatic variable $NULL
@ $null

`$null` is an → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variable]. It is the only instance of the null → Windows/PowerShell/language/type[type].

`$null` is also referred to as *null value*.

The value of a → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[PowerShell variable] that was not assigned a value (yet) is `$null`. The value of `$null` itself is
the → development/languages/C-Sharp value `null`.

`$null` can be assigned any value; yet, the value of `$null` remains unchanged:
code {
PS C:\> $null = mkdir temp-dir
PS C:\> $null
code }

Assigning a value of an expression to `$null` is typically used to hide the returned result on the console. In order to be more explicit about this intention, some prefer to
write `mkdir temp-dir | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/null/out[out-null]` instead.

`$null` has a `count` property whose value is `0`:
code {
PS C:\> $null.count
0
code }

{ Types that can't be null

  Strings cannot be `$null` even though `$null` can be assigned to them.
code {
PS C:\> [string] $txt = $null
PS C:\> $txt -eq $null
False
code }
 
  A string that was assigned `$null` is the empty string: 
code {
PS C:\> $txt -eq ''
True
code }

  Integers cannot be `$null` as well and become `0` if a `$null` is assigned to them:
code {
PS C:\> [int] $i = $null
PS C:\> $i -eq $null
False
PS C:\> $i
0
code }

}
{ Checking for a null value

  Unlike the → development/databases/SQL/data-types/null[`null` value in SQL], `$null` can be compared to itself. Thus,
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison[comparison operators] such as `-eq` can be used to check if a variable
  is `$null`:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/if ($val -eq $null) {
  'val is null'
} else {
  'val is not null'
}
code }

}

sa:

 `$null` is implemented by the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/NullVariable[`System.Management.Automation.NullVariable` class].
