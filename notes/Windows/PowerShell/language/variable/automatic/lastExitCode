  Other → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variables]

  My → development/tools/scripts/personal/profile_ps1[`profile.ps`] has the following piece of code which uses the prompt to write the last exit code in red if it is different from 0:
code {
function prompt {
   if ($lastExitCode) {
      $error = "$([char]0x1b)[91mlastExitCode = $lastExitCode$([char]0x1b)[0m`n"
   }
   else {
      $error = ''
   }
   …
   $prompt = "…"
  "$error$prompt"
code }
