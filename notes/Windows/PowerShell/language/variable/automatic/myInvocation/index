$ PowerShell: the automatic variable $myInvocation

{ Type of $myInvocation

  The → Microsoft/dot-net[.NET] framework type of `$myInvocation` is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/InvocationInfo[`System.Management.Automation.InvocationInfo`] as can be demonstrated with
code {
PS C:\> $myInvocation.getType().fullName
code }

}
{ Determining the name of a script

  Arguably, one of the most interesting uses of `$myInvocation` is to figure out the name of a script within a script:
code {
$scriptName = $myInvocation.myCommand.name
code }

}
{ Determining the directory in which a script is located #myInvocation-dir-of-script

  Another interesting case of `$myInvocation` is that it allows to determine the directory in which an script is located:
code {
$dir = split-path $myInvocation.myCommand.path
code }

  Outside of a script, the expression `$myInvocation.myCommand.path` is → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/null[`$null`].
