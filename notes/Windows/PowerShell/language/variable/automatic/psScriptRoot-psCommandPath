$ PowerShell: the automatic variables $psScriptRoot and $psCommandPath

When evaluated within a script being executed, the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variable] `$psScriptRoot` contains the absolute path of the directory where that script is located
and `$psCommandPath` the absolute path of the script itself.

These variables evaluate to → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/null[`$null`] if they're not used within a script.

Because `$PSScriptRoot` evaluates to the → Windows/PowerShell/language/module#ps-module-directory[module directory] when used in a *module script file* (→ development/filename-extensions#psm1[`.psm1`]), it comes in
handy to reference other resources that are related to a → Windows/PowerShell/language/module.
