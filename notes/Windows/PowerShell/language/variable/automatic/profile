$ PowerShell: the automatic variable $profile

The value of the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variable] `$profile` is the file name of a → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] profile for the current user and the current host application. This profile
is executed automatically when → Windows/PowerShell is started.

By means of the *extended type system*, `$profile` actually stores four locations for a profile:
code {
write-output $profile
write-output $profile.allUsersAllHosts
write-output $profile.allUsersCurrentHost
write-output $profile.currentUserAllHosts
write-output $profile.currentUserCurrentHost
code }

Note: *host* in this context does not refer to a computer or server, but rather to the program that is hosting → Windows/PowerShell, compare with the
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/host[cmdLet noun `host`].

sa:

  In order to bypass the execution of the profile file when powershell is started, it needs to be started with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/vn_m/powershell_exe[`powershell.exe -noProfile`].

  Other → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variables]
