$ $?

`$?` is a boolean (→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/true-false[`$true` or `$false`]) that contains the status of the last executed → Windows/PowerShell/language/command.

`$?` can be set by calling → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/Cmdlet#dotnet-cmdlet-Write_[`Cmdlet.WriteError()`] or
→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/Cmdlet#dotnet-cmdlet-ThrowTerminatingError[`Cmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()`].

sa:

  In contrast to `$?`, → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/lastExitCode[`$lastExitCode`] stores the exit code of the last native command or → Windows/PowerShell/script[script] that was run.

  Other → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variables]
