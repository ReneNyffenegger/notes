$ $?

`$?` is a boolean (→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/true-false[`$true` or `$false`]) that contains the status of the last executed → Windows/PowerShell/language/command.

`$?` can be set by calling → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/Cmdlet#dotnet-cmdlet-Write_[`Cmdlet.WriteError()`] or
→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/Cmdlet#dotnet-cmdlet-ThrowTerminatingError[`Cmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()`].

Because a command is required to evaluate the value of `$?`, its value must be checked right after executing a command:
code {
PS C:\Users\Rene> no-such-command
no-such-command: The term 'no-such-command' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program …

PS C:\Users\Rene> $?
False

PS C:\Users\Rene> $?
True
code }

sa:

  In contrast to `$?`, → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/lastExitCode[`$lastExitCode`] stores the exit code of the last native command or → Windows/PowerShell/script[script] that was run.

  → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/pipeline-chain[Pipeline chain operators]

  Other → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic variables]
