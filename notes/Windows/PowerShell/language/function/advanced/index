{ Differences from compiled cmdlets

  → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions_advanced[Microsoft's documentation] lists the following three differences between advanced
  functions and compiled cmdlets:
    • Advanced function parameter binding does not throw an exception when an array of strings is bound to a Boolean parameter.
    • The ValidateSet → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters#ps-param-attribute[attribute] and the ValidatePattern attribute cannot pass named parameters.
    • Advanced functions cannot be used in transactions.
