$ PowerShell: filter
@ filter

A *filter* is a → Windows/PowerShell/language/function that just has a → Windows/PowerShell/language/function/begin-process-end-block[process block].

The following two command are equivalent:
code {
filter twice {
    2 * $_
}

function times_two {
    param(
        [parameter(mandatory, → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/function/parameters/attributes/parameter/valueFromPipeline[valueFromPipeline])]
        [int] $num
    )

    process {
        2 * $num
    }
}
code }

These commands can be invoked in a → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline like so:
code {
7,21,48 | twice
8,24,11 | times_two
code }
