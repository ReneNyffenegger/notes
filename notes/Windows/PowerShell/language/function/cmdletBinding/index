A → Windows/PowerShell/language/function with cmdlet binding automatically defines the common parameters `-errorAction` etc.

{ Influence on write-verbose

  One effect of annotating a function with `[CmdletBinding()]` is that the `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/verbose/write` cmdlet is enabled.

  In the following example, the invocation of `wv-with … -verbose` prints the value of `$p` while the invocation of `wv-without … -verbose` does not have (any visible, at least) effect:
