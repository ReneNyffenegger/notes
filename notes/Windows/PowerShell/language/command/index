$ PowerShell: command
@ command

A PowerShell command is one of the following:
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdLet]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[alias]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[function]
  • filter (a function with a *process block*)
  • → Windows/PowerShell/script[script]
  • application

{ Precedence

   When entering a command in a PowerShell session, the following order of precedence is applied to resolve the command if multiple commands have the same name:
    • alias
    • function / filter
    • cmdLet
    • applications: → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executables] and non-Powershell scripts (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch files])
    • external scripts: PowerShell scripts with the → development/filename-extensions#ps1[`.ps1`]
    • → Windows/PowerShell/language/scriptblock[script block] (are they named?)

  An example of an ambigous command on Windows, PowerShell 5.1, is `sc` which can refer either to the executable
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/sc_exe[`sc.exe`] or the alias for → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/content/set[`set-content`]) (Apparently, in PowerShell 7,
 `sc` is not pre-defined as alias anymore):
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/get sc -all

CommandType     Name                Version    Source
-----------     ----                -------    ------
Alias           sc -> Set-Content
Application     sc.exe              10.0.19... C:\WINDOWS\system32\sc.exe
code }

  In order to make sure that a specific command type is executed, the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/call[call operator (`&`) might be used on an object
  that is returned by `get-command … -commandType …`:
code {
& (get-command sc -commandType application) query
code }

  If a command cannot be resolved, PowerShell also tries to resolve it by prepending it with `get-`. For example: entering `job` executes
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/job/get[`get-job`].


}

sa:

  The cmdLet noun → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command[`command`].

  The value of a → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable can be evaluated as a command with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/expression/invoke[`invoke-expression` cmdLet].

  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic[automatic] variable → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/myInvocation[`myInvocation`] stores information
  about the current command *if* the command is a script, a function or a script block.

  The → Microsoft/dot-net class → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/CommandInfo[`System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo`].

  → Windows/PowerShell/host/ANSI/color-output[Coloring the output] of a command.

  The time it takes to finish a command can be measued with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/measure[`measure-command` cmdlet]

  The status of the last executed command is stored in the → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/question-mark[automatic variable `$?`]
