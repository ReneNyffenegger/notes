$ PowerShell: command
@ command

A PowerShell command is one of the following:
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdLet]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[alias]
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[function]
  • filter
  • script
  • application

{ Precedence

  When entering a command in a PowerShell session, the following order of precedence is applied to resolve the command:
    • alias
    • function
    • cmdLet
    • → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executables] and non-Powershell scripts (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch files])

  ? If a command cannot be resolved, PowerShell also tries to resolve it by prepending it with `get-`. For example: entering `job` executes
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/job/get[`get-job`].


}

sa:

  The cmdLet noun → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command[`command`]

  The → Microsoft/dot-net class → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/CommandInfo[`System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo`].
