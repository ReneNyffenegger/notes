$ PowerShell: array subexpression operator

The *array subexpression* operator `$(…)` creates an → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array from the expression within its parentheses. Such an array is created even if the
expression evauluates to zero or one element only.

{ Simple demonstration

  In order to demonstrate the array subexpression operator, three → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions] are created. `func_0` returns *nothing*, `func_1` returns a scalar («one element») and
 `func_n` returns more than one element (here: 3)

  The following snippet embeds these functions into the array subexpression operator and creates three arrays whose number of elements correspond to the number of elements that are
  returned by the embedded function:

   Compare with `@{ … }` which creates → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/hash-table[hash tables].
