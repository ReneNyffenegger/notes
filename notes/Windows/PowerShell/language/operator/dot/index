$ PowerShell: dot sourcing operator

The *dot sourcing operator* (`.`) runs a script in the *current* scope.
-
Thus, code that executed with the dot sourcing operator can add, delete or modify → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions], → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliases], → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables] etc.
-
This is in contrast to the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/call[call operator (`&`)] that executes code in *child scope* so that the current scope remains unchaged. 

{ Syntax

  The dot of the operator is seperated by one or more whitespaces from the absolute or relative path of the script to run:
code {
. p:\ath\to\script.ps1
. .\script.ps1
code }

  Note: In `. .\script.ps1`, the first dot is the operator, the second dot is part of the relative path and indicates the current directory.

}

  → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator[operators]
