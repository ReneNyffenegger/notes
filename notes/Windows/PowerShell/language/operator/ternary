$ PowerShell: ternary operator

The *ternary operator* allows to rewrite a simple → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement/if[`if ($cond) { $expr_true } else { $expr_false}`] statement like so (and thus save a few key strokes, the most expensive resource in a programmer's life):
code {
$cond ? $expr_true : $expr_false
code }

The ternary operator was included in (I believe) PowerShell 7.1.
-
In some earlier versions, it was possible to enable the ternary operator as an *experimental operator*:
code {
PS C:\> enable-→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/experimentalFeature[experimentalFeature] PSTernaryOperator
code 
 
sa:

  → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator[operators]
