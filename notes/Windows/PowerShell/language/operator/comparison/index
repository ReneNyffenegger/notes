$ PowerShell comparison operators

The → Windows/PowerShell comparison → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator[operators] are:
  • `-eq` (equal to)
  • `-ne` (not equal to)
  • `-gt` (greater than)
  • `-lt` (less than)
  • `-le` (less than or equal to)
  • `-ge` (greater than or equal to)
  • `-like` (wildcard string comparison, wildcards being `*` and `?`), not to be confused with the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/contains[`-contains` operator].
  • `-notLike`
  • `-match` (Matching with → development/regular-expressions[regular expressions])
  • `-notMatch`

These operators, if used on strings, are *case insenstive* by default. In order to make them case sensitive, they need to be prefixed with a `c` (for example `-cgt`)
-
It's also possible to *explicitely state case senstive comparison* by prefixing the operator name with an `i` (For example `-ieq`).
