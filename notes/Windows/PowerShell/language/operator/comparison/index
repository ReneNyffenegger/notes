$ PowerShell comparison operators

The → Windows/PowerShell comparison → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator[operators] are:
  • `-eq` (equal to)
  • `-ne` (not equal to)
  • `-gt` (greater than)
  • `-lt` (less than)
  • `-le` (less than or equal to)
  • `-ge` (greater than or equal to)
  • `-like` and `-notLike` (wildcard string comparison, wildcards being `*` and `?`), not to be confused with the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/contains[`-contains` operator].
  • → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison/match_notmatch[`-match` and `-notMatch`] (Matching with → development/regular-expressions[regular expressions])

{ Case sensitiveness

  These operators, if used on strings, are *case insenstive* by default. In order to make them case sensitive, they need to be prefixed with a `c` (for example `-cgt`)

  It's also possible to *explicitely state case senstive comparison* by prefixing the operator name with an `i` (For example `-ieq`).

}
{ Scalar vs array #ps-comparison-ops-array

  The operators `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-ge` and their case sensitive cousins return a boolean if applied to a scalar. 

  If they're applied to an → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array[array], they behave like a → science/computer/Programming-paradigm/Functional-programming/First-class-function/filter[filter (functional programming)] and only return the elements
  of the array that satisfy the comparison operator. (Compare with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/where[`where-object` cmdLet].

{ Required methods and interfaces #comparison-required

  In order for the comparison operators to return a meaningful value, the classes the operator operates on need to implement the
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IComparable[`System.IComparable`] interface and override the
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object#Equals-GetHashCode[`Equals()` and possibly also `GetHashCode()`] methods of the
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object[`System.Object`] class that every other class inherits.
