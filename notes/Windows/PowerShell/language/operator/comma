$ PowerShell: comma operator

{ Binary comma operator

  The binary comma operator is used to create → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array[arrays]:
code {
$ary = $elem_one, $elem_two, $elem_three
code }

}
{ Unary comma operator #ps-unary-comma-operator

  There is also a unary comma operator which creates an array with one element only. Note that the comma needs to be placed *before* the element:
code {
$ary = ,42
code }

  The unary comma operator might be used, for example, in → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions] to
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array/byte#ps-func-return-byte-array[return arrays] (such as → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array/byte[byte arrays]).

}
