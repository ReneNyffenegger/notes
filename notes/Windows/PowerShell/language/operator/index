$ PowerShell: operators
@ operator


The → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/subexpression[subexpression operator `$(…)`] is primarly used to evaluate an expression and incorporate its result into a string.

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/array-subexpression[`@(…)`] is the *array subexpression* operator: it creates an → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array from the expression within its
parentheses, regardless if the expression evaluates to 0, 1 or more elements.

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comma[`,`] with two variants (unary and binaray), both of which create → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array[arrays].

`-not` (two variants: → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/logical[logical] and bitwise)

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/arithemtic[Arithmetic] operators: `+`, `-` `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `-shl`, `-shr`, `-band`, `-bnot`, `-bor`, `-xor`
-
Note that the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/forEach[`forEach-object`] → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlet] can also be 
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/forEach#forEach-object-abbr[abbreviated with `%`].

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/string-manipulation[String manipulation] (`-join`, → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/string-manipulation/split[`-split`] (unary and binary) and `-replace`)

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/as[`-as`] operator *casts* a value into a different type.
-
A value can also be cast by prepending a type before it: `[int]0x40`.

*range operator*. It creates an unconstrained one dimensional → Windows/PowerShell/language/type/array[array]. (see also `..`)

The format operator (→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/f[`-f`]) formats strings.

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/in[`-in`] and `-notIn` check if a value is (not) present in a collection.

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/call[call (or invoke)] operator `&` executes script files, → Windows/PowerShell/language/scriptblock[script blocks],
→ Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executables] etc. with *child scope*. Thus, they cannot
modify the current → Windows/PowerShell/language/scopes[scope].
-
The → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/dot[dot sourcing operator] (`.`) runs a script in the *current* scope and thus can add, delete or modify
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/function[functions], → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliases], → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable[variables] etc.

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/logical[logical]: `-and`, `-or`, `-xor`, `-not`, `!`

assignment

The → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/redirection[redirection operators] (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, `2>&1`) send a → Windows/PowerShell/language/command[command's] or an expression's output
to a file.

→ Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison[Comparison operators] (`-eq`, `-gt`, …)

PowerShell 7 also has the → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/ternary[ternary operator] ( `$cond ? doSomething : doAnotherThing` )

{ Setting the color used for operators

  PowerShell allows to define a color that is used for operators when using an interactive shell:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/psReadLineOption/set[set-psReadLineOption] -colors @{
   operator = 
      "$([char]27)[38;2;255;127;0m"   +  # forground color: orange
      "$([char]27)[48;2;100;120;130m"    # background color: grey
}
code }

}
{ Experimental operators

  PowerShell Core uses → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/experimentalFeature[experimental features] to introduce some experimental operators:
    • → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/ternary[ternary operator]
    • `&&` and `||` are → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/pipeline-chain[pipeline chain operators]: they occur between → Windows/PowerShell/pipeline[pipelines]

  These operators can be enabled with
code {
PS C:\> enable-→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/experimentalFeature[experimentalFeature] PSTernaryOperator
PS C:\> enable-→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/experimentalFeature[experimentalFeature] PSPipelineChainOperators
code }

}
{ Misc

  Operators cannot be → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[aliased].
