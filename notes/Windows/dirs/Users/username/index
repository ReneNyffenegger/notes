$ %USERPROFILE%

The directory pointed at with the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `%userprofile%` stores personal data of a specific → Windows/user-account[user].

The value of `%userprofile%` usually is `c:\Users\username` (`username` being lowercase of `%username%`?)

Apparently, in Windows 10, the variable `%CSIDL_PROFILE%` is equivalently used for `%USERPROFILE%`.
