$ %USERPROFILE%

The directory pointed at with the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `%userprofile%` stores personal data of a specific user.

The value of `%userprofile%` usually is `c:\Users\username` (`username` being lowercase of `%username%`?)

Apparently, in Windows 10, the variable `%CSIDL_PROFILE%` is equivalently used for `%USERPROFILE%`.

sa:
  → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData stores application data.

  The → development/tools/scripts/personal/cdhom_bat[`cdhom.bat`] script takes one to this directory in → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe].
