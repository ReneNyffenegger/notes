$ %USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig

`%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig` stores settings for  Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux[WSL] (only version 2?) globally, i.e. for all installed distributions.

code {
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=4GB 

#    Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
processors=2

#    Specify a non-default Linux kernel (for example after → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux#wsl-compile-kernel[compiling one]).
#    The default kernel used can be found at → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel
#    The default location for the kernel is → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/lxss/tools[%SystemRoot%\system32\lxss\tools\]\kernel
#    In at least one WSL installation, I have found the value of kernel to be → Windows/dirs/Users/username/dxg-ioctl[C:\\Users\\username\\dxg-ioctl].
kernel=C:\\temp\\myCustomKernel

#   Sets additional kernel parameters, in this case enabling older Linux base images such as Centos 6
kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate

#   Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
swap=8GB

#   Sets swapfile path location, default is %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp\swap.vhdx
swapfile=C:\\temp\\wsl-swap.vhdx

#   Disable page reporting so WSL retains all allocated memory claimed from Windows and releases none back when free
pageReporting=false

#   Turn off default connection to bind WSL 2 localhost to Windows localhost
localhostforwarding=true

#   Disables nested virtualization
nestedVirtualization=false

#   Turns on output console showing contents of dmesg when opening a WSL 2 distro for debugging
debugConsole=true

#   Uncomment to turn off support for GUI applications in WSL:
# guiApplications=False

#   Mirrored networking improves compatibility with complex networking environments,
#   especially VPNs and more, as well as adding support for new networking features
#   unavailable in the default NAT mode like IPv6:
# networkingMode=mirrored

# dnsTunneling=true

#   Use Window's proxy information.
#   Recommended to set to true if a proxy
#   is configured in Windows.
# autoProxy=true

  Settings for a particular distribution go into `→ Linux/fhs/etc/wsl_conf`.
