{ .obsolete hiding extensions

  I once found a file named `.obsolete` in this directory which somehow hid all extensions. When I removed `.obsolete`, the extensions were visible again.
  
  Unfortunately, I didn't find any documentation about this behavior and am not sure if this is expected or why that happened.
