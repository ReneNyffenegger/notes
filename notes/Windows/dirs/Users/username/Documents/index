$ C:\users\username\Documents
@ Documents

The `Documents` special folder (aka my documents) is different from the *MyDocuments virtual folder* which appears under the *Desktop virtual folder*
in the Windows Shell Namespace.


{ Determining the location of the Documents folder

  In → Windows/PowerShell, the location of the *Documents* folders can be queried with
code {
[environment]::getFolderPath('mydocuments')
code }

}

sa:

  The → development/languages/VBA/functions[VBA function] `curDir()` seems to return this directory path by default.

  The → Microsoft/dot-net enumeration → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Environment/SpecialFolder[`System.Environment+SpecialFolder`].
