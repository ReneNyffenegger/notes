$ %AppData%\Microsoft\Office\MSOxxxx.acl

An `.acl` file is an *AutoCorrect List* file. These are the files where → Microsoft/Office[Office] stores *unformatted* auto-correct entries. (*Formatted* entries for
→ Microsoft/Office/Word[Word] are stored in the → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Templates/Normal_dotm[Normal.dot] file).

The number in the filename (xxxx) refers to the  → Windows/development/Internationalization/language#windows-languages[language id] of the autocorrections.
-
The special number `0127` (`MSO0127.acl`) is for *Math AutoCorrect* entries.

The files seem to be encoded in → development/Unicode/UTF[UTF] 16, → development/endianness[little endian] with some byte-clutter that help to index the entries.
