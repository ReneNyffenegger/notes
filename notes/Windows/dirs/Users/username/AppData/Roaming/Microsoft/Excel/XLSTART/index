$ %appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART

`%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART` is a directory where → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] searches for workbook templates and the 
→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel/XLSTART/Personal_xlsb[`Personal.xlsb`].

? Whenever Excel is started, it opens all → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Workbooks] that it finds in the XLSTART file.

This directory is in the default list of → Microsoft/Office/security/Trust-Center/Trusted-Locations for
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel, → Microsoft/Office/Word and → Microsoft/Office/PowerPoint.
 
{ Templates 

  The special (→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Templates[template]) files (`.xltx`, `.xltm`) `Book.xlt*` and `Sheet.xlt*` are used as defaults when a new Excel
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook or → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet is created.

? Apparently, in non English installations of → Microsoft/Office/Excel, the names of these files are subject to localization. For example, in a french installation, their respective names are
*Livre.xltx* and *Feuille.xltx*.

? TODO: when a workbook is created with File -> New -> Blank Workbook, the template file seems not to be considered.
