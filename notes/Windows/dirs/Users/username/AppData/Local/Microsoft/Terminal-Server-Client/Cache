$ C:\Users\_username_\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache\

The `C:\Users\_username_\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache\` directory locally caches bitmaps to improve
performance for → Windows/Remote-Desktop-Services[remote desktop] connections. 

When I once had my remote destops rendered «pixelized», I could solve the problem by deleting the files in this directory.
