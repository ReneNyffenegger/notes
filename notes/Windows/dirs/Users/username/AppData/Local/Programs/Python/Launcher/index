$ C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Launcher

On my (per-user) → development/languages/Python/installation/directory[installation of Python], I found the following files in `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Launcher`:
  • `py.exe`  (Apparently, this executable is also found as → Windows/dirs/Windows/py_exe[`C:\Windows\py.exe`] if Python is installed *for all users*).
  • `pyw.exe`
  • `pyshellext.amd64.dll`
