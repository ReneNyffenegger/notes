$ %PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps

`WindowsApps` is a hidden folder where → Windows/versions/10 (?) keeps installed apps from the Store.

The value of the → Windows/development/environment-variables[Environment Variable] `%PROGRAMFILES%` is typically → Windows/dirs/Program-Files[`C:\Program Files`], thus the `WindowsApps` directory is located in
`C:\Program Files\WindowsApps`.
