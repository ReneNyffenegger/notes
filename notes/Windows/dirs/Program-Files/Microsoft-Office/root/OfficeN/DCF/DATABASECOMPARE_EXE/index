$ DATABASECOMPARE.EXE

`DATABASECOMPARE.EXE` is the executable for *Database Compare*.

This tool allows to compare two → development/databases/Access[Access] desktop databases and display differences in tables, queries, reports, object designs, → development/languages/VBA code etc.
-
It *does not* compare the data that is stored in the compared databases. In order to compare the data, it should be exported to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Excel workbooks] whose content
can then be compared with → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-Office/root/OfficeN/DCF/SPREADSHEETCOMPARE_EXE[`SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE`]. (The content of an Access table can be exported to
an Excel sheet with the menu → Microsoft/Office/Access/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/External-Data/Export[External Data -> Export]).
