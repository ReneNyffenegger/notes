$ SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE

`SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE` is the executable of *Spreadsheet compare* which is a tool that allows to graphically compare two
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Office Workbooks].

*Spreadhsheet compare* is able to detect differences in
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[Formulas]
  • Calculated values
  • Links
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/WorkbookConnection[Workbook connections] (?)
  • Formatting
  • Names (See → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/Formulas/Defined-Names/Name-Manager[Name manager])
  • Structural changes
  • Errors

The result of a comparison can exported in another Excel sheet for analysis or reporting purposes.

This tool is only available with *Office Professional Plus 2013*, *Office Professional 2016*, or *Office 365 ProPlus*.

{ Starting Spreadsheet Compare on the command line

  The executable can be started from a → Windows/PowerShell command line like so:
code {
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Client\→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-Office/root/Client/AppVLP_exe[AppVLP.exe]" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Root\Office16\DCF\SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE"
code }

  In the → Windows/configuration/Start-menu, the program is found under *Microsoft Office Tools*.

  { Specifying two workbooks to compare on the command line

    When `SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE` is compared it can be passed an optional argument that names a file that contains the file names of the Excel workbooks to be compared, each being on its own line, for example like so
code {
C:\users\rene\sales-2019.xlsx
C:\users\rene\sales-2020.xlsx
code }

  If this file is named `excels-to-compare.txt`, the excel sheets it contains can then be compared like so:
code {
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Client\→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-Office/root/Client/AppVLP_exe[AppVLP.exe]" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Root\Office16\DCF\SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE" excels-to-compare.txt
code }

    Note that after invoking `SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE` with such a file-argument, the file is deleted by `SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE`.


  }

}
{ Performance

  When I tested `SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE` (2020-11-24) with two Excel sheets with 2985 and 2991 rows, respectively and 116 columns, I had to kill the program because the program was not only sluggish but effectively froze

  So, for the time being, I have come to the conclusion that `SPREADSHEETCOMPARE.EXE` is not useable for serious data comparison.
