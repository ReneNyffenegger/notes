   `/compact access-db|access-proj` ☰ Compacts and repairs the Access database, or compacts the Access project that was specified before the `/compact` switch, and then closes Access. If the target file name  is ommited following the `/compact` switch, the file is compacted to the original name and folder. To compact to a different name, a target file needs to be specified. Paths with spaces are required to be enclosed in quotes.
   `/x macro` ☰ Run the specified macro. Compare with the macro named `AutoExec`.
   `/cmd` ☰ Specifies that what follows on the command line is the value that will be returned by the Command function. This option must be the last switch on the command line.
