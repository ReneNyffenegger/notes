$ SELFCERT.EXE

`SELFCERT.EXE` creates a self-signed digital → development/security/cryptography/Public-key-certificate[certificate] that bears the name that is typed in when executed (which does not
identify the user's identity).

Since a self-signed digital certificate might be fake, users will receive a security warning ehwn they open a file that contains a macro project with a self-signed signature.

→ Microsoft/Office will only allow you to trust a self-signed certificate on the machine on which it was created.

A self-signed certificate is only for personal use.

{ Viewing a self signed certificate

PS: Cert:\> cd .\\CurrentUser\My
PS: Cert:\CurrentUser\My> ls
…
code }

  In → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/certmgr_msc[`certmgr.msc`], the certificate is found under the folder *Personal -> Certificates*.
