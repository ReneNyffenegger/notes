$ XLCALL32.DLL

*Microsoft Excel Callback DLL*, possibly used for → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Add-ins/XLL[XLLs].

? Two somewhat important exported functions of `XLCALL32.DLL` seem to be `Excel4` and `Excel4v`. Then, there is also `XlCallVer`.

? The functions `Excel4` and `Excel4v` (as well as the functions `Excel12` and `Excel12v`, which are not exported by `XlCall32.lib`) provide the functionality to make calls («call backs») into Excel.

{ Function suffixes

  The function suffixes `12` and `12v` have been introdued with Excel 2007 while the `4` and `4v` suffix was already existent earlier.

  The API version to be used is determined by the value of the macro `XLL_VERSION` (which can be defined to be `4` or `12`).
