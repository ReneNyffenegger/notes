→ development/databases/SQL-Server IO Simulator

`SQLIOSIM.COM` provides the same simulation capabilities as like → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-SQL-Server/MSSQLnn_INSTANCENAME/MSSQL/Binn/SQLIOSIM_EXE[`SQLIOSIM.EXE`], yet `SQLIOSIM.COM` is a command line tool that can be run without
user interactio and is controlled with command line parameters.
-
`SQLIOSIM.EXE` on the other hand is a → development/GUI application that does not accept any command line parameters.
