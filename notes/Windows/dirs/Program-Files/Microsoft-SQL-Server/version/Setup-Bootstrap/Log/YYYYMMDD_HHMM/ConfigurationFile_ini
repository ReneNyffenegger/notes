$ %programfiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\version\Setup Bootstrap\Log\YYYYMMDD_HHMM\ConfigurationFile.ini

The `ConfigurationFile.ini` file contains the input settings that were provided during an installation of → development/databases/SQL-Server.

This file can be used to restart an installation without having to re-enter these settings again. (→ development/security/password[Passwords] etc. are not saved, however).
