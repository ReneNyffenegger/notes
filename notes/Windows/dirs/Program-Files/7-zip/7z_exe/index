$ 7z.exe

`7z.exe` is the command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell) version of
→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/7-zip[7-Zip].

{ Creating a zip file

  `7z.exe` can be used to create a → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/7-zip[zip file] on the command line. When `7z.exe` is invoked, it needs the `a` argument and a list of files. The list of files
  may include the wildcard `*`.

  The following command adds *all* files (`*`) including those of subdirectories (`-r` = recursively) to a zip file named `file.zip`. If `file.zip` does not exist, it will be created.
code {
C:\> 7z.exe a file.zip * -r
code }

}
{ Creating a zip file from a select list of files

  At times, a zip file needs to be created that contains a subset of files stored in multiple subdirectories. If this list of files cannot be identified by
  a simple (or complicated) wildcard, instead of using `*`, each file can be individually specified in the `7z a` command.

  In the following example, I use the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/line-continuation[line continuation character] (`^`)
  to write each file on a separate line to make it visually easier for a human to see what's going on.

code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/del FooBarBaz.zip

"c:\Program Files\7-zip\7z.exe"  a foobarbaz.zip   ^
     README.txt                                    ^
     theData.xlsx                                  ^
     SQLs\schema\create-tables.sql                 ^
     SQLs\schema\create-views.sql                  ^
     VBA\accessBootstrap.vbs                       ^
     VBA\init.bas                                  ^
     VBA\loadModules.bas
code }

{ Extracting files from a zip file

  Files can be extracted from zip file on the command line with the `x` command:
code {
C:\> 7z.exe x file.zip
code }

  Note: there is also an `e` command. Unlike `x`, `e` will not create the files with the directory structure that they were added to the zip file.

}
{ Extracting files to an aribtrary directory

  The `-o` flag specifies the target directory into which the archive files are extracted.

  There must be no space between `-o` and the directory path:
code {
C:\Users\Rene\Downloads> "c:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x theArchive.7z -oc:\Users\Rene\dest
code }

}
{ Specifying destination directory when extracting 7z.exe files #extract-7z-exe

  The `-o` flag can also be used to specify the destination directory when extracting from `*.7z.exe` files:
code {
C:\Users\Rene\Downloads> .\xyz.7z.exe -o %temp% -y
code }

  The `-y` option prevents asking for confirmation.
