$ 7z.exe

`7z.exe` is the command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell) version of
→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/7-zip[7-Zip].

{ Creating a zip file

  `7z.exe` can be used to create a → → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/7-zip[zip file] on the command line. When `7z.exe` is invoked, it needs the `a` argument and a list of files. The list of files
  may include the wildcard `*`.

  The following command adds *all* files (`*`) including those of subdirectories (`-r` = recursively) to a zip file named `file.zip`. If `file.zip` does not exist, it will be created.
code {
C:\> 7z.exe a file.zip * -r
code }

}
{ Extracting files from a zip file

  Files can be extracted from zip file on the command line with the `x` command:
code {
C:\> 7z.exe x file.zip
code }

  Note: there is also an `e` command. Unlike `x`, `e` will not create the files with the directory structure that they were added to the zip file.

}
{ Specifying a list of files in a batch file

  At times, a zip file needs to be created that contains a subset of files stored in multiple subdirectories. If this list of files cannot be identified by
  a simple (or complicated) wildcard, each file can be individually specified in the `7z a` command.

  To make it visually easy for the eye to see the individual file names (especially when used in a
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file], the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/line-continuation[line continuation character ^] can be used:
code {
7z.exe  a  file.zip    ^
  README.txt           ^
  dir/image.png        ^
  dir/subdir/foo.xlsx  ^
  otherdir/bar.docx
code }
