$ VBoxSVC.exe

`VBoxSVC.exe` is the → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox service process. (It seems that, on → Windows, service does not refer to a → Windows/services[Windows service]).
This service
  • is responsible for bookkeeping
  • maintains the state of all → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox/virtual-machine[virtual machines]
  • provides communication (based on COM/XPCOM) between Virtual Box components.

This executable is started with the first Oracle VM VirtualBox client process and exits shortly after the last client process terminates. The process runs in the background.
