$ AzureStorageEmulator.exe

`AzureStorageEmulator.exe` can be used to emulate the Azure Blob, Queue, and Table services for local development and testing purposes *without* an Azure subscription or incurring Azure usage fees.

The storage smulator is included in the *Microsoft Azure SDK* or can be downloaded separately.


Usage:
code {
AzureStorageEmulator.exe init            : Initialize the emulator database and configuration.
AzureStorageEmulator.exe start           : Start the emulator.
AzureStorageEmulator.exe stop            : Stop the emulator.
AzureStorageEmulator.exe status          : Get current emulator status.
AzureStorageEmulator.exe clear           : Delete all data in the emulator.

{ Emulating Azure Storage Services

  In order to emulate Azure Storage Services, the Storage Emulator uses, if not specified otherwise,
  a  Microsoft SQL Server → development/databases/SQL-Server/versions/2012[2012] → development/databases/SQL-Server/editions[Express LocalDB] → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[instance].

  This instance can be contacted with the name `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDb`, for example with 
code {
C:\> → development/databases/SQL-Server/tools-utilities/sqlcmd -S (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDb
code }

  On this instance, the emulator craeted a → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/database named `AzureStorageEmulatorDb510`. The `510` corresponds to the version of the Storage Emulator.

  { Using a different SQL Server instance

    A different SQL Server instance can be specified like so:
code {
C:\> AzureStorageEmulator.exe init /server <SQLServerInstance>
code }

   The value of `<SQLServerInstance>` can be the dot (`.`) which signifies the *default SQL Server instance*.

  }
