$ %WindowsSdkDir%

The → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/environment-variables[Visual Studio environment variable] `%WindowsSdkDir%` points to the → Windows/development/Kits[Windows kits] directory.

A possible value of this variable might be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10`.

Apparently, the value of `%UniversalCRTSdkDir%` also points to the same directory.
