$ UCRT: argv_data.cpp


This file defines the global data that stores the command line with which the
program was executed, along with the parsed arguments (if the arguments were
parsed), and the accessors for the global data.

The function `__acrt_initialize_command_line()` calls `GetCommandLineA()` and `GetCommandLineW()` and assigns the return value to `_acmdln` and `_wcmdln`.
