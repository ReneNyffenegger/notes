$ cdb.exe

*Symbolic Debugger for Windows*

sa:

  `ntcdb.exe` is identical to `cdb.exe` except that is opens a new console window when it is started. So, in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], the following two lines are equivalent
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/start cdb …
C:\> ntcdb …
code }

{ Suspending (freezing) all threads

  Apparently, it's possible to suspend (freeze) all threads by pressing `ctrl+c`. However, I didn't find this documented, so I am not sure if this is official.
