$ srctool.exe

`srctool.exe` dumps source information from a → Windows/development/Debugging/symbol-files[pdb] or srcsrv stream file
-
For each indexed(!) file, it lists
  • full path
  • source control server
  • file version number

When `srctool.exe` is executed, a pdb, an executable or an srcsrv stream file must be specified on the command line.

Optional parameters:
table { ll
  -u  ☰ Displays only source files that are not indexed.
  -r  ☰ Dumps raw source data from the pdb.
  -s  ☰ Recurses subdirectories.
  -h  ☰ Dumps the hash/checksum of the source file.  It is valid only when the -r or -u option is selected.
  -l:<mask> ☰  Limits output to only source files that match this wildcard expression.
  -lf:<mask> ☰  Same as -l except that the mask is applied only to the filename.  Directory paths are ignored and all are matched.
  -x  ☰ Extracts the files, instead of simply listing them.
  -f  ☰ Extracts files to a flat directory.
  -n  ☰ shows version control commands and output while extracting.
  -d:<dir> ☰  Specifies the directory to extract to.
  -c  ☰ Displays only the count of indexed files - no detail.
  -z  ☰ Returns zero on success or nonzero on failure.
  -o  ☰ Displays the full original version control extraction commands, disabling any VCS-specific output formatting heuristics.
  -a  ☰ Applies all available VCS-specific heuristics to parse the commands and output their contents in some user-friendly way.  Without this flag, only the Source Depot (Microsoft internal) heuristic is applied.
