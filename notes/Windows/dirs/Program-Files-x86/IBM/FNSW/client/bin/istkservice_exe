$ istkservice.exe

`istkservice.exe` implements the Windows Service *ISTKService* which creates the *Global mapped files* required for IBM FileNet ISTK operations.

When this service is started, users without Create Global Objects privilege can execute client applications that link to ISTK libraries.

`istkservice.exe -b` creates two batch files one of which can be used to install the service and the other to uninstall the service.
