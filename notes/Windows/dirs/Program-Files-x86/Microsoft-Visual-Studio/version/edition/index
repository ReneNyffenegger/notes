$ %VSINSTALLDIR%

The → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/environment-variables[Visual Studio environment variable] `%VSINSTALLDIR%` points at the root directory of a
→ Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio] installation.

Beginning with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio] 2017, the path of the root directory includes both, the
→ Windows/development/Visual-Studio/versions[version] *and* → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/editions[edition], aka offering, (such as *professional* or *community*).

Thus, the path to this root directory might be (and with a default installation is):
`→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86[C:\Program Files (x86)]\Microsoft Visual Studio\version\edition`.

Up until version 2015, the root directory was located under `→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-version[%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio V.w]`.

With VS 2017 and later, this root directory can be found with the → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/Installer/vswhere_exe[`vswhere.exe` utility].
