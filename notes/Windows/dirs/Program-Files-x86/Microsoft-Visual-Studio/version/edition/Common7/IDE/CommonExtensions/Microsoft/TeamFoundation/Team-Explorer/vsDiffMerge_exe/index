$ vsDiffMerge.exe

Some command line options *seem* to include:
  • `/ignorecase`
  • `/ignoreeol`
  • `/ignorespace`
  • `/m`


{ Merging non TFS files

  Compare `file-lef.txt` to `file-rigth.txt`, both of which are desencdents of `file-base.txt`:
code {
vsdiffmerge.exe  file-left.txt  file-right.txt  file-base.txt  file-result.txt   /m
code }

  Apparently, in order to run this command from the command line, an instance Visual Studio must already be running.
