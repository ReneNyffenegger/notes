$ listing.inc

`listing.inc` contains assembler macros and is included by the files created with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/F/A[`/FA`] compiler switch to be assembled by
→ Windows/development/Visual-Studio/masm[MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)].

The purpose of `listing.inc` seems to be to define the macro `npad` which can (as I interpret it) be used to align code on a given boundar.
