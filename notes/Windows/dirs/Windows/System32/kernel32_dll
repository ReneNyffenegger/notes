$ kernel32.dll

The *Windows NT BASE API Client → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL]*.

All → Windows/development/process[processes] are guaranteed to have kernel32.dll loaded. This is important because it provides
the two functions `LoadLibrary()` (LoadLibraryA?) which allows the process to load further → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[dlls]
and `GetProcAddress()` with which function pointers (addresses) within newly loaded DLLs can be located.

sa:

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/KernelBase_dll[`KernelBase.dll`]

  `GetUserDefaultLanguageID()`: → Windows/development/Internationalization/language[languages]
