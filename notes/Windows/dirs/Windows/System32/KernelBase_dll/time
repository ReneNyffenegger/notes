$ KernelBase.dll: time

`time` is an → https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/win32/kernelbase/api/index.htm[undocumented function] in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/KernelBase_dll[`KernelBase.dll`] that returns
→ development/date-time/Unix-time (aka → Linux/POSIX time), that is: the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970.

{ Demonstration

  The following simple C program demonstrates the usage of `time`. Because `time` is not found in an import library, its address must be determined with
 `GetModuleHandle` and `GetProcaddress`:

  gh|Windows-development|/KernelBase.dll/time.c||

  I was able to compile this program into a 64-bit executable with → Windows/development/MinGW/w64 using the following command line:
code {
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -nodefaultlibs -nostartfiles -nostdlib .\time.c -luser32 -lkernel32 '-Wl,-estart' -o time.exe
code }

}
