$ KernelBase.dll

*Windows NT BASE API Client DLL*

In order to «improve internal engineering efficiencies and improve foundations for future work», Microsoft has relocated some functionality that was previously found
in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/kernel32_dll[`kernel32.dll`] and → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/advapi32_dll[`advapi.dll`] to a «low level binary»: `KernelBase.dll`.
-
These two → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs] now forward calls down to `KernelBase.dll` rather than handling them directly. This forwarding can be
static (the *export table* shows the redirction) or dynamic at runtime (the DLL has a stub to call the function in `KernelBase.dll`]).
