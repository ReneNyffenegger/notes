$ compact.exe

`compact.exe` displays or alters the compression of files on → Windows/file-system/NTFS partitions.
-
Because compression is an *NTFS feature*, files can be compressed *transparently*, i. e. they don't need to be decompressed manually before using them (this is done in the «background»).

code {
compact [command-line-options] [ filename-1[, filename-2 …]
code }

`compact` can be invoked without command line parameters in which case it simply reports the compression state of the current directory and any files it contains.
-
Wildcards are supported.
-
Multiple filenames and wildcards can be specified.
-
Note that hidden and system files are not displayed by default. `/a` is needed to show them as well.

{ Command line options


  table { ll

    `/c`         ☰ Compresses the specified files. Directories will be marked so that files added afterward will be compressed unless `/exe` is specified.
    `/u`         ☰ Uncompresses the specified files. Directories will be marked so that files added afterward will not be compressed. If `/exe` is specified, only files compressed as executables will be uncompressed; if this is omitted, only NTFS compressed files will be uncompressed.
    `/s:dir`     ☰ Performs the specified operation on files in the given directory and all subdirectories. If omitted, it defaults to the current directory.
    `/a`         ☰ Displays files with the hidden or system attributes. These files are omitted by default.
    `/i`         ☰ Continues performing the specified operation even after errors have occurred. By default, `compact` stops when an error is encountered.
    `/f`         ☰ Forces the compress operation on all specified files, even those which are already compressed. Already-compressed files are skipped by default.
    `/q`         ☰ Reports only the most essential information.
    `/exe:→ #compact-exe-alg[algorithm]` ☰ Specify compression method.
    `/compactOs` ☰ Set or query the system's compression state. Supported options are: `query`: Query the system's Compact state; `always`: Compress all OS binaries and set the system state to *compact* which remains unless administrator changes it; `never`: Uncompress all OS binaries and set the system state to *non-compact* which remains unless administrator changes it.
    `/winDir`    ☰ Used with `/CompactOs:query` when querying the offline OS to secifies the directory where Windows is installed.

{ Supported algorithms #compact-exe-alg

 `compact.exe` supports the following algorithms for the `/exe` parameter:
    • `XPRESS4K` (fastest and also default)
    • `XPRESS8K`
    • `XPRESS16K`
    • `LZX` (most compact)
