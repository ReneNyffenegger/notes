$ taskschd.msc

`taskschd.msc` is the *management console* for the *Task Scheduler*.
-
Many operations that are provided by `taskschd.msc` can also be performed with the command line tool → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/schtasks_exe[`schtasks.exe`]. However, as I found out the
hard way, power (battery) related options cannot be set from `schtasks.exe`.

{ Opening the Task Scheduler from the command line

  The *Task Scheduler* can be opened from the command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell) in one of the following ways:
code {
C:\> taskschd.msc
C:\> taskschd
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[control] schedtasks
code }

}

sa:

  The Windows service → Windows/services/installed/Schedule[Schedule]
