$ where.exe

Find the location of → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executables].

By default, `where.exe` searches executables and scripts in directories that are listed in the → Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[`PATH`]
→ development/environment-variable[environment variable]. By using `/R`, it recursively searches for files below the specified directory.

Where is `where.exe`:
code {
C:\Users\rene> where where
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32[C:\Windows\System32]\where.exe
code }

{ Notes for using where.exe in PowerShell

  There is also a (default) → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[PowerShell alias] `where` for the
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/where[`where-object` cmdLet]. These two `where` commands have nothing to do with each other!

  While `where.exe` is able to locate → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch files (`*.bat`)], it does find
  → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell scripts (`*.ps1`)].
  -
  However, in PowerShell, the location of a PowerShell script can be found like so
code {
(→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/get[get-command] script.ps1).source
code }

}
