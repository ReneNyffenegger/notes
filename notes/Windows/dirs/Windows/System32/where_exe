$ where.exe

Find the location of files.

By default, searches in the `PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable]. By using `/R`, it recursively searches for files below the specified directory.

The → Windows/PowerShell equivalent for `where.exe` seems to be the → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlet] `get-command`.
