$ where.exe

Find the location of executables.

By default, searches in the `PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable]. By using `/R`, it recursively searches for files below the specified directory.

The → Windows/PowerShell equivalent for `where.exe` seems to be the → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdlet] `get-command`.

Note: there is also a (default) → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[PowerShell alias] `where` for the
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/where[`where-object` cmdLet]. These two `where` commands have nothing to do with each other!
