$ Rename a Windows computer (change hostname)

With PowerShell (and admin privileges)
code {
Method execution successful.
Out Parameters:
instance of __PARAMETERS
{
        ReturnValue = 0;
};
code }

This strange syntax (`"…`") is necessary in Powershell to quote the `"`, and the `"` are necessary if the the computername has special characters such as hyphens.

After executing this command, the system needs to be rebooted for the change to take effect.

sa:

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/HOSTNAME_EXE`

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wbem/WMIC_exe/alias/computersystem[`wmic computersystem`]
