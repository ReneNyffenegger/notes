$ WMIC.exe process

Create a → Windows/development/process[process]:
code {
wmic process call create notepad.exe
code }

Query → Windows/development/process[processes] and their process ids:
code {
wmic process get processId,name
wmic process where "name='→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmdkey_exe[cmd.exe]'" get parentProcessId,ProcessId
code }

Terminate a process. (Note, must be executed in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], does not seem to work in → Windows/PowerShell):
code {
wmic process where name="notepad.exe" call terminate
code }


sa:
