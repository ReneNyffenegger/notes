$ attrib.exe

`attrib.exe` displays or changes file or directory attributes.

Each attribute is denoted by a single letter:
table { ll
  R ☰ Read-only file attribute.
  A ☰ Archive file attribute.
  S ☰ System file attribute.
  H ☰ Hidden file attribute.
  O ☰ Offline attribute.
  I ☰ Not content indexed file attribute.
  X ☰ No scrub file attribute.
  V ☰ Integrity attribute.
  P ☰ Pinned attribute.
  U ☰ Unpinned attribute.
  B ☰ SMR Blob attribute.
}

In order to set an attribute, the letter needs to be prended by a plus symbol, to remove it, by a minus symbol:


The following command hides the file `xyz.txt`:
code {
C:\users\rene> attrib +h xyz.txt
code }

The following command makes it visible again:
code {
C:\users\rene> attrib -h xyz.txt
code }


{ Show attributes of files and directories

 `attrib *` shows all files in the current directory along with their attributes.

  In order to also see the attributes of directories, the `/d` option can be used:
code {
C:\Users\rene> attrib /d
codo }

}
