  Note that the Device Manager shows different devices depending on the computer and available devices.

}
{ Starting the Device Manager

  { Via Power User Menu

    The → Windows/keyboard-shortcuts[keyboard shortcut] `windows+x` opens the → Windows/configuration/Power-User-Menu which allows to choose *Device Manager* (key `m`).

  }

  { Command Line

    The device manager can be started in a command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmdkey_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell) by just typing `devmgmt.msc`.

    It can also be started via → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mmc_exe[`mmc.exe`], via → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[`control.exe`] or using → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/rundll32_exe:
code {
C:\> devmgmt.msc
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mmc_exe[mmc] devmgmt.msc
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[control] /name microsoft.deviceManager
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[control] → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/hdwwiz_cpl[hdwwiz.cpl]
C:\> rundll32 → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/devmgr_dll[devmgr.dll] DeviceManager_Execute
code }

  }
  { Windows key

    With Windows-key, then typing *device manager*.

  }

}
{ Updating drivers

  A typical functionality for which the Device Manager might be used is to *update drivers* (as usual using Mouse and left/right clicks):

}
{ Disable Webcam #devmgmt-disable-webcam

  The device manager allows to disable a web cam.

  The web cam is found either under → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/devmgmt_msc/Imaging-devices/Integrated-Camera[Imaging Devices -> Integrated Camera] or *Cameras* -> *Integrated Webcam*

}
{ Environment variable _devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices

  Setting the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `_devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices` to `1` before starting the device manager will cause the device manager to
  *show inactive devices* as well.

}
sa:

  Most (all?) devices are controlled using a driver, of which many (most?, all?) are found in the
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers[`C:\Windows\System32\drivers`] directory.

  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/DRIVERS[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\DRIVERS`]
