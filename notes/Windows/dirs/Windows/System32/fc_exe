     `/A`   ☰ Displays only first and last lines for each set of differences.
     `/B`   ☰ Performs a binary comparison.
     `/C`   ☰ Disregards the case of letters.
     `/L` / `/U`   ☰ Compares files as → development/Unicode/ASCII → development/Unicode text, respectively
     `/LBn` ☰ Sets the maximum consecutive mismatches to the specified number of lines.
     `/N`   ☰ Displays the line numbers on an → development/Unicode/ASCII comparison.
     `/OFF[LINE]` ☰ Do not skip files with offline attribute set.
     `/T` ☰ Does not expand tabs to spaces.
     `/W` ☰ Compresses white space (tabs and spaces) for comparison.
     `/nnnn` ☰ Specifies the number of consecutive lines that must match after a mismatch.

  Apparently, there is no option to recursively compare files.

{ Suppress FC: no differences encountered

 `fc.exe` does not operate silently, that is, unlike the Unix shell command `→ Linux/shell/commands/diff`, it explicitely prints *FC: no differences encountered* even if the two compared files
  are equal.

  However, `fc.exe` sets the exit value to 0 if the files are equal ant to 1 if they differ. Because the exit value can be queried through the variable
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/variables/errorlevel[`%errorlevel%`], this allows to write a → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files which compares two files and
  remains silent if they're equal (by redirecting the output of `fc` to `nul`)
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/echo off
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/set file1=%1
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/set file2=%2

→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/if "%file2%" == "" (echo diff.bat file-1 file-2 && exit /b)

→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/if#cmd-if-exist[if not exist] "%file1%" (echo %file1% does not exist && exit /b)
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/if#cmd-if-exist[if not exist] "%file2%" (echo %file2% does not exist && exit /b)

fc.exe "%file1% "%file2%" > nul
if %errorlevel% neq 0 ( echo %file1% differs from %file2% )
code }

}

sa:

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/comp_exe`

  Some → Microsoft/Office versions come with `→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Microsoft-Office/root/OfficeN/DCF/filecompare_exe` which also allows to compare two text files.
