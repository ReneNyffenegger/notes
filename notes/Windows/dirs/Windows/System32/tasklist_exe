$ tasklist.exe

Lists the currently running → Windows/development/process[tasks] (with their PIDs (process identifiers)).

{ Filtering #tasklist-fi

  With the `/FI` option, specific processes can be queried for (filtered).

  For example, the following command finds all processes that start with `note` (such as `notepad.exe`):
code {
C:\> tasklist /fi "imagename eq note*"
code }

  The wildcard (`*`) seems to only work at the end of the identifier, not at its beginning.
