$ Using winsqlite3.dll with PowerShell

→ Windows/versions/10 comes with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll[`winsqlite3.dll`], a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL that hosts the interface
of the → development/databases/SQLite C API.

With → Microsoft/dot-net#dot-net-pinvoke, it is possible to access such API from → Windows/PowerShell.

Because I once had to work in a Windows environment where I was not allowed to install *anything* and had no access to a
→ development/databases[database], but needed a database anyway, I was forced to write such an SQLite wrapper so that I could store my data in a database.

The sources are hosted in → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/winsqlite3.dll-PowerShell[this Github repository] and consist of
  • → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll/PInvoke_ps1[`PInvoke.ps1`]: the wrappers for SQLite API
  • → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/winsqlite3_dll/classes.ps1[`classes.ps1`]: two classes, `sqliteDB` and `sqliteStmt`
  • `test.ps1`: a simple script to the functionality of the previous to files

{ PInvoke.ps1
