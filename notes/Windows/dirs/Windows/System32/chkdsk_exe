*Check Disk Utility*

code {
chkdsk [volume[[path]filename]]] [options…]

  • volume name

`[path]filename` specifies the file to check for fragmentation (FAT, FAT32 only)

{ Options


   table { ll

      `/F`                  ☰ Take volume offline to scan it and fix errors on the disk. Equivalent to `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/volume/repair -offlineScanAndFix`
      `/V`                  ☰ FAT/FAT32: Display full path and name of every file on the disk. → Windows/file-system/NTFS: Displays cleanup messages if any.
      `/R`                  ☰ Locate bad sectors and recover readable information (implies `/F` when `/scan` not specified).
      `/L:size`             ☰ NTFS only: Change the log file size to the specified number of kilobytes. If size is not specified, displays current size.
      `/X`                  ☰ Forcs the volume to dismount first if necessary. All opened handles to the volume would then be invalid (implies `/F`).
      `/I`                  ☰ NTFS only: Perform a less vigorous check of index entries.
      `/C`                  ☰ NTFS only: Skip checking of cycles within the folder structure.
      `/B`                  ☰ NTFS only: Re-evaluate bad clusters on the volume (implies `/R`)
      `/scan`               ☰ NTFS only: Run an online scan on the volume without attempting to repair it. Equivalent to `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/volume/repair -scan`.
      `/forceofflinefix`    ☰ NTFS only: Bypass all online repair; all defects found are queued for offline repair (i. e. `chkdsk /spotfix`). Must be used with `/scan`.
      `/perf`               ☰ NTFS only: (Must be used with "/scan") Use more system resources to complete a scan as fast as possible. This may have a negative performance impact on other tasks running on the system.
      `/spotfix`            ☰ NTFS only: Take the volume briefly offline and then fix the issues logged in the `$corrupt` file (this process is referred to as *spot fixing*). Equivalent to `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/volume/repair -spotfix`.
      `/sdcleanup`          ☰ Garbage collect unneeded security descriptor data (implies `/F`).
      `/offlinescanandfix`  ☰ Runs an offline scan and fix on the volume.
      `/freeorphanedchains` ☰ FAT/FAT32/exFAT only: Free any orphaned cluster chains instead of recovering their contents.
      `/markclean`          ☰ FAT/FAT32/exFAT only: Mark the volume clean if no corruption was detected, even if `/F` was not specified.
