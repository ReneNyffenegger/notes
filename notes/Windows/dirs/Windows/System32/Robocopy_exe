$ Robocopy.exe

*Copy files and directory trees*

code {
ROBOCOPY source destination [file [file]…] [options]
code }


The parent directory of the directory into which Robocopy is supposed to copy a source tree to must already exist, apparently there is switch to make Robocopy create such a folder.

{ Command line options

  A very useful command line option is `/L`: it lists the files that match the criterias without copying them. Thus, this flag might be used to double check if an operation corresponds to the
  desired outcome.

  { Copy options 

    table { ll
      `/S` ☰ copy Subdirectories, but not empty ones (S stands for subdirectories)
      `/E` ☰ copy subdirectories, including empty ones (E stands for empty)
      `/LEV:n` ☰ only copy the top n LEVels of the source directory tree.

      `/Z` ☰ copy files in restartable mode.
      `/B` ☰ copy files in Backup mode.
      `/ZB` ☰ use restartable mode; if access denied use Backup mode.
      `/J` ☰ copy using unbuffered I/O (recommended for large files).
      `/EFSRAW` ☰ copy all encrypted files in EFS RAW mode.
      `/COPY:copyflag[s]` ☰ what to COPY for files (default is `/COPY:DAT`).  (copyflags : D=Data, A=Attributes, T=Timestamps, X=Skip alt data streams).  (S=Security=NTFS ACLs, O=Owner info, U=aUditing info).
      `/SEC` ☰ copy files with SECurity (equivalent to `/COPY:DATS`).
      `/COPYALL` ☰ COPY ALL file info (equivalent to `/COPY:DATSOU`).
      `/NOCOPY` ☰ COPY NO file info (useful with `/PURGE`).
      `/SECFIX` ☰ FIX file SECurity on all files, even skipped files.
      `/TIMFIX` ☰ FIX file TIMes on all files, even skipped files.
      `/PURGE` ☰ delete dest files/dirs that no longer exist in source.
      `/MIR` ☰ MIRror a directory tree (equivalent to `/E` plus `/PURGE`).
      `/MOV` ☰ MOVe files (delete from source after copying).
      `/MOVE` ☰ MOVE files AND dirs (delete from source after copying).
      `/A+:[RASHCNET]` ☰ add the given Attributes to copied files.
      `/A-:[RASHCNET]` ☰ remove the given Attributes from copied files.
      `/CREATE` ☰ CREATE directory tree and zero-length files only.
      `/FAT` ☰ create destination files using 8.3 FAT file names only.
      `/256` ☰ turn off very long path (> 256 characters) support.
      `/MON:n` ☰ MONitor source; run again when more than n changes seen.

      `/SL` ☰ copy Symbolic Links as links instead of as the link targets.
      `/MT[:n]` ☰ Do multi-threaded copies with n threads (default 8).  n must be at least 1 and not greater than 128.  This option is incompatible with the /IPG and /EFSRAW options. Redirect output using `/LOG` option for better performance.
      `/DCOPY:copyflag[s]` ☰ what to COPY for directories (default is `/DCOPY:DA`). (copyflags : D=Data, A=Attributes, T=Timestamps, E=EAs, X=Skip alt data streams).

{ Recursively compare files

  According to → https://superuser.com/a/748518[this superuser] answer, robocopy can be used to recursively compare files that differ by timestamp or size (but not by content!?) like so:
code {
robocopy.exe source target /l /e /zb
code }

}

sa:
  The → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/copy[`cmd.exe` built-in command `copy`] and
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/xcopy_exe[`xcopy.exe`]

  The Linux shell command `→ Linux/shell/commands/rsync`

  Apparently, `robocopy.exe` also comes with the *Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools*, see → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Resource-Kits/Tools.
