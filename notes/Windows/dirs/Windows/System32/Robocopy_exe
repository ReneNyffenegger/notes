{ Copy directory structure, but only certain file types

code {
robocopy S:\ource\dir  D:\estination\dir *.docx *.xlsx /s
code }

}
{ Recursively compare files

  According to → https://superuser.com/a/748518[this superuser] answer, robocopy can be used to recursively compare files that are different by timestamp or size (but not by content!?) like so:
code {
robocopy.exe source target /l /e /zb
code }

}
