$ sqlceoledb40.dll

Microsoft SQL Server Compact → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider for Windows.

The interesting thing about this → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL is that there is the
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId[ProgId] *Microsoft.WINDOWS.SQLLITE.OLEDB.4.0* with the
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID[CLSID] `{3BE786A0-0366-4F5C-9434-25CF162E475E}` which points to the *InProcServer32* `sqlceoledb40`.

So, the question is if this DLL is *also*(?) used for an → development/databases/SQLite data source.
