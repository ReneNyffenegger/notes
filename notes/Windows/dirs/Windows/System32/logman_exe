$ logman.exe

*Performance Log Utility*

`logman.exe` creates and manages *Event Trace Session* and *Performance* logs.

Many functions of the *Performance Montitor* are available from the command line through `logman.exe`.

A common scenario that `logman.exe` is used for is to capture *baseline performance data* for a system.

Collected data, typically stored in a file with an → development/filename-extensions#etl[`.etl`] extension, can then be analyzed, for example, with
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/tracerpt_exe[`tracerpt.exe`].
