$ RstrtMgr.dll

`RstrtMgr.dll` implements the *Restart Manager*.

The Restart Manager makes it possible to shut down and restart applications which are using a file you want to update.

{ Using the Restart Manager to find processes that have a specific file open

  See also the function → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/filesystem/get-openFileProcess[`get-openFileProcess`] of the
  → Windows/PowerShell/modules/personal/filesystem[PowerShell module `filesystem`].
