{ Some interesting tabs

  { Disabling services #msconfig-exe-disable-services

    The *Services* tab allows to disable a number of services with simple un-ticking them.

   `msconfig.exe` stores the time and date of the modification as well as the original startup type (manual or automatic) under
    the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] under a subkey below
    → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Shared-Tools/MSConfig/services[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSConfig\services`].
    -
    So they can be enabled again later to their original startup type.

  }
  { Show non-Microsoft services only #msconfig-exe-non-ms-services

    The *Services* tab has a checkbox that can be checked to *Hide all Microsoft → Windows/services[services]*.

  }
  { Limiting memory and number of processors #msconfig-exe_limit-memory-cpu

    The number of → hardware/CPU[processors] and the size of → Windows/development/memory[memory] can be limitted in *advanced options* in the *boot* tab:
