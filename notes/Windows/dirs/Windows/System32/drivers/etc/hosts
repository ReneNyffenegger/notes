$ %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

The *hosts* file allows to assign aliases (host names) to → development/networking/IP#ip-address[IP addresses].
-
The host name can then be used in lieu of an IP address where an IP address is expected, for example in
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/PING_EXE[`PING.EXE`].
-
The values in a host file are especially useful to give a server a name if the server is not known by the DNS server. On the other hand, this method breaks if the server's address
changes and the host file is not updated.

The format of the hosts file is IP address followed by a host name.

Comments can be started with the `#` symbol.

code {
#
#  Test server
#
192.168.110.11 omega
code }

With such an entry, the server can be contacted like so
code {
C:\> ping omega

Pinging omega [192.168.110.11] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.110.11: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
…
code }

If the mapped server is a → web/webserver, the web server can then be reached with the URL `https://omega/`

{ Windows Subsystem for Linux

  In → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux[WSL], `→ Linux/fhs/etc/hosts` inherits the entries from the Windows `hosts` file.

}

  `→ Linux/fhs/etc/hosts`
