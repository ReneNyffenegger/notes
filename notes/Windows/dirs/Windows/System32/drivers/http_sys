$ http.sys

`http.sys` is the *kernel mode listener* for all → development/web/HTTP trafic on Windows.

In the case of IIS, it listens for → development/web/HTTP#http-request[HTTP requests] from the network, passes the requests to → Windows/optional-features/IIS[IIS] for processing and then returns processed responses to client browsers.

sa:

  The .NET class `→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Net/HttpListener` is built on `http.sys`.

  With `HttpCfg.exe`, it is possible to configure the HTTP Server API (IP Listen List, SSL Certificates, Namespace reservation).
