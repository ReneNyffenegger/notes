$ cmd.exe /c | /k

When `cmd.exe` is started, it can be given either the `/c` or `/k` flag along with a command to be executed.

With `/c`, the newly started cmd.exe process runs the given command and then terminates *itself*.
-
With `/k`, the newly started cmd.exe process runs the given command and then remains running, waiting for further input.

code {
cmd /k date /t
exit
