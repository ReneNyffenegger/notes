$ cmd.exe - file and directory name completion

If → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] is started with the `/f:on` (or simply `/f`) → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe#cmd-exe-options[option], the names of files and directores can be completed by
(repeatedly) pressing a specific character.

By default, the character to complete directories is `ctrl-d`, the character to complete files is `ctrl-f`.

In → Windows/versions/10,  `ctrl-f` is also the character to search for text *if* *Enable Ctrl key shurtcuts* is enabled. In that case, `ctrl-f` cannot be used to search for text.

The character that triggers filename and directory completion can be be changed in the → Windows/registry[registry] in the values
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Command-Processor#reg-command-processor-completion[`CompletionChar` and `PathCompletionChar`] below the registry key
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Command-Processor[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`].
