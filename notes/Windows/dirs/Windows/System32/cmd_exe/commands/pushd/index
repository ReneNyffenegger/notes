$ cmd.exe - pushd
@ pushd

`pushd dir-name` pushes the current directory (→ development/environment-variable#cd[`%CD%`]) onto the *directory stack* and → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/cd[`cd`s] into the directory given as parameter (`dir-name`).

The opposite command is → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/popd[popd] which gets and removes the most recently directory name off the directory stack and `cd`s back to that directory.

`pushd` is affected by whether → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled or disabled.

{ Showing pushd directory stack

  Without arguments, `pushd` lists the directory names that are alread stored on the directory stack.

  When the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/variables/PROMPT[environment variable `%PROMPT%`] contains a `$+`, each level of pushed directories is replaced with a `+` in the printed prompt in
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe].
