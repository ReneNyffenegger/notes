{ Create symbolic links

  By default, `mklink` creates → Windows/file-system/NTFS#ntfs-links[symbolic links in NTFS].

  *administrator privileges* are requried to create a symbolic link unless Windows is put into → Windows/development/developer-mode[developer mode].

  The following example uses → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/echo[`echo`] and the redirection operator (`>`) to create a file (`target.txt`) whose content is *Some Text*. Then, a symbolic link
  is created with `mklink`. Using → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/type[`type`] on `sym.link` shows the same content as is in `target.txt`:
