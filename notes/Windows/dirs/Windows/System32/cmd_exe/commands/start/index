$ cmd.exe - start
@ start

Run another program or command from → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`].

{ Starting another cmd.exe

  `start` can be used to start another instance of `cmd.exe`:

code {
start cmd
code }

  When another `cmd.exe` is started it can be passed a command to be executed with the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/options/c_k[`/c` or `/k`] option.
  -
  Usually, the `/k` is preferrable because the result of the command will be still visible after the command is run. (`/c` terminates the newly started cmd.exe → Windows/development/process[process].

code {
start cmd.exe date /t
code }


}
{ Starting applications that are not in PATH

  Applications that are »registered« under the → Windows/registry[registry] key
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/App-Paths[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths`] are
  found even though their executable is not found via the
  → Windows/development/environment-variables#win-envvar-path[`%PATH%`] environment variable.

  It seems to me that this is possible because `start` uses → Windows/development/WinAPI/Shell#winapi-ShellExecuteEx[the WinAPI/Shell function `ShellExecuteEx()`] behind the scenes.

}
{ Starting executables whose path contains spaces

  Using `start` to run an executable whose path contains spaces, the path needs to be enclosed in quotes.
  
  However, if the start command encounters quotes, it interpretes them as a title. Thus, a (possibly) empty title needs
  to be given in order to start the following executable:

code {
start "" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\OUTLOOK.EXE"
code }

}
{ Using PATHEXT

 `start` uses the environment variable → Windows/development/environment-variables#win-envvar-pathext[`PATHEXT`] to determine the suffix of an executable of script
  if it was started without suffix.

}
{ Quickly opening folders below a directory in %PATH%

  Directories immediatly below a directory in `%PATH%` can be opened in explorer by typing `start` plus the name of the directory. For example, to open the → Windows/dirs/Windows/Fonts[`Fonts`] folder (which is usually below
→ Windows/dirs/Windows[`C:\Windows`], the following command might do:
code {
C:\> start fonts
code }

  In order to open the explorer and display the current directory, the dot can be used:
code {
C:\> start .
code }

}
{ shell:::{GUID}

  A special syntax allows to open(?) a → development/UUID-GUID[GUID]. For example, the following opens something that is related to printers:
code {
start shell:::{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}
code }

}

sa:

  `start` is affected by whether → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled or disabled.
