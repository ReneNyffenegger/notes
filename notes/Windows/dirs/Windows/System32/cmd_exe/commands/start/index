{ Using PATHEXT

 `start` uses the environment variable → Windows/development/environment-variables#win-envvar-pathext[`PATHEXT`] to determine the suffix of an executable of script
  if it was started without suffix.


}
{ Starting applications that are not in PATH

  Applications that are »registered« under the → Windows/registry[registry] key
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/App-Paths[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths`] are
  found even though their executable is not found via the
  → Windows/development/environment-variables#win-envvar-path[`%PATH%`] environment variable.

}
{ Quickly opening folders below a directory in %PATH%

  Directories immediatly below a directory in `%PATH%` can be opened in explorer by typing `start` plus the name of the directory. For example, to open the `fonts` folder (that usually is below
→ Windows/dirs/Windows[`C:\Windows`], the following command might do:
code {
C:\> start fonts
code }

In order to open the explorer at the current directory, the dot can be used:
code {
C:\> start .
code }

}

sa:

  `start` is affected by wheather → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled or disabled.
