{ Quickly opening folders below a directory in %PATH%

  Directories immediatly below a directory in `%PATH%` can be opened in explorer by typing `start` plus the name of the directory. For example, to open the `fonts` folder (that usually is below
→ Windows/dirs/Windows[`C:\Windows`], the following command might do:
code {
C:\> start fonts
code }

In order to open the explorer at the current directory, the dot can be sued:
code {
C:\> start .
code }

}

  `start` is affected by wheather → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled or disabled.
