$ cmd.exe: for /f "tokens=…"

This page tries to demonstrate how the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/for/f[`for /f`] `tokens=…` option influences the splitting of text into tokens and assigning them to
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/variables[variables].

A series of seven words (`one   two  three four five    six seven`) is assigned to the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/variables[variable] `%text%`.

The `for /f` is then applied on this variable. The `tokens=…` option assigns the specified tokens  to the `%%A` and following variables (`%%B`, `%%C` …).
-
In order to show which value was assigned to which variable, the variables `A` through `E` are printed after splitting `%text%` into tokens.

Because the `for /f …` command is in a → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`batch file`] the variables `%%A` and so on need to have
two percent signs. If the command were entered directly into the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] console, prefixing them with one
`%` sign would be sufficient.


{ tokens=*

  With `tokens=*`, all tokens, that is: the entire text, is assigned to *one* variable.

  gh|about-cmd.exe|/commands/for/f/tokens/star.bat||

  The script prints:
code {
A = one   two  three four five    six seven
B = %B
C = %C
D = %D
E = %E
code }

}
{ tokens=3*

  With `tokens=3*`, the first two tokens are skipped, the third token is assigned to the first variable and the rest to the second variable:

  gh|about-cmd.exe|/commands/for/f/tokens/3star.bat||

code {
A = three
B = four five    six seven
C = %C
D = %D
E = %E
code }

}
{ tokens=1-4*

  With `tokens=1-4*`, the first four tokens are assigned to the first four variables (`%%A` through `%%D`) and the rest is assigned to the next (in this case: the fifth) variable:

  gh|about-cmd.exe|/commands/for/f/tokens/1-4star.bat||

code {
A = one
B = two
C = three
D = four
E = five    six seven
code }

}
{ tokens=1-4,*

 `tokens=1-4,*` behaves exactly as `tokens=1-4*` does. So, the comma in front of the asterisk does not change any meaning.
  gh|about-cmd.exe|/commands/for/f/tokens/1-4commaStar.bat||

code {
A = one
B = two
C = three
D = four
E = five    six seven
code }

}
{ tokens=2,4,5

  With `tokens=2,4,5`, only the second, forth and fifth tokens are assigned. The rest is ommited.

code {
A = two
B = four
C = five
D = %D
E = %E
code }

}
{ tokens=2,4,5,*

 `tokens=2,4,5, *` again assigns the second, fourth and fifth token. The star assigns everything after the fifth token to the next (here: the fourth) variable:
  gh|about-cmd.exe|/commands/for/f/tokens/2_4_5_star.bat||

code {
A = two
B = four
C = five
D = six seven
E = %E
code }

}
