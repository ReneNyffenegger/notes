$ cmd.exe - rmdir
@ rmdir

`rmdir` deletes directories. `rm` stands for remove.

code {
C:\> rmdir p:\ath\to\directory
code }

`rmdir` won't remove a non-empty directory unless `/s` is specified:
code {
c:\> rdmir /s p:\ath\of\non\empty\directory
p:\ath\of\non\empty\directory, Are you sure (Y/N)?
code }

In order to prevent the *Are you sure (Y/N)* question, the `/q` (quiet) flag needs also to be specified. This is especially useful in
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch files] because this question stops the execution from proceeding.
code {
c:\> rdmir /q /s p:\ath\of\non\empty\directory
code }


sa:

  Use → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/del[`del`] to delete files.

  The Linux Shell command → Linux/shell/commands/rmdir[with the same name].
