$ cmd.exe - dir
@ dir

Show the files and → Windows/file-system/directories[directories] in a given directory or the current directory

{ Sort files and directories #cmd-exe-dir-sort

 `dir /ox` sorts the listed files. `x` specifies the sorting criteria:
table { ll
  `n` ☰ alphabetically
  `e` ☰ → development/filename-extensions[filename extension]
  `s` ☰ size
  `d` ☰ modification time and date
  `g` ☰ show group directories first
table }

  If the sorting criteria letter is prepended with a dash, the sorting order is reversed. The following command shows
  the newest files/directories first:
code {
C:\Users\Rene> dir /o-d
code }

}
{ Display owner of files and directories

  The owner of files and directories is shown with `/q`:
code {
dir /q → Windows/dirs/Windows[%SystemRoot%]
code }

}
{ Show junctions #cmd-exe-dir-al

  `dir /al` shows junctions (aka *reparse points*).

}
{ Environment variable DIRCMD #cmd-exe-dircmd

  The → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variable] `DIRCMD` controls the default options given to `dir`.

  It might be set, for example, to `/ogn /a` to always show the directories first and sort by file/directory name and to show *all* (including hidden) files.
