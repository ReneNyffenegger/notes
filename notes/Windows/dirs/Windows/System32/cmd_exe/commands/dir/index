$ cmd.exe - dir
@ dir

`dir` lists files and → Windows/file-system/directories[directories] in a given directory or the current directory:

{ Options

  `dir` accepts the following options:
  table { ll
  
    `/A`,  `/Ax`, `/A-x` ☰ `/A`: Show all files, `/Ax`: include files with attribute `x` in listing, `/A-x`: exclude files with attribute `x` (→ #cmd-exe-dir-attr[See below] for `x`)
    `/B`  ☰ Use *bare format*, that is: only show file and directory name, without their sizes and/or creation date
    `/C`, `/-C` ☰ Show, don't show thousand separator in file sizes (`/C` is default)
    `/D`, `/W` ☰ Wide (multi-column) format. `/D` sorts file first in left most column, `/W` sorts from top to bottom, then from left to right
    `/L` ☰ Print file names in lowercase
    `/-N` ☰ Show filenames to the left (`/N` is default)
    `/Ox` ☰ Sort files according to → #cmd-exe-dir-sort[criterion `x`]
    `/P` ☰ Paginate output
    `/Q` ☰ Print file owner
    `/R` ☰ Include alternate data streams of file
    `/T:x` ☰ Specify displayed time field (`x`) for displaying or sorting (`c`: creation, `a`: last acess, `w`: last written) 
    `/X` ☰ Show short file names
    `/4` ☰ Use 4-digit year (is this not the default anyway.

  table }

{
{ Environment variable DIRCMD #cmd-exe-dircmd

  The → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variable] `DIRCMD` controls the default options given to `dir`.

  It might be set, for example, to `/ogn /a` to always show the directories first and sort by file/directory name and to show *all* (including hidden) files.

}
{ Sort files and directories #cmd-exe-dir-sort

 `dir /ox` sorts the listed files. `x` specifies the sorting criteria:
table { ll
  `n` ☰ alphabetically
  `e` ☰ → development/filename-extensions[filename extension]
  `s` ☰ size
  `d` ☰ modification time and date
  `g` ☰ show group directories first
table }

  If the sorting criteria letter is prepended with a dash, the sorting order is reversed. The following command shows
  the newest files/directories first:
code {
C:\Users\Rene> dir /o-d
code }

}
{ Include / exclude files with specific attributes #cmd-exe-dir-attr
  
  `/Ax` includes, `/A-x` excludes files with a given attribute `x`. `/A` shows *all* files, no matter what their attributes.

  The possible values for `x` are:
  table { ll
    `d` ☰ Directories
    `h` ☰ Hidden files
    `s` ☰ System files
    `l` ☰ → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points[Reparse points]
    `r` ☰ Read-only files
    `a` ☰ Files ready for archiving
    `i` ☰ Not content indexed files
    `o` ☰ Offline files
  table }

  Attributes can be set or removed with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/attrib_exe[`attrib.exe`].


}
{ Display owner of files and directories

  The owner of files and directories is shown with `/q`:
code {
dir /q → Windows/dirs/Windows[%SystemRoot%]
code }

}
{ Show junctions #cmd-exe-dir-al

  `dir /al` shows junctions (aka *reparse points*).

}
