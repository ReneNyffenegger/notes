$ cmd.exe - rem
@ rem

{ Usage of rem

  `rem` can be used to add comment lines to → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch files].

}
{ rem is a command

 `rem` is a «real» built-in command.

  This can be demonstrated with the following simple batch file:
    • The `/?` is not interpreted as comment but rather as a request for help on `rem`.
    • The → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/echo[`echo`] command is ended with the `&&` and, if successful, the next command (`rem`) is evauluated.

  gh|about-cmd.exe|/commands/rem/built-in.bat||

  When executed, the batch file prints:
code {
Records comments (remarks) in a batch file or CONFIG.SYS.

REM [comment]
code }

}
{ Using double colons

  An unofficial (and sometimes problematic) way to comment lines is to use double colons (`::`) because it might be
  visually easier to read.

  A particular problem of `::` occurs when used within `( … )`:
