$ cmd.exe: the echo command

{ Four basic usages of echo

 `echo` has four basic usages:
   • `echo some text` to print `some text` to the console
   • `echo off` to turn off command echoing, compare with the `/q` → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe#cmd-exe-options[options].
   • `echo on` to turn on command echoing
   • `echo` to show if command echoing is turned off or on

}
{ Printing empty lines

 `echo` prints an empty line if the command is followed by a colon:

  As per some answers and comments in → https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132799[this stackoverflow thread], the only (?) safe way is to use `echo(`.

  With `echo(`, it's also possible to print *indented text*:
code {
@echo(     1
@echo(    1 1
@echo(   1 2 1
@echo(  1 3 3 1
@echo( 1 4 6 4 1
code }

}
