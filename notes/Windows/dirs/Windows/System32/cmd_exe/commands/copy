$ cmd.exe - copy
@ copy

`copy` as a → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands[built-in command of `cmd.exe`] to copy files from one directory to another.

{ Copy one file

  The following command copies one file (`a_file.txt`) into the directory `p:\ath\to\destination\directory`. `a_file.txt` must be located in the *current directory*.
code {
C:\users\rene> copy a_file.txt p:\ath\to\destination\directory
code }

  If the destination does not refer to a directory, it is interrpreted as a new name for the file (thus
  the file is copied *and renamed*):
  
code {
c:\users\rene> copy another_file.txt p:\ath\to\destination\directory\renamed_file.txt
code }

}
{ No creation of directories

  If the destination directory does not exist, it won't be created. Rather, an error message is displayed (
code {
c:\users\rene> copy hello.txt p:\ath\to\inexsting\directory\file.txt
The system cannot find the path specified.
        0 file(s) copied.
code }


}
{ Using source paths

  The source file can also be given with a path, relative or absolute: 
code {
C:\users\rene> copy %appdata%\prg\file p:\ath\to\destination
code }

}
{ Copying multiple files

  Mulitple files can be copied in *one* command, however only to the same destination directory.
code {
C:\users\rene> copy %appdata%\prg\* p:\ath\to\destination
code }

}
{ Using wildcards

  Of course, wildcards are possible. The following command copies all files in `src` whose → development/filename-extensions[extension] is `foo` to the directory `dest`.
code {
C:\users\rene> copy src\*.foo dest
code }

  If the wildcard is used twice, the files are copied *and* their suffix renamed*.
code {
C:\users\rene> copy *.txt *.txt.save
code }

}

{ Updating a file's timestamp #cmd-exe-update-timestamp

  The following command updates a file's timestamp, much as → Linux/shell/commands/touch[`touch`] on Unix does.
  However, it won't create the file if it does not exist.
code {
c:\> copy someFile.txt +,,
code }

}
{ Options

  table { ll
   `/A` | `/B` ☰  Indicates an ASCII text | binary file.
   `/D`        ☰  Allow the destination file to be created decrypted destination  Specifies the directory and/or filename for the new file(s).
   `/V`        ☰  Verifies that new files are written correctly.
   `/N`        ☰  Uses short filename, if available, when copying a file with a non-8dot3 name.
   `/Y` | `/-Y`☰  Suppresses | causes prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
   `/Z`        ☰  Copies networked files in restartable mode.
   `/L`        ☰  If the source is a symbolic link, copy the link to the target instead of the actual file the source link points to.
  table }

  The `COPYCMD` → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variable]

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/xcopy_exe[`xcopy.exe`] to copy entire directory structures. Contrary to `copy`, `xcopy` is not a built-in command of → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] but a «real»
  → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executable]

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ro

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands
