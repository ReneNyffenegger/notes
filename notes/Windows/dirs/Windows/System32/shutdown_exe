$ shutdown.exe

*Shutdown and annotation tool*.

{ Shutdown the computer

  `/t 0` specifies the time in seconds (`/t 0` = immediatly).

  `/s` means the computer.

code {
C:\> shutdown /s /t 0
code }

   The command might be augmented with `/f` to *force* all applications to be closed.

}
{ Hibernate the computer

  The `/h` option allows to hibernate a computer from the command line (→ Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe] or → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell):
code {
C:\> shutdown /h
code }

}
{ Shutdown and restart

  Use `/r` rather than `/s`:
code {
C:\> shutdown /r /t 0
code }


}
