$ certutil.exe -hashfile

`→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/certutil_exe -hashfile` calculates the cryptographic hash of a file. It supports the following algorithms:
  • MD2
  • MD4
  • MD5
  • SHA1
  • SHA256
  • SHA384
  • SHA512

By default, it calucluates the SHA1 hash:
code {
C:\> certutil.exe -hashfile xyz.txt
SHA1 hash of .\xyz.txt
90512edc54cbadf7165648753a3306663a73bd56
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
code }

In order to calculate a different hash value, the algorithm is specified after their filename:
code {
C:\> certutil.exe -hashfile xyz.txt MD5
MD% hash of .\xyz.txt

CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
code }
