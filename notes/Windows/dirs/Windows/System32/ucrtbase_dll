$ ucrtbase.dll

In → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio] 2015, the → Windows/development/CRT[CRT] was split into two parts
  • UCRT: which contains compiler independent components (such as the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc[standard c library], → Linux/POSIX extensions etc))
  • vcruntime for compiler-specific functionality (code for program startup, exception handling, → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/intrinsic[intrinsics])
 
`ucrtbase.dll` contains the UCRT and ships as operating system component with and since → Windows/versions/10[Windows 10].

The source code for the UCRT is installed along with Visual Studio, by default under
  `C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Include\sdk-version\ucrt`. The `sdk-version` corresponds to a → Windows/versions[version] (for example 10.0.1.14393.0 for the *Anniversary update*).
  
The corresponding (architecture dependent) `*.lib` are under
  `C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\bin\architecture\ucrt` (with, for example, x64 for architecture).

The redistributable (that is: non-debug) DLLs itself are under
  `C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Redist\ucrt\DLLs\architecture`.

{ Misc

  The UCRT is the → Windows equivalent of → Linux[Linux's] *glibc*.

}
sa:
  The source code for the UCRT is stored in the → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/Source/version/ucrt[`%UniversalCRTSdkDir%\Source\%UCRTVersion%`] directory.
  -
  The include files to use the UCRT are in → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/Include/version[`%UniversalCRTSdkDir%\Include\%UCRTVersion%`]

  Compare with the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ucrtbase_dll[`ucrtbase_dll` that is found in an Office installation].
