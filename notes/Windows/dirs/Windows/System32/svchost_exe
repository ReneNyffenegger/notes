$ svchost.exe

svchost.exe runs → Windows/services[services].

When → Windows starts up, `svchost.exe` starts the services it finds in the → Windows/registry[registry] under the key
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-NT/CurrentVersion/Svchost[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost`].
-
But see also the value of → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/_driver_name_#reg-services-imagePath[`ImagePath`]
under a driver's corresponding → Windows/registry[registry] key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/_driver_name_[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\driverName`].

? In order to save system resources `svchost.exe` combines several services into one process (which probably explains why some (all?) services are written as DLLs).

{ -k #svchost_exe-k

  `svchost.exe` can be started with `-k xyz`. In such cases, `xyz` seems to correspond to a value *and* a → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] below the registry key
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-NT/CurrentVersion/Svchost[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost`]

{ TODO

  The following PowerShell command seems to produce a list of services that are started using `svchost.exe`:
code {
get-cimInstance -className Win32_Service | where {$_.pathname -match 'c:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe'}|select name, pathname
code }

}
