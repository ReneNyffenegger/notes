$ sc.exe

→ Windows/services[Service] Control Manager Configuration Tool

{ Insufficient buffer size returned FAILED 122

  At times, `sc.exe` fails with an error message that the buffer size was too small:

code {
C:\Windows\system32>sc qprivs beep
[SC] GetConfigInfo: Insufficient buffer size returned FAILED 122:

The data area passed to a system call is too small.

[SC] GetConfigInfo needs 8 bytes
   … …
code }

  So, we specifically add a buffer size to the command: same command, but buffer size of 8 appended (error was `GetConfigInfo needs 8 bytes`):
code {
C:\Windows\system32>sc qprivs beep 8
[SC] QueryServiceConfig2 SUCCESS


SERVICE_NAME: beep
        PRIVILEGES       :
code }

  There's also the `bufsize=` option, but this does not really seem to work in this case.

  Note that → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] has an → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias[alias] `sc` for `set-content`. Thus, in order to use `sc` from a PowerShell
  command line, it needs to be invoked with its suffix, `sc.exe`.
