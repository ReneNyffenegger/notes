$ conhost.exe

Console Windows Host

The *console host* controls the appearance and functionality of *character mode* applications such as → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe or → Windows/PowerShell. Such character mode
applications are also referred to as *consoles*.

{ Creating a conhost.exe child process

  In the original Windows → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem design, console windows were managed by
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/csrss_exe[`csrss.exe`].

  This design changed in → Windows/versions/7 where for each console (→ Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe]) a separate process (`conhost.exe`) is spawned as child process.

}
{ Configuring settings #conhost_exe-settings

  The settings of the console host are taken from various places:
     • Hardcoded values in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ConhostV1_dll[`ConhostV1.dll`] (or `conhostv2.dll`?)
     • → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/console[`HKCU\Console`]
     • Subkeys of → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/console[`HKCU\Console`] (where the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[key name] is either the exe path of the console application (backslashes replace by underscores) or the application's title
     • Windows shortcut files (→ development/filename-extensions#lnk[`*.lnk`])

  A list of settings that can be adjustes is → https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/understanding-windows-console-host-settings/[here].

  When an application is started through a `*.lnk` file, the values in the subkey of `HKCU\Console` are irrelevant.

  The menu of an application that uses `conhost.exe` (such as → Windows/PowerShell in the following picture) contains the two entries *Defaults* and *Properties*.
  -
  Choosing *Defaults* allows to change the settings that are stored in `HKCU\Console` while *Properties* allows to change the settings in either the subkey of that registry key or the `*.lnk` file.
