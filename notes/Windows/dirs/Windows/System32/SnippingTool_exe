$ SnippingTool.exe

`SnippingTool.exe` is a program with which screenshots can be taken.
-
The tool provides four types of screenshots:
  • Free-form: the area is selected by moving the mouse around it
  • A rectangle which is defined by selecting its opposite corners with the mouse
  • The area of a specific window
  • Full screen

This EXE is referenced under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/App-Paths[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths`].

Update *2024-01-19*: On a Windows 11 machine, I've found `SnippingTool.exe` not under `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32` but under `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps`.

{ Mouse pointer not captured

  The snipping tool does not capture the mouse pointer.

  An alternative to capture the mouse pointer is to use → design/graphic/IrfanView: Menu Options -> Capture/Screenshot… (and selecting *Include mouse cursor*).

}

sa:

  The → Windows/keyboard-shortcuts[keyboard shortcut] `windows+shift+s` allows to take a freeform, rectangular or fullscreen clip an put in the → Windows/clipboard.
  -
  `windows` + `print screen` takes a full screenshot.

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Magnify_exe`

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/psr_exe` is the *problem steps recorder*.

 `→ development/tools/scripts/personal/wsl-screenshot-to-clipboard` is used in a → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux (WSL) environment to copy a screenshot made with `SnippingTool.exe` into the → Linux/X/clipboard[clipboard] using `→ Linux/X/clipboard/xclip`.
