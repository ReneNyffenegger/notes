*Execute a command on selected files*.

{ Delete files that are older than 5 days

  The following command recursively (`/s`) deletes files below `p:\ath\to\directory` that are older than 5 days.

  The `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/if[if] @isdir == FALSE` makes sure that 
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/del[`del`] is only applied to files but not to directories.

  The variable `@path` is expanded to the absolute path of the matching files. (`@file` would expand to the file name only).

code {
C:\> forfiles /s /p p:\ath\to\directory /d -5 /c "→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd] → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/options/c_k[/c] → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/if[if] @isdir == FALSE → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/del[del] @path"
code }


}
{ Print files with a modification that is younger than a given date

  The following command prints files whose modification date is after `12/01/2019`. `@fdate` and `@ftime` expand to the printed file's modification date and time.

code {
P:\ath\to\directory> forfiles /s /m *.txt /d +12/01/2019 /c "cmd /c if @isdir == FALSE echo @path [@fdate @ftime]"
code }

  In order to reverse the criteria, `/d -12/01/2019` should be used.
