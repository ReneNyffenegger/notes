{ Extracting (untarring) a file

  In order to extract the contents of a file, the options `-x` and `-f` need to be given. `-f` specifies the filename of the tar file. `-x` tells `tar.exe` to extract all files.

code {
C:\path\to\directory> tar -xf someFile.tgz
code }

}
{ Only extracting patterns

  In the extract command, the patterns of the files to be extracted can be specified:
code {
C:\path\to\directory> tar -xf someFile.tgz foo*.exe bar*.dll
code }

}
