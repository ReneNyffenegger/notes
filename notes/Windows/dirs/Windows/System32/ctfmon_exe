$ ctfmon.exe

*CTF Loader*

`ctfmon.exe` controls *alternative user input* and the *Office language bar*. It is used for
  • speech recognition
  • handwriting recognition
  • keyboard
  • translation
  • other input technologies

A running `ctfmon.exe` → Windows/development/process[process] indicates that *Text Services Framework* (TSF) is installed.

I was successful to → Windows/Appearance/Taskbar/Language-Bar#win-show-disappeared-language-bar[show a language bar] again after it has disappeared from the
→ Windows/Appearance/Taskbar.

{ TODO

  Is this executable related to
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/CTF[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\CTF`]?

}
