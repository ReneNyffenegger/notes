{ Executing a PowerShell script in a cmd.exe batch file #powershell-script-in-bat-file

  The following example tries to demonstrate how it is possible to execute a → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] «script» in a → Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch file`]:
  gh|about-PowerShell|/powershell.exe/commandexecute-script.ps1||

  A few notes:
    • End each line with a caret (`^`) which is the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/line-continuation[`cmd.exe` line continuation character in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`]
    • Explicitely terminate each → Windows/PowerShell/language/statement with a `;` because the caret does not pass a → development/line-break[new line]
    • Start and end the script with a doubled quotation mark (`""`)
