{ Impersonate NT Authority\System #Utilman-replace-cmd

  It's possible to impersonate → Windows/security/SID/S-1-5/18[`NT Authority\System`] with the following *hack*. As Administrator,
    • Take ownership of `Utilman.exe`
    • Replace `Utilman.exe` by a copy of → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`]
    • Restart the PC to get to login screen
    • Click on the accessibility icon
