$ netsh.exe

*Network Command Shell*

{ Show Wi-Fi passwords #netsh-show-wlan-pw

  In a command line prompt such as → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe], the stored → development/security/password[password] for a given WLAN profile can be revealed like so:

  Determine the available profiles:
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile
code }

  Then use one of the profile names to show the password. (Apparently, Administrator rights are needed to reveal the password.)
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile "Living Room" key=clear
code }

}
sa:
  → development/networking/WLAN[WLAN]
