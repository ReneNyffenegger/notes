$ netsh wlan

{ Show available networks

  The available networks can be displayed with
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh] wlan show networks
code }


}
{ Determining available WLAN profiles

  `netsh.exe` can be used to show the available WLAN profiles:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh] wlan show profile
code }

}

{ Connect to a given WLAN profile

code {
C:\> netsh wlan connect  PROFILE
C:\> netsh wlan connect "PROFILENAME WITH SPACES"
code }

  It's then also possible to disconnect from the connected profile with
code {
C:\> netsh wlan disconnect
code }

  See also the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file] → development/tools/scripts/personal/wlan_bat[`wlan.bat`].


}
{ Show Wi-Fi passwords #netsh-show-wlan-pw

   If a WiFi → development/security/password[password] was forgotten, the stored password for a given
   WLAN profile can be revealed in a command line prompt such as → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe].
   For example, if the profile name is *Living Room*:
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile "Living Room" key=clear
code }

  Because the output is a bit verbose, the line that reveals the password can be searched for by piping
  the output of `netsh` into → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[`findstr.exe`]:
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile "Living Room" key=clear | → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[findstr.exe] /c:"Key Content"
code }

   In a German installation of Windows, the text to search for is *Schlüsselinhalt*.

{ The Wireless AutoConfig Service (wlansvc) is not running

  Apparently, the *wlansvc* → Windows/services is required to discover networks. This service was not started in a → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox[VirtualBox] installation of Windows:
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show networks
The Wireless AutoConfig Service (wlansvc) is not running.
code }
