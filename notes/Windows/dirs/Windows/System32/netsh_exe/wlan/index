$ netsh wlan

{ Determining available WLAN profiles

  `netsh.exe` can be used to show the available WLAN profiles:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh] wlan show profile
code }

}

{ Connect to a given WLAN profile

code {
C:\> netsh wlan connect  PROFILE
C:\> netsh wlan connect "PROFILENAME WITH SPACES"
code }

  It's then also possible to disconnect from the connected profile with
code {
C:\> netsh wlan disconnect
code }

  See also the → Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file] → development/tools/scripts/personal/wlan_bat[`wlan.bat`].

code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile "Living Room" key=clear
