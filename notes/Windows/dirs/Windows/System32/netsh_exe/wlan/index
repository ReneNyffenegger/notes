$ netsh wlan

{ Show available networks

  The available networks can be displayed with
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh] wlan show networks
code }


}
{ Determining available WLAN profiles

  `netsh.exe` can be used to show the available WLAN profiles:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh] wlan show profile
code }

}

{ Connect to a given WLAN profile

code {
C:\> netsh wlan connect  PROFILE
C:\> netsh wlan connect "PROFILENAME WITH SPACES"
code }

  It's then also possible to disconnect from the connected profile with
code {
C:\> netsh wlan disconnect
code }

  See also the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file] → development/tools/scripts/personal/wlan_bat[`wlan.bat`].


}
{ Show Wi-Fi passwords #netsh-show-wlan-pw

  In a command line prompt such as → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe], the stored → development/security/password[password] for a given WLAN profile (for example named *Living Room* can be revealed like so:
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile "Living Room" key=clear
code }

  Because the output is a bit verbose, the line that reveals the password can be searched for by piping the output of `netsh` into → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[`findstr.exe`]:
code {
C:\> netsh wlan show profile "Living Room" key=clear | → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[findstr.exe] /c:"Key Content"
code }

}
