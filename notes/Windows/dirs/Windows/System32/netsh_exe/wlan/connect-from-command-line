$ Connecting to a WLAN from a Windows Command Line

Apparently, it not so simple to connect to a wireless network from the command line that was never not connected before.

This page tries to show a way how it is possible to still connect to a wifi network for the first time in `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe` or → Windows/PowerShell.


{ Determine the available networks

code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe/wlan[netsh wlan] show networks | → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[findstr] SSID
code }

}
{ new-wlan.bat #new-wlan-bat

 `new-wlan.bat` is a → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file] for → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe] that creates a *→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh] profile → development/XML* file.

  After creating the profile XML file, it uses `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh wlan] add profile` to create a profile for the given SSID and
  `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/netsh_exe[netsh wlan] connect` connect to the newly created profile.

  The batch file is invoked with an SSID and an optional password:
code {
C:\> new-wlan THE_SSID
C:\> new-wlan THE_SSID "My Secret Garden"
code }

  The batch file itself is:
  gh|scripts-and-utilities|/new-wlan.bat||

}
