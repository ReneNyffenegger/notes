$ mstsc.exe

`mstsc.exe` is the → Windows/Remote-Desktop-Services[Terminal Server] Client. It allows to establish → Windows/Remote-Desktop-Services#rds-rdc[remote desktop connections] from a console such as → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe] or
→ Windows/PowerShell.

When started without command line options, it opens a GUI Dialog:

code {
mstsc.exe [connection-file] [command-line-options]
code }

The `connection-file` specifies the name of an `.rdp` file for the connection.

   `/v:<server[:port]>` ☰ Specifies the remote PC to which you want to connect.
   `/g:<gateway>` ☰ Specifies the RD Gateway server to use for the connection. This parameter is only read if the endpoint remote PC is specified with /v.
   `/admin` ☰ Connects you to the session for administering a remote PC.
   `/f` ☰ Starts Remote Desktop in full-screen mode.
   `/w:<width>` ☰ Specifies the width of the Remote Desktop window.
   `/h:<height>` ☰ Specifies the height of the Remote Desktop window.
   `/public` ☰ Runs Remote Desktop in public mode.
   `/span` ☰ Matches the remote desktop width and height with the local virtual desktop, spanning across multiple monitors, if necessary. To span across monitors, the monitors must be arranged to form a rectangle.
   `/multimon` ☰ Configures the Remote Desktop Services session monitor layout to be identical to the current client-side configuration.
   `/edit` ☰ Opens the specified `.rdp` connection file for editing.
   `/restrictedAdmin` ☰ Connects you to the remote PC in Restricted Administration mode. In this mode, credentials won't be sent to the remote PC, which can protect you if you connect to a PC that has been compromised. However, connections made from the remote PC might not be authenticated by other PCs, which might impact application functionality and compatibility. This parameter implies `/admin`.
   `/remoteGuard` ☰ Connects your device to a remote device using Remote Guard. Remote Guard prevents credentials from being sent to the remote PC, which can help protect your credentials if you connect to a remote PC that has been compromised. Unlike Restricted Administration mode, Remote Guard also supports connections made from the remote PC by redirecting all requests back to your device.
   `/prompt` ☰ Prompts you for your credentials when you connect to the remote PC.
   `/shadow:<sessionID>` ☰ Specifies the ID of the session to shadow.
   `/control` ☰ Allows control of the session when shadowing.
   `/noConsentPrompt` ☰ Allows shadowing without user consent.

{ Specifying the server

  With `/v`, the name of a terminal server can be specified to which a connection should opened.

mstsc /v SRV

{ Windows Defender Credential Guard does not allow using saved credentials. #mstsc-store-credentials

  With Windows 11 (?), `mstsc.exe` does not seem to store credentials anymore and opens a dialog, stating that *Windows Defender Guard does not allow using saved credentials*.

  However, using the following command, credentials can still be stored:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmdkey_exe[cmdkey] /generic:TERMSRV/<hostname> /user:<domain>\<username> /pass:<password>
code }


}

 `mstsc.exe` is also used in → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux#wslg[WSLg].
