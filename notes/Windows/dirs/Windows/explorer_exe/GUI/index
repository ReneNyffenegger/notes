}
{ Folder Options (popup)

  Three tabs:
    • General
    • View
    • Search

  { General

    Open File Explorer to
      • Quick access, or
      • This PC

    Browse folders
      • Open each folder in the same window, or
      • Open each folder in its own window

    Click items as follows
      • Single-click to open an item (point to select) (sub-options: «Underline icon titles consistent with my browser» and «Underline icon titles only when I point at them»), or
      • Double-click to open an item (single click to select)

    Privacy (checkboxes):
      • Show recently used files in *Quick access*
      • Show frequencly used folders in *Quick access*

    The *Search* tab also has the button *Restore Defaults*.

  }

}
{ Quick access #explorer-GUI-quick-access

 *Quick access* is the equivalent of *Favorites* that was found older → Windows/versions[Windows Versions].

  A particular problem of *Quick access* is that shows only the name of a folder. Thus, two folders with the same name cannot be distinguished in
  Quick access.

  Quick access can be configured to be the location that the → Windows/dirs/Windows/explorer_exe[File Explorer] opens to when started:
  Folder Options (popop), tab General.
  -
  The Folder Options popup can be opened under View -> Options -> Change folder and search options.

  { Frequent folders / Recent files #explorer-GUI-frequent-folders-recent-files

    When Quick access is active, the right pane shows two «locations» (if they're not hidden).
      • Frequent folders
      • Recent files

    These two locations can be hidden:
      • In the *Folder Options popup* under the tab *General*, group *Privacy* by unticking «Show recently used files in Quick access» and «Show frequently used folders in Quick access».
      • In the → Windows/registry by setting the values of → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer#reg-hkcu-explorer-showRecent-Frequent[`ShowFrequent` and/or `ShowRecent`] under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer`] to `0`.

  }

}
{ Pin or unpin shell folders from the File explorer's left side

  In the → Windows/registry, it is possible to set the value of `System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree` under
  `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes[HKCU\Software\Classes]\CLSID\{clsid}` to `1` or `0` which
  determines if the corresponding *Shell folder* is pinned to the *navigation pane* (that is: if it is visible on the left side of the File explorer), see
  also → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/properties/props-system-ispinnedtonamespacetree[this Microsoft documentation link]:
  gh|about-Windows-Registry|/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/CLSID/namespace-tree-pinning.ps1||

}
{ This PC #explorer-GUI-This-PC

  The following PowerShell script removes a few items from the *This PC* pane by modifying values under the
  → Windows/registry key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/FolderDescriptions[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderDescriptions`].
  gh|about-Windows-Registry|/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/FolderDescriptions/show-hide-folders-in-This-PC.ps1||

  Some sources on the internet also claimed that it is possible to hide folders by setting a few values under the registry key
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/HideMyComputerIcons[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\HideMyComputerIcons`] -
  yet, I was unable to hide anything in my tests.
