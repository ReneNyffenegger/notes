$ %SystemRoot%\Installer

The *Windows Installer Directory*, typically located under `C:\Windows\Installer`.

This directory is needed when applications are installed or updated: it stores the necessary `.msi` (installer) and `.msp` (patch) files.

Usually, this directory occupies quite some space on the harddrive and it's tempting to remove files from it - however, its not really safe because some files are
needed to uninstall (or update?) applications.

If space becomes a concern, trying to *compress* the folder might be an option.

{ TODO

  `msizap.exe` (Windows SDK Components for Windows Installer Developers) is a command line utility that removes either all Windows installer information for a product
  or all products installed on a computer.
