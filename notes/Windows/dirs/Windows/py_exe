$ C:\Windows\py.exe

`C:\Windows\py.exe` is the → https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows[Python Launcher for Windows]. If Python is not installed «for all users», `py.exe` is found undeer
→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Launcher[`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Launcher`].

`py.exe` helps to execute Python scripts with different → development/languages/Python versions on a (Windows) system.

Because it is installed in → Windows/dirs/Windows[`C:\Windows`], it does not require the → Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[`PATH` environment variable] to be set to a specific Python executable.

In fact, the idea of `py.exe` is to locate the correct path when needed.

Run a script (or here: command) with the newest Python 2 version:
code {
C:\> py -2 -c "import sys; print (sys.version)"
2.7.17 (v2.7.17:c2f86d86e6, Oct 19 2019, 21:01:17) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]
code }

Run a script (or here: command) with the newest Python 3 version:
code {
C:\> py -3 -c "import sys; print (sys.version)"
3.8.0 (tags/v3.8.0:fa919fd, Oct 14 2019, 19:21:23) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)]
code }

  Printing the value of → development/languages/Python/standard-library/sys#python-sys-executable[`sys.executable`], it can be seen that `py.exe` really acts as a launcher to start another executable. It also helps to
  find out which executable this is:
code {
C:\> py -c "import sys; print (sys.executable)"
→ development/languages/Python/installation/directory/python[C:\Users\rene\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\python.exe]
code }

}
{ Other installation directories

  The launcher is installed under `C:\Windows` if Python is installed for all users. If Python is installed for one user only, the launcher goes
  under `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs[%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs]\Python`.
