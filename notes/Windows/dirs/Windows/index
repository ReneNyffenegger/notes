$ %SYSTEMROOT%

A typical value for `%SYSTEMROOT%` seems to be `C:\Windows`.

Apparently, `%SYSTEMROOT%` and `%WINDIR%` usually point to the same directory. Additionally, in Windows 10, the environment variable `%CSIDL_WINDOWS%` also points to `%SYSTEMROOT%`.

→ Windows/dirs/Windows/INF[%SYTEMROOT%\INF]

{ Opening folders below `%SYTEMROOT%`

  Folder below `%SYTEMROOT%` can be opend in → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe] with → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/start[`start`] (if `%SYSTEMROOT%` is in `%PATH%` which it usually is). The following example opens the
 `fonts` folder below `C:\windows`
code {
C:\> start fonts
code }

  Similarly, these folders can also be directly opened using `Win+R` and then typing the folder name.
