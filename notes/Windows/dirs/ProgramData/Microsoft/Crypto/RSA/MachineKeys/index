Apparently, containers created with → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-SDKs/Windows/version/bin/NETFX-version-Tools/sn_exe[`sn.exe`] are
created below this directory.

{ Failed to generate a strong name key pair -- Access is denied. #failed-to-generate-a-strong-name-key-pair

  The `sn.exe` error message *Failed to generate a strong name key pair -- Access is denied.* might be caused by a user with to little access rights on this folder.

  The required access rights can be granted as admin with (Rene being the username):
code {
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cacls_exe “%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys” /E /G Rene:F
code }
