{ Upgrading Chocolatey

  Of course, Chocalatey itself is upgraded/update with `choco`:
code {
choco upgrade chocolatey
code }

}
{ Installing as non-admin user

  The → https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation#non-administrative-install[Chocolatey non-administrative section of the docs] gives some hints as to installing a pacakge as non-admin → Windows/user-account[user].

  It seems to boil down to defining the → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variable] `ChocolateyInstall` with the value of the directory into which the package needs to be installed:
code {
$env:ChocolateyInstall="→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/home[$home]\bin\pkg"
code }

  See also → https://superuser.com/a/1096805/16610[this superuser answer]

}

sa:

  → Windows/Chocolatey

  `choco.exe` is found in the → Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin[`%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin`] directory.
