code {
PS> $ps_exe = (get-process -pid $pid).path
ps> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/start  $ps_exe -verb runAs
PS> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/get ctfmon | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/process/stop
PS> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ctfmon_exe
code }

}
