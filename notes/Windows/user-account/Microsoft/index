$ Microsoft Account

Microsoft Accounts were formerly referred to as *Windows Live ID*.

? When a user tries to sign into a website with support for Microsoft Account, the connection is first redirected to an → development/security/authentication server to prompt the user for a username and password.
If the user can be authenticated, a time-limited → development/web/HTTP/cookie[cookie] is sent back to the → development/web/browser[browser]. This cookie includes a triple DES encrypted ID tag which allows
to use services without entering the password again.
