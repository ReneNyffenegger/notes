$ Windows development


{ PE (Portable Executable) format #win-pe

  Windows binaries follow the *PE format* (while → Linux binaries follow the *ELF* format).

  Common suffixes of PE-files are `.exe`, `.dll` or `.sys`.

  See also: → Windows/development/Portable-Executable

}
{ Console application vs Windows application

  A windows executable is either a *console application* or a *Windows application* (apparently aka SFU or native application).

  In case of a console application, the `CreateProcess` → Windows/development/WinAPI function will create a console window and attach `STDIN`, `STDOUT` and `STDERR` streams to the console.
  -
  These streams will be closed for windows applications.

}
{ Threads

  Each → Windows/development/process/thread[thread] has its own *input queue*.
  -
  The *current thread's* window that receives input can be obtained with `GetActiveWindow` (Or ist it `GetFocus()`???). (Compare with `GetForegroundWindow` which reterns the window that currently is receiving input).

{ Misc / TODO

  { NtAPI - Syscalls

    Unlike in Unix, Windows applications don't call → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[sys calls]. Rather, they call the → Windows/development/WinAPI which in turn calls
    functions from the *native API* (NtAPI) which in turn do the sys calls.

    The NtAPI is implemented in *ntdll.dll* and is not documented.

    However, there *are* sys calls in Windows. The → https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/32/[Windows X86 System Call Table] (for NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/8/10) shows how instable the syscall numbers are accross
    Windows versions. (See also → https://github.com/hfiref0x/SyscallTables)

  { No MSVCRT

    → https://github.com/henkman/no-msvcrt: a few modules that require no msvcrt: console, args, bstr and regexp.

  { Subsystems

    There are two main *subsystems* to program for: CONSOLE and WINDOWS.
