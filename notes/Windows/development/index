{ PE (Portable Executable) format #win-pe

  Windows binaries follow the *PE format* (while â†’ Linux binaries follow the *ELF format).

{ Threads

  Each thread has its own *input queue*.
  -
  The *current thread's* window that receives input can be obtained with `GetActiveWindow` (Or ist it `GetFocus()`???). (Compare with `GetForegroundWindow` which reterns the window that currently is receiving input).
