$ Windows development


{ PE (Portable Executable) format #win-pe

  Windows binaries follow the *PE format* (while → Linux binaries follow the *ELF* format).

}
{ Threads

  Each thread has its own *input queue*.
  -
  The *current thread's* window that receives input can be obtained with `GetActiveWindow` (Or ist it `GetFocus()`???). (Compare with `GetForegroundWindow` which reterns the window that currently is receiving input).

{ Misc / TODO

  { NtAPI

    Unlike in Unix, Windows applications don't call → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[sys calls]. Rather, the call the → Windows/development/WinAPI which in turn calls
    functions from the *native API* (NtAPI) which in turn do the sys calls.

    The NtAPI is implemented in *ntdll.dll* and is not documented.
