$ Windows sessions
@ session

A session is a container for a user's → Windows/development/process[processes] and data identity.

The special session 0 is used for *system* → Windows/development/process[processes] and → Windows/services[services].
-
This session (or services?) cannot display a user interface directly but can call `WTSSendMessageA` to open a message box in another session.

A session runs its own win32k instances under `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/csrss_exe`.

The first → Windows/user-account[user] to log on is connected to session 1, the next to session 2 and so on.

On the command line (`→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe`, → Windows/PowerShell), a session can be terminated with
`→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/logoff_exe`.

{ Relation to terminals

? A terminal is the set of in/out devices attached to a computer, typically keyboard, mouse and monitor etc, including their configuration.


  A terminal is most of the time attached to a session, in fact, this is the terminal's purpose. (A terminal is not attached if it is being destroyed or in the process of being attached).
  
  { Common types of terminals

    The two common terminal types are
    table { ll
      Console terminals ☰ Connected to a *console host*. Only one active console terminal on a given machine - and, with a few exceptions, always active.
      Remote terminals ☰ The input and output is transferred from/to devices that are not present on the local systems. Remote terminals are created protocol providers that integrate with the Remote Desktop SErvices interface (RDP, Citrix, VMWare …)
    table }

    There are also other terminal types, but these are rare.

  }

}

{ TODO

  The *session id* in the key name → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Volatile-Environment/n[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment\n`] and the
  value of → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Volatile-Environment/n#reg-vol-env-sessionname[`SESSIONNAME`] within that key.

  Each session is associated with a → Windows/security/SID/S-1-5-5-x-y_logon[logon SID]
