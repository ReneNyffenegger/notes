$ Windows sessions
@ session

Most systems have multiple sessions.

Session 0 is used for system → Windows/development/process[processes] and → Windows/services[services]. This sessions (or services?) cannot display a user interface directly but can call
`WTSSendMessageA` to open a message box in another session.
-
The first → Windows/user-account[user] to log on is connected to session 1, the next user that logs on to session 2 and so on.

On the command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell), a session can be terminated with
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/logoff_exe[`logoff.exe`]).

{ TODO

  The *session id* in the key name → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Volatile-Environment/n[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment\n`] and the
  value of → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Volatile-Environment/n#reg-vol-env-sessionname[`SESSIONNAME`] within that key.

}
sa:

  Each session is associated with a → Windows/security/SID/S-1-5-5-x-y_logon[logon SID]

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/tscon_exe#tscon-switch-between-sessions

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/query_exe[query] session`
