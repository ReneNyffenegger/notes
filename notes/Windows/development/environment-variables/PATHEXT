$ Windows environment variable PATHEXT
@ PATHEXT

The → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variable] `%PATHEXT%` contains a list of → development/filename-extensions[file extensions] (with the corresponding dot) that are separated by a semicolon (as are the paths in `%PATH%`).

The extensions usually specify a file type that can somehow be executed. Commonly seen extenions include:
  • `.COM`
  • `.EXE`
  • `.BAT`
  • `.CMD`
  • `.VBS`
  • `.VBE`
  • `.JS`
  • `.JSE`
  • `.WSF`
  • `.WSH`
  • `.MSC`

`PATHEXT` is used to start a program, → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file] or script without explicitly specifying its suffix
in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] or its → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/start[`start`] command.

There seems to be no Unix equivalent: → http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280528.

{ PowerShell

  In → Windows/PowerShell, the extension of a (non-→ Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] such as a → development/languages/Perl or → development/languages/Python script) must be
  listed in `PATHEXT` in order for the script to be executed in the *current* console (rather than spawning a new console in which the script is executed).
