$ Windows: locale

{ WinAPI

  The → Windows/development/WinAPI[WinAPI] stores locale ids in the → Windows/development/WinAPI/data-types#winnt_LCID[`LCID`] «data type».

  A locale id can be created with the  → Windows/development/WinAPI/data-types#winnt_h_MAKELCID[`MAKELCID(…)`] macro.

  Each → Windows/development/process/thread[thread] is assigned a locale, initially the *system default locale*, which can be changed with `SetThreadLocale()`.

}
{ Input Locale #windows-input-locale

  The *Input Locale* (aka input language) is
  a per-→ Windows/development/process[process] setting that specifies the used input language (such as German)
  and an used input method (for example a keyboard).

  Input Locales can be added and removed through the *Keyboard and Language* tab in the *Region and Language* → Windows/control-panel[control panel].
