$ Windows: locale



{ WinAPI


  The → Windows/development/WinAPI[WinAPI] stores locale ids in the → Windows/development/WinAPI/data-types#winnt_LCID[`LCID`] «data type».

  A locale id can be created with the  → Windows/development/WinAPI/data-types#winnt_h_MAKELCID[`MAKELCID(…)`] macro.

  Each → Windows/development/process/thread[thread] is assigned a locale, initially the *systemdefault locale*, which can be changed with `SetThreadLocale()`.
