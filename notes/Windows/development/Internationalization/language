$ Windows: language


{ Language id


  A language is identified by a *language id*. The language id is a 16 bit value.

  The language id calculated as a combination of a *primary language id* and a *sublanguage id*:
code {
locale id = 1024 * sublanguage id  +  primary language id.
code }

  For example: the *primary language id* for *German* is 7. Windows supports 5 German speaking countries, hence the sublanguage ids range from 1 to 5. Thus, the respective language ids are:
    • 1031 = 1*1024 + 7 for *German (Germany)*
    • 2055 = 2*1024 + 7 for *German (Switzerand)*
    • 3079 = 3*1024 + 7 for *German (Austria)*
    • 4003 = 4*1024 + 7 for *German (Luxembourg)*
    • 5127 = 5*1024 + 7 for *German Liechtenstein)*

  The → Windows/development/WinAPI[WinAPI] header files provide the `MAKELANGID` macro to create a *language id*.

  The language id for *English (US)* is ~1033~ (= 1*1024 + 9) and the hexadecimal value of 1033 is ~409~ which is why these two numbers are seen quite often
  in the → Windows/registry[registry] and in the file system.
