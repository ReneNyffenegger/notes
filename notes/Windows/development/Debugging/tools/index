    SymProxy ☰  Create a single HTTP symbol server on your network that all your debuggers can point to. This has the benefit of pointing to multiple symbol servers (both internal and external) with a single symbol path, handling all authentication, and increasing performance via symbol caching. Symproxy.dll is in the SymProxy folder in the installation directory.
    SymChk ☰ Compare executable files to symbol files to verify that the correct symbols are available.
