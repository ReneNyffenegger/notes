$ Debugging tools for Windows: scripting

Using â†’ Windows/development/Debugging/tools[Windows Debugging Tools] can be automated with scripts. These scripts can be used alike with
WinDbg, KD and CDB *except* that `.remote_exit` cannot be used in WinDbg and tha a debugging client cannot exit from a script that is
executed in WinDbg.

{ Comments

  An asterisk (`*`) causes the text after it to be ignored.

  The double-dollar sign (`$$`) is a command that is specifically used as comment. Unlike `*`, the scope `$$` only goes to the next `;` (or end of line).

  If `*` or `$$` follow a command, they need to be separated with a semicolon:
code {
* foo bar baz
g  ;*  go on
g  ;$$ go on again;  dt
* more comment
code }

}
{ Simple example

  { prog.c

    gh|Windows-Debugging-Tools|/scripting/ex-01/prog.c||

  }
  { The script

    gh|Windows-Debugging-Tools|/scripting/ex-01/script||

    The script can now be run like so:
code {
cdb -cf .\script .\prog.exe
code }

  }
  { Compilation of program

    gh|Windows-Debugging-Tools|/scripting/ex-01/compile.ps1||

  }


}
