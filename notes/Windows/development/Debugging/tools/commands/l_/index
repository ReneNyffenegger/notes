$ l- | l+

`l+x` turns a *source line options* (identfied by `x`) on, `l-x` turns it off.

These options control if source code and source lines are displayed while stepping through the program.

The source line options only take effect if toggled with the → Windows/development/Debugging/tools/commands/dot/lines[`.lines`] command or when using the `-lines` command line option.

The options include:
table { ll
  `l` ☰ line numbers
  `o` ☰ hide messages (along with `s`)
  `s` ☰ line text and line numbers
  `t` ☰ source mode (as opposed to assembly mode)
  `*` ☰ turns on/off all options
table }

sa:
  In order to have source lines, the debugger must have a corresponding → Windows/development/Debugging/symbol-files[symbol file]
  which is produced for example with cl's option → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/Z/i[`/Zi`].
