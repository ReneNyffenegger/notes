`t` executes a single instruction or source line. Unlike the related `p` (step) comamnd, `t` also steps *into* a function.

In → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/Debuggers/arch/windbg_exe[`windbg.exe`], the `t` command can be executed without having to press enter with `F11`.

→ Windows/development/Debugging/tools/commands/dot/step_filter[`.step_filter`] allows to define a list of functions to step over.
