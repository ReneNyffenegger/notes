*step* an instruction or a source line.

Using the `r` option (`pr`), the command also displays the values of all registers and flags.

`p` does not *step into* a function. In order to *step into* a function, use the → Windows/development/Debugging/tools/commands/t[`t` (= trace)] command.

→ Windows/development/Debugging/tools/commands/dot/step_filter[`.step_filter`] allows to define a list of functions to step over.
