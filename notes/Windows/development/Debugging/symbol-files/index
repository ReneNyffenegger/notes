$ Symbol Files

The extension of symbol files is → development/filename-extensions#pdb[`.pdb`] (at least when produced by the Visual C++ → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[compiler] or linker).

{ Content of a PDB file

  A PDB file contains
    • Public symbols (functions, static and global variables)
    • The object files that were used to create the executable, and their respective section
    • Frame pointer optimization (FPO) information
    • Type information (variables, structs …)
    • Source file name and line number

}
{ Generating PDB files

  In order to generate PDB files, → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[`cl`] needs to be invoked with either the `/Zi` or `/ZI` → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options[option] and
  the linker with the `/DEBUG` option.

  The PDB is created in the same directory as the created executable.

}
{ _NT_SYMBOL_PATH

  The `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable] is used by all(?) debugging tools to find symbol servers and symbol files.

  The format is:
code {
srv*[local cache]*[private symbol server]*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
code }

   or less abstract
code {
srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
code }

  With this value, the symbols are downoaded to `c:\symbols`.
  

}
{ Windows Version

  Symbol files must match the → Windows/versions[Windows version] of the Windows installation where they're used.

}
{ Misc

  These PDB files have nothing to do with → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle's] plugable databases which are also abbreviated with PDB.
 
}
{ TODO

  Symbol files have fully qualified path references to the source files. If the source files are moved to different location, the `.srcpath` command of WinDbg needs to be used to specify the new location.

  The WinDbg command `.sympath` seems to specify the location for symbol files.

}

sa:
  The `/pdb` and `/pdbstripped` linker option. (Apparently, the `/DEBUG` flag is essential for the linke to produce a PDB file.
  -
  The `Fd` compiler option names the pdb file for object files.
