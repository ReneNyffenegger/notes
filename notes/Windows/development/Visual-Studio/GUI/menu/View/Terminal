$ Visual Studio menu: View -> Terminal

*View -> Terminal* opens the *integrated terminal*.

The keyboard shortcut *ctrl+`*

Unfortunately, trying to open the terminal crashes Visual Studio in my environment (Does â†’ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/troubleshoot-terminal-launch[this link offer help]?)
