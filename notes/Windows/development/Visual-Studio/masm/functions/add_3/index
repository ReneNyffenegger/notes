$ masm example: function

The following example tries to demonstrate how a function can be created with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/masm[masm] and
then be called from a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C] program.

This example needs to be compiled on a x86 (not a x64) environment.

{ add_3.asm

 `func.asm` defines a function, named `_add_3` that adds the first three parameters (arguments) and returns it via
  the `eax` → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[register].

}
{ main.c

 `main.c` just calls the function and prints its result.
