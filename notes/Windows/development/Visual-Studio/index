$ Microsoft Visual Studio

{ Environment variables

  Installing *Visual Studio Express 2010* created the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `VS100COMNTOOLS`. This variable can be used to locate `vsvars32.bat` which itself
  sets further environment variables: `%include%`, `%lib%` and `%libpath%`:
code {
C:\some\path> "%VS100COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat"
Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 x86 tools.
code }

   { TODO

     Apparently, there is also a `vcvarsall.bat` that can be called with the target environment:
code {
call "%VS120COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
code }

   }

}
{ TODO

  `msbuild.exe`

}
