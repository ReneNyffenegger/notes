  Up to → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/versions[Visual Studio version 2015] (?), Visual Studio was
  installed under → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-version[`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio <version>`].

  Beginning with Visual Studio 2017 (?), it is (by default) installed under
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/version/edition[`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<version>\<edition>`] for
  example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community`.

{ Environment variables

  In order to run build tools from the command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe]), some → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/environment-variables[Visual Studio specific environment variables] need
  to → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/environment-variables#vs-set-env-vars[be set].

   The value of the environment variables `CL` and `CL_` are automatically used as
   → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options[options] when → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[`cl`] is invoked. It might therefore be set to
   at least the value of `/nologo`.
