$ Microsoft Visual Studio

{ Command line tools

  Command line tools are installed in the Visual Studio installation direcory under `VC\bin`.
  
  In order to be able to run these tools, the `vcvarsall.bat` → Windows/cmd-exe/batch-files[batch file] must be executed which sets the required
  → development/environment-variable[environment variables] (`PATH`, `TMP`, `INCLUDE`, `LIB`, `LIBPATH`, …).

}

{ Environment variables

    The content of the environment variables `CL` and `CL_` are automatically used as
    → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options[options] when → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[`cl`] is invoked. It might therefore be set to
    at least the value of `/nologo`.

   { Visual Studio Express 2010

  Installing *Visual Studio Express 2010* created the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `VS100COMNTOOLS`. This variable can be used to locate `vsvars32.bat` which itself
  sets further environment variables: `%include%`, `%lib%` and `%libpath%`:
code {
C:\some\path> "%VS100COMNTOOLS%\vsvars32.bat"
Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 x86 tools.
code }

   
     { TODO

       The → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[`cl`] version of Visual Studio 2010 is `16` (!)

     }

   }
   { Visual 2017 Community Edition

     After installing *2017 Community Edition*, there was no `VS…COMNTOOLS` environment variable.
   
   ? However, a `%VS150COMNTOOLS%` seems to be set with `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"`.

     The required environment variables can apparently be installed with one of these → Windows/cmd-exe/batch-files[batch files]
table { ll

                        ☰ calls
  `vcvars32.bat`        ☰ `vcvarsall.bat x86 %*`
  `vcvars64.bat`        ☰ `vcvarsall.bat x64 %*`
  `vcvarsamd64_x86.bat` ☰ `vcvarsall.bat x64_x86 %*`
  `vcvarsx86_amd64.bat` ☰ `vcvarsall.bat x86_x64 %*`

table }
     These batch files as well as `vcvarsall.bat` are located under `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build"`.

    `vcvarsall.bat` needs to be called like soc
code {
vcvarsall.bat [arch] [platform_type] [winsdk_version] [-vcvars_ver=vc_version] [-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre_mode]
code }

     `arch` is one of (as shown above)
       • `x86`
       • `x64`
       • `x64_x86`
       • `x86_x64`

     `platform_type` can be set to `uwp` for *Universal Windows Platform* applications.

     The `winsdk_version` is
       • a full windows 10 SDK number (such as `10.0.10240.0` (10240 being the *build number*) see → Windows/versions)
       • `8.1` (for the Windows 8.1 SDK)

     The `-vcvars_ver` apparently specifies the VC tool set:
       • `14.0` for VC++ 2015
       • `14.1x` 
       • `14.1x.yyyy`
       •  etc

    `spectre_mode` is either
      • `none`
      • `spectre`


     { TODO

       VS 2017 is installed under
         `c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\20xx\name of edition`.
       -
       The scripts are found under
         `c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\20xx\name of edition\VC\Auxiliary\Build`

       The version number of VS 2017 is 15.0, the VC++ version of 2017 is 14.xx (!). Compare with the values of the `_MSC_VER` and `_MSC_FULL_VER` macros.

       There is also the directory `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\Common7\Tools\vsdevcmd\core"` which contains
         • `dotnet.bat`

     Apparently, there is also a `vcvarsall.bat` that can be called with the target environment:
code {
call "%VS120COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
