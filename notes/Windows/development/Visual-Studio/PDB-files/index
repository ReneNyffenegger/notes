{ Content of a PDB file

  A PDB file contains
    • Public symbols (functions, static and global variables)
    • The object files that were used to create the executable, and their respective section
    • Frame pointer optimization (FPO) information
    • Type information (variables, structs …)
    • Source file name and line number

{ Generating PDB files

  In order to generate PDB files, → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[`cl`] needs to be invoked with either the `/Zi` or `/ZI` → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options[option] and
  the linker with the `/DEBUG` option.

  The PDB is created in the same directory as the created executable.

}
{ _NT_SYMBOL_PATH

  The `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable] is used by all(?) debugging tools to find symbol servers and symbol files.

  The format is:
code {
srv*[local cache]*[private symbol server]*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
code }

   or less abstract
code {
srv*c:\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
code }

  With this value, the symbols are downoaded to `c:\symbols`.
  

}

sa:
  The `/pdbstripped` linker option

  The *debugging tools* `pdbcopy` and `symchck`.
