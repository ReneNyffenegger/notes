$ cl /P /E /EP (Preprocess only)

The → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[Visual Compiler] options `/P`, `/E`, `/PE` → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocesses] a source file only (without compling it into an object file).

This can be demonstrated with the following simple source file (which is neither valid → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C nor → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP[C++] code):
gh|about-cl|/options/E-P-EP/file.c||

{ /P to preprocess into a file

  `cl /P file.c` creates `file.i` with the following content:
code {
#line 1 "file.c"
Start

The number is 42

It is defined


#line 9 "file.c"
The end
code }

}
{ /E to preprocess to stdout

  `cl /E file.c` prints the (same) preprocessed result to → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdout].

}
{ /EP to omit the line directives

  `cl /EP file.c` also writes the preprocessed result to stdout and it also removes the `#line` directives:
code {

Start

The number is 42

It is defined



The end
code }

}
