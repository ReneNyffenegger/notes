$ cl /Fo

The `/Fo` option specifies the name of the object file to be created.

Note: there is no space or colon between the `/Fo` option and the name (which is confusing because the linker option → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/options/out[`/OUT`] requires a colon).

The following command compiles `unit.c` and creates the object file `bla.obj`.

code {
C:\> cl /c unit.c /Fobla.obj
code }

sa:
  → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/F[`cl /F…`]
