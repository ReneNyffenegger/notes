$ cl /Fo

The `/Fo` option specifies the name of the object file to be created.
-
This option is especially useful in combination with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/c[`/c`] option.

Note: there is no space or colon between the `/Fo` option and the name (which is confusing because the linker option → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/options/out[`/OUT`] requires a colon).

Note also, that `cl` has a `-o` option to name the object file. However, this option is deprecated (Warning message being *Command line warning D9035: option `o` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release*).

The following Makefile demonstrates the usage of `/Fo` and → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/F/e[`/Fe`] to create obj files and an exe file:

{ main.c

  gh|about-cl|/options/F/o/main.c||

}
{ func.c

  gh|about-cl|/options/F/o/func.c||

}
{ func.h

  gh|about-cl|/options/F/o/func.h||

}
{ Makefile

  gh|about-cl|/options/F/o/Makefile||

}

sa:
  → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/F[`cl /F…`]
