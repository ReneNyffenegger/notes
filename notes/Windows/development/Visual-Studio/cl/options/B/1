$ cl /B1

The `/B1` option names an alternative → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl#cl-frontend-backend[frontend]
compiler (which is responsible for the parsing of the source code and ordinarily is `c1` (c-one, not c-ell) for → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[cl].

With such an alternative frontend, it *might* be possible to find the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/_default[default options] for `cl`.

{ cl-frontend.c

  This simple source build an alternative frontend. It checks for the two → development/environment-variable[environment variables] `MSC_CMD_FLAGS` and `MSC_IDE_FLAGS` and
  prints their values if they exist.

  Since it does not do anything meaningful else, it just returns -1.

}
{ prog.c

  This is the program we try to build with the alternative frontend.
