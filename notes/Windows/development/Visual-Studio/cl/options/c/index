$ cl /c

`cl /c prog.c` compiles a source file (`prog.c`) and creates an object file from it, but no linking will be done to create an executable or a DLL.
-
By default, the created object file has the name as the source file, but with the → development/filename-extensions[suffix] `.obj`. In order to specify a non-default name for the object
file to be created, the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/F/o[`/Fo`] option needs to be used.

sa:
  Other → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options[cl options].
