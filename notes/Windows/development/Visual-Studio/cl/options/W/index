$ cl /W …

The `/Wn` option specifies the level of warnings to be generated. `n` is a number from `0` to `4` or `all` with the following meaning:
  • `/W0`: all warnings are disabled (apparently the same as the small cap `/w`)
  • `/W1`: *severe* warnings. This is the default
  • `/W2`: Additionally warn about *siginificant* findings
  • `/W3`: Warn about *production quality* impacts
  • `/W4`: Show *informational warnings* too
  • `/Wall`: Also include warnings that are not turned off by default

  In order to temporarily suppress (an expected) warning, one might use
