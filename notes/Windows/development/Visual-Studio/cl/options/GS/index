$ cl /GS

Sources that are compiled with `/GS` (which is enabled by default) protect stack variables from overflows that result in arbitrary code execution, thus
mitigating buffer overfow vulnerabilities in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C] and → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP[C++].
 
The goal of using `/GS` is to detect corruption of a functions's return address that is stored on the stack. This is achieved by placing a cookie right after (before?)
the *frame pointer* and before (after?) the *exception handler frame*.
