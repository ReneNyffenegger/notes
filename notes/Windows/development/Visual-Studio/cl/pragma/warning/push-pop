$ cl: pragma warning push/pop

`#pragma warning(push)` followed by a `#pragma warning(disable: …)` can be used to prevent the compiler from issuing a warning until the suspension is nullified again with
`#pragma warning(pop)`.

For example, if a c program is compiled with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/W[`/W4`], it would warn with *warning C4100* if a function parameter is not referenced. In the
following example, this warning is inhibited with the necessary `#pragma`.

gh|about-cl|/pragma/warning/push-pop/disable/prog.c||

The program can be compiled with this Makefile:
gh|about-cl|/pragma/warning/push-pop/disable/Makefile||

sa:
  → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[cl]
