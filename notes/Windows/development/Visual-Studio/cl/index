`cl` invokes the linker after compiling the source files *except* when one of the following → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options[options] is specified:
  `/c`, `/E`, `/EP`, `/P`, `/Zg` and `/Zs`. (`/Zg` was removed in → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio 2015]).

{ Frontend and Backend #cl-frontend-backend

  `cl` drives a frontend which is implemented in `c1.dll` (c-one, not c-ell) for → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C] and `c1xx.dll` for
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP[C++].

  The backend (optimizer?) is implemented in `c2.dll`.

  The frontend and backend can be controlled with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/dn[`/d1` and `/d2`] options.

  The actual times spent in the frontend and backend are reported with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/B/t[`/Bt`] option.

  A different frontend can be specified with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/B/1[`/B1`] option.
