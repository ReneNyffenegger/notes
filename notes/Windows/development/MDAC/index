$ Microsoft Data Access Components
@ MDAC

MDAC consists of three primary technologies:
  • → development/databases/ADO[ADO]
  • → development/databases/OLE-DB
  • → development/databases/ODBC

ADO is a high level interface to the lower level OLE-DB interface. Both, ADO and OLE-DB, can work with relational → development/databases[databases] and hierarchical or stream → development/Data[data].

ODBC is also a low level interface that only works with relational databases.
