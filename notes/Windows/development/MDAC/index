$ Microsoft Data Access Components
@ MDAC

MDAC consists of three primary technologies:
  • → development/databases/ADO[ADO]
  • → development/databases/OLE-DB
  • → development/databases/ODBC

ADO is a high level interface to the lower level OLE-DB interface. Both, ADO and OLE-DB, can work with relational → development/databases[databases] and hierarchical or stream → development/Data[data].

ODBC is also a low level interface that only works with relational databases.

{ Windows Data Access Components (WDAC) #WDAC

  With → Windows/versions[Windows Vista] and Windows Server 2008, Microsoft changed the name from MDAC to WDAC (= Windows Data Access Components).

  WDAC is included as part of the operating system.

  Note that WDAC is also the abbreviation for *→ Windows/security/defender[Windows Defender] Application Control*.

  MDAC/WDAC consists of the following components:
    • ODBC

    • ADOMD (ADO Multi-Dimensional, also known as Microsoft Analysis Services Provider). No major feature enhancements have been made to it since MDAC 2.0.
    • → development/databases/ADO/ADOX
    • Microsoft SQL Server Network Libraries
    • MSDASQL, the → development/databases/ODBC[OLE DB Provider for ODBC]


  { Microsoft SQL Server Network Libraries

    SQL Server Network Libraries allow SQLOLEDB and SQLODBC to communicate with the SQL Server database.

    Deprecated Microsoft SQL Server Network Libraries:
      • Banyan Vines
      • AppleTalk
      • ServerNet
      • IPX/SPX
      • Giganet
      • RPC

    TCP/IP and Named Pipes will continue to be supported and are available on the 64-bit Windows operating system.
      
  }
  { MSDASQL

    MSDASQL ships with the Windows operating system, and Windows Server 2008 and Vista SP1 were the first Windows releases to include a 64-bit version of the technology.
