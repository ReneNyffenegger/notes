$ Windows thread

A thread is a part of a → Windows/development/process[process] that Windows can schedule for execution on a CPU.

A thread is identified by a *thread id*.

Components of threads:
  • CPU state
  • Two stacks, one for kernel mode and one for user mode
  • Thread local storage (TLS)
  • run time libraries / DLLs
  • Access token

Important structures are
  • ETHREAD (kernel mode)
  • → Windows/development/process/thread/TIB[TEB, aka TIB] (user mode)
  


{ locale

  Each thread is assigned a *locale* which initially is the *system default locale* (`LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT`, whose value ix 0x0800 ).

  A thread's locale can be changed with the → Windows/development/WinAPI[WinAPI] function `SetThreadLocale`.
