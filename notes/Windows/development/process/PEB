$ PEB - Windows Process Environment Block

PEB is the Windows → Windows/development/process[Process] Environment block

Offset `0x30` of the → Windows/development/process/thread/TIB[TIB] (on Win32?) points to the PEB.
-
The PEB can be programatically found with `NtCurrentTeb() -> ProcessEnvironmentBlock`



`PEB.BeingDebugged` indicates if a → Windows/development/WinAPI/Debugging[debugger] is attached.

It seems like the `ebx` → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[register] (x64: rbx)  register points to the PEB when an
→ Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[exe's] → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE/entry-point[entry point] is called.
