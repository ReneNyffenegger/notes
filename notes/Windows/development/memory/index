$ Windows - memory

{ Virtual memory #win-virtual-memory

  The *virtual memory* is a contiguous space of memory (-addresses) that each â†’ Windows/development/process[process] sees. Usually, this space is larger than the available physical memory.

  The order of addresses in virtual memory does not correspond to the order of addresses in the physical memory.

  By default, the lower half of the virtual memory can be used for the data of a process while the upper half is used for Windows. (Only in 32-bit Windows?)

{ Memory manager

  The *memory manager* maps a process's virtual memory onto the physical  memory.

  Because the available physical memory at times cannot cover all required access to virtual memory, the memory manager paging out and in parts of the virtual memory to disk.
