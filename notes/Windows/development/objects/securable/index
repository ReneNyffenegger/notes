$ Windows: securable objects
@ securable object

{ Permissions

  The owner of a securable object can assign *permissions* to the object. These permissions control which operations can be executed by whom. 

  These permissions are stored in *access control entries (ACEs)*.

  Sometimes, these ACEs are also referred to as *discretionary ACEs* because the assignment of permissions is at the owner's discretion.

  Permissions must not be confused with *user rights* (possibly also referred to as → Windows/security/privileges[privileges]) which are given to → Windows/user-account[users].
