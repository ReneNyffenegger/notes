$ Windows: Securable objects
@ securable object

An object is said to be *securable* if it can have a → Windows/security/descriptor.
-
All named Windows objects are securable.

{ Types of securable objects

  Examples of securable objects include
    • Files, Directories
    • → Windows/services[Services]
    • → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[Registry keys]
    • Processes, Threads (these are *unnamed* objects)
    • Access tokens
    • Named pipes
    • File mapping objects
    • DCOM applications
    • Semaphores
    • Events
    • Mutexes
    • Waitable timers
    • → Windows/Management-Instrumentation[WMI] namespaces
    • Active Directory Objects
    • Window stations
    • Desktop
    • Mailslots
    • Network shares
    • Printers
    • Private objects
}
{ Components of a securable object

  A securable object defines the following elements
    • The owner of the object, identified by its → Windows/security/SID
    • The group assocaited with the object, also identified by a SID. (This component is irrelevant for Windows components; it only exists for POSIX compatibility reasons).
    • The *Discretionary* Access Control List* (DACL)
    • The *System Access Control List* (SACL)

  The DACL determines users' and groups' permissions on the securable object.
  -
  DACL are called *discretionary* because they are asssigned at the assigner's discretion.

  Such permissions must not be confused with *user rights* (possibly also referred to as → Windows/security/privileges[privileges]) which are granted to → Windows/user-account[users] rather than objects.

{ Access Control List and Access Control Entries #win-acl-ace

  An *Access Control List* (ACL) is a *ordered list* of *Access Control Entries* (ACE).

  An Access Control Entry consists of
    • The user's or group's SID to which the ACE pertains
    • A particular access right
    • A flag, if this access right is allowed or denied.

  When an ACL is checked to determine if a user or group is allowed to perform a certain action on the securable object, the ACEs in the ACLs are evaluated in the order of their position.
  -
  As soon as such a check finds an explicit grant or denial of the requested access, the check stops. Therfore, the order of the ACEs in the ACL is important.
  -
  It is generally recommended to place deny-ACEs before allow-ACEs.
