$ Some Windows CRT sources

 `crtdefs.h`: definitions and declarations that are common to all CRTs.

→ Windows/development/CRT/source/crt0_c[`crt0.c`] (and its wide character version → Windows/development/CRT/source/wcrt0_c[`wcrt0.c`]):
 initializes the C Run-Time library and then calls either → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/main[`main()`], → Windows/development/CRT/wmain[`wmain()`], `WinMain()` or `wWinMain()`.

→ Windows/development/CRT/source/crt0dat_c[`crt0dat.c`] implements c run-time *initialization* and *termination* functions.

`crt0init.c` contains the *initialization segment declarations* (`.CRT$XIA` etc.)

`dllmain.c` provides a default («dummy») `DllMain`.

`excpt.h` defines exception values, types and routines, `excpt.inc` contains definitions for exception handling.

→ Windows/development/CRT/source/gs_support_c[`gs_support.c`] defines the `__security_init_cookie()` function which is called at startup to initialize
the *global buffer overrun security cookie* if compiled with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/GS[`/GS`].

→ Windows/development/CRT/source/stdargv_c[`stdargv.c`] processes the command line and creates the `argv[]` array for the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/main[`main()`] function.

→ Windows/development/CRT/source/tchar_h[`tchar.h`] contains definitions for generic international text functions.

→ Windows/development/CRT/source/wincrt0_c[`wincrt0.c`] and → Windows/development/CRT/source/wwincrt0_c[`wwincrt0.c`]
