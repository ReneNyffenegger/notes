$ Windows CRT: crt0.c

Initializes the C Run-Time library and then calls either → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/main[`main()`], → Windows/development/CRT/wmain[`wmain()`], `WinMain()` or `wWinMain()`.

`crt0.c` is included by → Windows/development/CRT/source/wcrt0_c[`wcrt0.c`],
→ Windows/development/CRT/source/wincrt0_c[`wincrt0.c`] and
→ Windows/development/CRT/source/wwincrt0_c[`wwincrt0.c`].


{ TODO

 `__tmainCRTStartup()` is defined in `crt0.c`.

  In newer versions of → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio], the role of this file seems to be in
  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/version/edition/VC/Tools/MSVC/version/crt/src/vcruntime/mcrtexe_cpp[`vcruntime/mcrtexe.cpp`].
