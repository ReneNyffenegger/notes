$ Windows CRT: dllcrt0.c

{ _DllMainCRTStartup

  `dlcrt0.c` contains `_DllMainCRTStartup` which is the default → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/options/entry[entry point] for
  → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs].
  
  `_DllMainCRTStartup`  calls `DllMain` via `__DllMainCRTStartup` (of which a dummy version is provided in → Windows/development/CRT/source/dllmain_c[`dllmain.c`].

  `_DllMainCRTStartup returns an `int` (long?) that is interpreted as a boolean) and is declared as → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/calling-convention#stdcall[stdcall] which is hidden behind the
  → Windows/development/WinAPI/data-types#wintdef_h_WINAPI[`WINAPI`] macro) :
code {
BOOL WINAPI _DllMainCRTStartup(
        HANDLE  hDllHandle,
        DWORD   dwReason,
        LPVOID  lpreserved
        ) {
        …
}
code }

  In newer versions of
