The → Windows/development/CRT/source[source code] for the CRT is included with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio] (under the directory
→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/version/edition/VC/Tools/MSVC/version/crt/src[`%VSxxxCOMNTOOLS%\MSVC\%VCToolsVersion%\crt\src`]).

  `ucrtbase.dll` seems to be the *universal CRT library* that came with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio[Visual Studio] 2015 and later.

  Visual Studio 2013 apparently had version-specfiic CRT libraries with different data structures, heap managers, memory allocators etc. and naming conventions etc. Thus, if
  a CRT (especially: memory) structure was passed from a source code unit that was built with one specific CRT version to a source code unit that was built with another,
  the application was likely to crash.
