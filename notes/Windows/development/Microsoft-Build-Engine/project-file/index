$ MS Build project file

→ Windows/development/Microsoft-Build-Engine[MS Build] uses *project files* to describe building instructions.
-
Additionally, it also allows to describe build-rules that then can be reused on various targets.

These project files are → development/XML files and similar in nature to *Apache Ant* or *Nant*.

The MS Build project file format is used by → Windows/development/Visual-Studio to store information about projects it manages.

{ Most simple project file

  A project file (with suffix `.csproj`) needs at least a `<Project>` and a `<Target>` tag and a `Name` attribute.
  -
  Thus the (possibly) *most simple* project file becomes
  gh|about-MSBuild|/project-files/most-simple/file.csproj||

}
{ Properties / <PropertyGroup>

  The `<PropertyGroup>` tag contains *properties*. A property is simply a key/value pair. The tag-names within `<PropertyGroup>` correspond to the proporty names, their data to the property values.

  The following `<PropertyGroup>` defines a property named *BuildDir* whose value is *bin*:
code {
<PropertyGroup>
    <BuildDir>bin</BuildDir>
</PropertyGroup>
code }

  { Conditional property values

    It's possible to put a condition on a property. The property only is assigned the respective value if the condition is true.

    In the following example, the value of *BuildDir* is set to *Debug\bin* if the value of the property *Configuration* is equal to *Debug*:
code {
<PropertyGroup>
    <BuildDir Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug' ">debug\bin</BuildDir>
</PropertyGroup>
code }

  }

}
{ Item types / Items / <ItemGroup>

  An `<ItemGroup>` names items (that typically represent files to be compiled etc.). The tag names within the `<ItemGroup>` need to be the same (although case-independent). This tag name
  specifies the name of the *item type*. The value of the item type is referred to with `@(itemtypename)`.

  In the following example, the value of `@(Compile)` is `foo.cs;bar.cs;baz.cs`:
code {
<ItemGroup>
   <Compile Include="foo.cs" />
   <Compile Include="bar.cs" />
   <Compile Include="baz.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
code }

}
{ Tasks and Targes

  Tasks to be executed appear as child-tags in a `<Target>` tag:
code {
<Target Name="…">
  <Csc Sources="@(src)" />
  <AnotherTaskName …    />
</Target>
code }

  Typically, a task implements the `ITask` interface.
