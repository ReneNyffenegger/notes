$ MS Build project file: properties

In an → Windows/development/Microsoft-Build-Engine/project-file[MS Build project file], properties can be defiened or referenced in various ways:
  • → Windows/development/Microsoft-Build-Engine/project-file#msbuild-reserved_well-known-property[`<PropertyGroup>`] tag
  • reserved properties
  • → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variables]
  • the → Windows/development/Microsoft-Build-Engine/command-line-options/property[`-property`] command line option

The following simple project file tries to demonstrate these possibilities:
gh|about-MSBuild|/project-files/properties/various-ways.csproj||

In order to test the `-property` command line option, the file might be invoked like so:
code {
P:\ath\to\project\file:> msbuild -property:Property-two=foo various-ways.csproj
code }
