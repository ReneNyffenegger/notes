$ Programming the MSHTML Web Browser Control with C++

*2018-12-06: moved from http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/win/misc/mshtml/*

It is possible to render development/web/HTML[HTML] in an ordinary Windows program with *MSHTML*.

This makes it possible to have a web look and feel in a program. Because I thought
this is quite interesting, I decided to write some → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP[C++] classes that make it
possible to use MSHTML in an easy way. I found some ideas on how to do that on a now defunct link on codeproject.com (the title
of the link was: *Embed an HTML Control in your own window using plain C.*).

{ Displaying an URL

  The following program takes one argument which is an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC[URL] to be displayed:

  gh|cpp-MSHTML|/DisplayHTML.cpp||

  The executable can be called from → Windows/cmd-exe like so:
code {
C:\> DisplayHTML.exe www.your-favorite-url.zzz
code }

  gh|cpp-MSHTML|/img/DisplayHTML.png||

}
{ Rendering HTML

  Instead of an URL, it's also possible to render HTML (as text) with the following simple program:
  gh|cpp-MSHTML|/MSHTMLTest.cpp||

  When executed, it will open a Window like so:
  gh|cpp-MSHTML|/img/MSHTMLTest.png||

{ github repository

  The source code is hosted on → development/version-control-systems/git/github[github] at
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-MSHTML[github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-MSHTML].
  
  I was able to compile with → Windows/development/MinGW.

{ TODO: EventReceiverTest.cpp

  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-MSHTML/blob/master/EventReceiverTest.cpp[EventReceiverTest.cpp] is supposed to handle events (such as mouse clicks) in a MSHTML application.

  However, I didn't find this file anymore somewhere in one of my backups but I was able to recover a version from
  → https://web.archive.org/web/20041013070613/http://www.adp-gmbh.ch:80/win/misc/mshtml/event_receiver/index.html[archive.org].

  EventReceiverTest.cpp also needs `HTMLWindow.cpp` etc. However, the version of `HTMLWindow.cpp` that I found on
  → https://web.archive.org/web/20041012063806/http://www.adp-gmbh.ch:80/win/misc/mshtml/HTMLWindow.html[archive.org] was different from the one in my local source code repository.
  -
  Therefore, I stored the archive.org version under
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-MSHTML/blob/master/HTMLWindow2.cpp[HTMLWindow2.cpp] and
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-MSHTML/blob/master/HTMLWindow2.h[HTMLWindow2.h], respectively.

  Also, when compiling EventReceiverTest.cpp along with HTMLWindow2, the produced executable does not work properly.
