$ COM Apartments

There are three COM Apartment models:
table { llll
  Single-threaded apartments ☰ STA ☰ COM serializes calls between apartments through a Windows message loop. ☰ `→ Windows/development/COM/API/CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED)`
  Multi-threaded apartments ☰ MTA ☰ Serialization is not provided by COM, instead COM-components are expected to provide their own synchronization. ☰ `→ Windows/development/COM/API/CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED)`
  Neutral-threaded apartments ☰ NTA ☰ Windows 2000 only ☰
table }

A → Windows/development/process may have multiple STAs but only one MTA.

Every → Windows/development/COM/object belongs to exactly one apartment.
