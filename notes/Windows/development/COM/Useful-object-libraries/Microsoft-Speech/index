code {
$sapi = → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new/COM[-comObject] sapi.spVoice
→ Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/null = $sapi.speak('Hello world')
code }

  It is also possible to say something with → development/languages/VBScript:
code {
option explicit

dim sapi
set sapi = createObject("sapi.spVoice")
sapi.speak("Hello world.")
code }

}
