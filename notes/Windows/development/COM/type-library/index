$ COM: Type library
@ type library

A *type library* is a machine readable container that stores information about a → Windows/development/COM/object such as method and parameter names.
-
For example, the content of a type library can be viewed in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Browser[VBA Object Browser].

A type library file is typically identified by a → development/filename-extensions#tlb[`.tlb`], → development/filename-extensions#olb[`.olb`], `.ocx` and even `.exe` and `.dll` → development/filename-extensions[extensions].

Type libraries can be created with the MIDL compiler (→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/bin/version/midl_exe[`midl.exe`]).

The file sytem locations and other information about type libraries is stored in the → Windows/registry under the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/TypeLib[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib`].

In a → development/languages/VBA[VBA] project, a type library that is added to the project, is identified by a → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference[`Reference` object].
-
A new reference to a type library can be added with → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference#VBIDE-add-reference[`….references.addFromGUID(…)`].

{ TODO

  Finish → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/temp-cpp-type-lib[these C++ source code files to read a type library].

  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/bin/version/oleview_exe[`oleview.exe`] is a type library viewer.
