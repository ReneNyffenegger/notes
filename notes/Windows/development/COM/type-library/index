$ COM: Type library
@ type library

A *type library* is a machine readable container that describes → Windows/development/COM/object[COM objects]. Information stored in a type library includes, for exmample, method and parameter names.

The content of a type library can be viewed in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Browser[VBA Object Browser].

A type library file is typically identified by a → development/filename-extensions#tlb[`.tlb`], → development/filename-extensions#olb[`.olb`] or `.ocx` → development/filename-extensions[file extensions], but its data is
occasionally also found in → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[EXEs], → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DDLs] and even binary files.

{ Creating type libraries

  Type libraries can be created with the MIDL compiler (→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/bin/version/midl_exe[`midl.exe`]). The MIDL compiler obsoletes the
  → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/mktyplib-command-line-tool[MkTypLib command line tool].

  Thus, a type library is basically a binary version of a (humanly readable) MIDL file.

}
{ Registry

  Type libraries can be registered in the → Windows/registry under the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/TypeLib[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib`].
  -
  Thus, it is possible to find the file locations of type libraries on a system.

}
{ Using type libraries in VBA Projects

  In a → development/languages/VBA[VBA] project, a type library that is added to the project, is identified by a → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference[`Reference` object].

  A new reference to a type library can be added with → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference#VBIDE-add-reference[`….references.addFromGUID(…)`].

}
{ Reading type libraries

  The content of type libraries can be read with the `ITypeLib` interface.

  An instance of such an interface can be optained using the WinAPI function `LoadTypeLib`

}

  The function `addReference()` in the → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator tool.

  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/bin/version/oleview_exe[`oleview.exe`] is a type library viewer.

  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-SDKs/Windows/version/bin/NETFX-version-Tools/TlbImp_exe[`TlbImp.exe`] is the *Type Library Importer* and allows to create
  → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly[.NET assembly] from a type library.
