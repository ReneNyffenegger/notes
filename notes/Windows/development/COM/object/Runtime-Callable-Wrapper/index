$ COM Objects: Runtime Callable Wrappers

A *Runtime Callable Wrapper* (RCW) is used by the →  Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime to give the impression, that a
→ Windows/development/COM/object[COM Object] is an ordinary → Microsoft/dot-net object and thus hides the differences
between → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code[managed] and → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code/un.

Interfaces that are used (if exposed?) by RCW when wrapping a COM Object are:
  • → Windows/development/COM/IUnknown[`IUnknown`]
  • → Windows/development/COM/IUnknown/IDispatch[`IDispatch`]
  • `IErrorInfo`
  • `IProvideClassInfo`
  • `IConnectionPoint` and `IConnectionPointContainer` (optionally) 
  • `IDispatchEx` (optionally)
  • `IEnumVARIANT`
