Every → Windows/development/COM/object[COM object] needs an `IUnknown` interface. It serves two purposes:
  • *Reference counting* of objects
  • Dynamic discovery of *interfaces*.

{ QueryInterface #iunknown-queryInterface

  TODO: It can be assumed that → development/languages/VBA[VBA] implements → development/languages/VBA/functions/typeOf-is[`typeOf(var) … is …`] using `QueryInterface()`.

}
{ AddRef #iunknown-addref

  Increses the reference counter of the object.

}
