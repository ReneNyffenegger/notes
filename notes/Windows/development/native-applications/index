$ Windows: Native applications

The *entry point* for a native application is `NtProcessStartup` (rather than → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/main[`main`] or `WinMain`).

Most of the needed *runtime environment* for a native application is provided in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ntdll_dll.

Native applications (also) have an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[.exe] suffix.

An example of a native application is → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/autochk_exe.
