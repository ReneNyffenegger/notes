*WinAPI* is the OS-interface for applications running on Windows.

The functions from WinAPI are implemented in *kernel32.dll*, *advapi32.dll*, *gdi32.dll* and others.
-
Base services for accessing the file system, managing processes and handling devices are implemented in *kernel32.dll*.
-
Apparently, with Windows 7, these system libraries were refactored into *kernelbase32.dll*.

The default calling convention for the Win32 API is → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/calling-convention#stdcall[stdcall].

{ WOW64
 
 *WOW64* allows to run 32 bit processes on 64-bit Windows.

 `\Windows\SysWOW64`.
