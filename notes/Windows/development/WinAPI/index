*WinAPI* is the OS-interface for applications running on Windows.

The default calling convention for the Win32 API is → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/calling-convention#stdcall[stdcall].

{ Dlls

  The documenten WinAPI functions are implemented in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/kernel32_dll[kernel32.dll],
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/advapi32_dll[advapi32.dll], → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/gdi32_dll[gdi32.dll] and possibly others.
  -
  These → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs] forward calls to WinAPI functions to the appropriate and undocumented (for user mode)
  system service calls in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/ntoskrnl_exe[`ntoskrnl.exe`] and
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/win32k_sys[`win32k.sys`].

  Base services for accessing the file system, managing processes and handling devices are implemented in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/kernel32_dll[`kernel32.dll`].
  -
  Apparently, with Windows 7, these system libraries were refactored into → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/KernelBase_dll[`Kernelbase32.dll`].

{ WOW64
 
 *WOW64* allows to run 32 bit processes on 64-bit Windows.

 `\Windows\SysWOW64`.

}
{ Native System Services / Kernel support functions 

  WinAPI functions must be distinguished from *native system services* and *kernel support functions*: Only WinAPI functions are documented.
  
 *Native system services* are functions that are callable from *user mode*. For example, an application might call the WinAPI `CreateProcess()` function which in turn
  calls the native system service function `NtCreateService()`.

  A *Kernel support function* can only be called from within *kernel mode*, very possibly by *device drivers*
  -
  An example is `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` to allocate memory.


}
{ TODO

  *Windows Runtime* is an alternative API within the Win32 subsystem.
