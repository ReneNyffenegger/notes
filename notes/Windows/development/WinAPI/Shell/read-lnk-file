$ Windows API: read .lnk file with C++

The following → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus example tries to demonstrate how the
→ Windows/development/COM interfaces `→ Windows/development/COM/interfaces/IShellLink` and `→ Windows/development/COM/interfaces/IShellLinkDataList` can be used to read the content of a
→ development/filename-extensions#lnk[`.lnk`] file.

gh|Windows-development|/Shell/read-.lnk-file.cpp||

{ TODO

  In → Windows/PowerShell, it is possible to extract the target path (and some other properties) from a `.lnk` file using the `wShell` object
code {
$sh  = new-object -comObject wScript.shell
$lnk = $sh.createShortcut( $_.fullName )
$lnk.targetPath
code }

}
