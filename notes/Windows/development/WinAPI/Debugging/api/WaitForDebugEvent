A debugger uses `WaitForDebugEvent()` to wait for a *debugging event* in the target process.

After calling `WaitForDebugEvent()`, the debugger stops executing until such a debugging event occurs in the target process. When it has occured, all
→ Windows/development/process/thread[threads]
in the target process are stopped and execution resumes in the debugger.

The chapter → https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2201303[How Debuggers Work] (Inside Windows Debugging) lays out pseudo code
that roughly explains how `WaitForDebugEvent()` is used:
code {
CreateProcess("target.exe",… , DEBUG_PROCESS, …);

while (1) {

    WaitForDebugEvent(&event, …);

    switch (event) {

        case ModuleLoad:
            Handle/Ignore;
            break;

        case TerminateProcess:
            Handle/Ignore;
            break;

        case Exception: // (code breakpoint, single step, etc…)
            Handle/Ignore;
            break;
    }

    ContinueDebugEvent(…);
}
code }
