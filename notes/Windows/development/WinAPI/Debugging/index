$ Debugging Windows applications

Most Windows → development/debugging[debuggers] use the *debug API* that is provided by *dbghelp.dll*. The most interesting functions of this
→ Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLL] are
  • `DebugActiveProcess()`
  • `WaitForDebugEvent()`
  • `DebugBreakProcess()`

{ Exceptions
 
  When an application that is debugged encounters an *exception* in user mode, the kernel traps the exception and passes it to the (user mode) *exception dispatcher*.
  
  the debugger.
  This seems to be the *first chance* exception.

  If the debugger does not handle the the exception, the *user mode dispatcher* checks for one (or more)
  installed *vectored exception handlers* (VEHs) and calls them until one handles the exception.

  If none of the VEHs handled the exception, the chain of *structured exception handlers* is traversed until
  a SEH is found that handles the exception.

  If none of the SEHs handles the exception, the exception is raised again
