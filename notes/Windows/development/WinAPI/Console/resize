$ WinAPI: resize a console

The following example tries to rudimentarily show how a console can be resized and then be changed to the original size.

{ Required steps

  First, we need to store the `HANDLE` of the *current console buffer* so that we're able to go back to our console when we're done.

  Then, our *new console buffer* needs to be created with `CreateConsoleScreenBuffer()`.

  The new console buffer is then activated with `SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer`.

  Since we want to resize the console, we need to specify the size of the window *and* the size of the buffer (that stores the data that is displayed). The order is relevant:
    • first `SetConsoleWindowInfo` to change the size of the window
    • then `SetConsoleScreenBufferSize` to change the size of the buffer

  Now, the console is resized. We can now write text into the buffer with `SetConsoleCursorPosition` and `WriteConsole`.

  When we want to go back to our original buffer, we need to call `SetConsoleScreenBufferInfoEx` and `SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer`, again in this order.
