@ UWP

The *Universal Windows Platform* (UWP) was introduced with → Windows/versions/10. The UWP provides a common app platform (that is: core APIs) on every device that runs Windows 10.
-
If these core APIs are used, an app will run on any Windows 10 device, such as
  • Desktop PC
  • Xbox
  • Mixed-reality headset
  • …

{ Windows Runtime

  UWP apps use the Windows Runtime.

  The Windows Runime is written in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP{C++] and provided by → Windows.

}
{ Misc

  UWP applications automatically—and dynamically—scale for each display that they're running on.

  All UWP Apps are also Window Apps, but not all Window Apps are UWP Apps. A Window App is not the same as a Win32 App.
