$ TIB - Windows Thread Information Block

The TIB is also referred to as TEB (Thread Environment Block)?

In a Win32 environment, the `FS` â†’ development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[register] always points at the TEB, in a Win64 environment, it's the `GS` register.

Apparently, the TIB is defined in a `struct` named `NT_TIB` in `winnt.h`.
-
The first element is a pointer to (the thread's) `EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION` struct.
-
The second and third elements contain the high and low addresses of the stack.
-
etc.

{ EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION

  The `EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION` struct contains a pointer to a call back function to be called in case of an exception (aka the `_except_handler` callback function).
