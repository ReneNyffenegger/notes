$ Convert bytes to characters in different code pages

The following simple → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C] source code converts the bytes between 128 to 255 to selected
→ Windows/development/code-page[code pages] and writes an HTML file with a → development/web/HTML/tags/table[HTML table] where these can be looked up vertically (same byte) and horizontally (same code page).

The result (written output) is → https://renenyffenegger.ch/development/Windows/code-page/byte-2-char.html[here].
