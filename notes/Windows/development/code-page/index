$ Windows code pages

A *code page* maps the numbers 0 through 255 to a character.

There are two groups of → Windows code pages:
  • OEM: used by *console applications* (→ Windows/console-host[console host]?)
  • ANSI (which is a misnomer and is officially called *Windows code pages*)

The code page for → development/Unicode/UTF-8 is 65001.

sa:
  → Windows/development/code-page/byte-2-char[byte-2-char.c] is a simple C program that converts the bytes between 128 and 255 to selected code pages and the
  write an → development/web/HTML/tags/table[html table].

  In → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe], the code page can be displayed or changed with → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/chcp[`chcp`].
