$ Windows: Native System Service

Apparently, the *Native System Service* are elsewhere also referred to as
  • System calls
  • Native API

{ Nt and Zw prefixes

  Most Native System Service routines come in two versions, one with the prefix `Nt`, the other with the prefix `Zw` (for example `NtCreateFile` and `ZwCreateFile`).

  When called from user mode `NtXYZ()` and `ZwXYZ()` behave exactly the same. In fact, these are aliases.

  In kernel mode, however, these functions are different. The real work is performed by `ZwXYZ()`. The `NtXYZ()` variant first validates the parameters and *then* calls `ZwXYZ()`.

  According to → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/what-does-the-zw-prefix-mean-[Microsoft's documentation], the prefix `Zw` was chosen to
  explicitely mean nothing.
