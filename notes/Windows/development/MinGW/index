{ Not POSIX compliant

  MinGW is designed to build native → Windows binaries.
  
  MingGW links with → Windows/development/CRT[MSVCRT].

  MingGW does not aim at being → Linux/POSIX compliant.

  It seems that this is the main difference to → development/Cygwin which provides a POSIX compliant environment on a machine running → Windows.

}
{ Misc

  → development/Cygwin uses MinGW to build its → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL.

}
{ TODO

  Differences to → Windows/development/MinGW/w64[MinGW-w64] seem to be
    • MinGW-64 has a fully POSIX compliant → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/functions/printf[`printf()`] implementation
    • MinGW only builds 32 bit binaries
