$ EXE: entry point
@ entry point

The entry point of an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[exe] (as well as of a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[dll]) is specified with the
→ Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/options/entry[linker option `/entry`].

The entry point *seems* (!) to have the following signature:
code {
ULONG __stdcall(*)(void* → Windows/development/process/PEB[PEB])
code }

When the entry point is called, the `ebx` → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[register] (x64: `rcx`, because in Win-X64, the first parameter is passed in `rcx`) *seems* (!) to point to the
→ Windows/development/process/PEB[process environment block (PEB)]:
-
As per *RbMm*, the entry point function has one parameter: → https://stackoverflow.com/a/55066512/180275[a pointer to the PEB].

With the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/linker[GNU linker], the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/linker/options[option] to specify the entry point is `--entry` or `-e`.
