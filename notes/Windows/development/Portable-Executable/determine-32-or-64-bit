$ Windows Portable Executable: determine if 32 or 64 bit

A Windows Portable Executable (EXE or DLL) is (nowadays) either compiled for execution in 32 or 64 bit environments. Which it is can be determined, for example with
`→ Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-Visual-Studio/version/edition/VC/Tools/MSVC/version/bin/dumpbin_exe[dumpbin.exe] /headers xyz.dll`. Because its output is rather noisy, the
output might be filtered with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/findstr_exe[findstr]:
code {
C:\> dumpbin /headers xyz.dll | findstr /c:"machine (x"
C:\> dumpbin /headers xyz.exe | findstr /c:"machine (x"
code }

If the output is something like `14C machine (x86)`, the Portable Executable was compiled for 32-bit, if it is something like
`8664 machine (x64)`, it was compiled for 64-bit.
