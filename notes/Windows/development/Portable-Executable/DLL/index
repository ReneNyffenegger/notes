The layout of a DLL is almost the same as that of an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[EXE]. The difference is that the DLL contains an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL/export-table. 

When `DLlMain` is called, `Kernel32.dll` is guaranteed to be already loaded into the process address space.

  Registry: → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-NT/CurrentVersion/Windows#reg-appinit-dlls[`AppInit_DLLs`] lists DLLs to be loaded (»injected«) into
