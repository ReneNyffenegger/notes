$ DLL: export table
@ export table

The *export table* lists the name of every function (»entry points«) in a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL that can be used by other executables.

The export table can be inspected with `dumpbin /exports name-of.dll`.

When creating a DLL, there are two possibilities to create the export table:
  • With a `.def` file
  • Using `__declspec(dllexport)`

Apparently, functions that are exported should follow the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/calling-convention#stdcall[stdcall] calling convention (`__stdcall`).
