$ Creating a DLL with a .def file

The following files try to be a minimal example on how to create a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL with the
→ Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[Visual C compiler] and a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL/export-table/def-file[`.def` file].

{ dll.def

  The def file (`dll.def`) lists the → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL/export-table[exported functions]. We only have one exported function (`add`).

  gh|about-cl|/dll/def/dll.def||

}
{ dll.c

 `dll.c` is the c source file for the dll with the exported function `add`. Note how the function is declared
  with the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/calling-convention#stdcall[`__stdcall` calling convention].

}
{ dll.h

 `dll.h` is the header file which is needed for the executables that use the DLL.

}
{ main.c

 `main.c` is used to create the executable that uses the dll.

}
{ Makefile

  This make file (to be invoked with `nmake`) creates the dll and the executable that uses the dll.
