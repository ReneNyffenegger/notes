  I found a → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C program that I think demonstrates *Virtual Terminal Sequences* quite well
  on Microsoft's site at → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences:
  gh|Windows-development|/Portable-Executable/subsystem/console/virtual-terminal-sequences.c||

  See also → Linux/shell/ANSI-escape-sequences
