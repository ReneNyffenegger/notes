$ Windows subsystems
@ subsystem

A subsystem exposes a subset of the *base Windows executive system services* to applications.

There are a few possible subsystems:
  • native, used for device drivers and native Windows → Windows/development/process[processes]
  • GUI
  • → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem/console[Console]
  • OS2 CUI
  • Posix CUI
  • Native 9x driver
  • Windows CE
  • → hardware/UEFI[EFI] application
  • EFI driver with boot services
  • EFI driver with run-time services
  • EFI ROM image
  • XBOX
  • Windows boot application

When linking, the subsystem is indicated with the → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/link/subsystem[`/SUBSYSTEM`] option.

{ Console vs GUI

  The arguably two most important subsystems are → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem/windows[Windows] and → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/subsystem/console[Console].

  Because console applications are fundamentally different from GUI applications, there are some programs that come in the console and the gui versions:
  → development/languages/Java[Java] has `java.exe` and `javaw.exe`, the → development/languages/WSH[script host] comes with `cscript.exe` and `wscript` and
  devenv has `devenv.com` and `devenv.exe` etc.

  When using → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] (mingw), a console subsystem is created by specifing the
  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/m_lowercase/console[`-mconsole`] option.

}
sa:
  → Windows/versions[Windows 10, version 1607] comes with a *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (developers only). This is not a »real« subsystem like Console or GUI.

  Subsystems are started by → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/smss_exe[`smss.exe`] (Windows Session Manager)

  See also value → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session-Manager/SubSystems#reg-subsystem-required[`Required`] under → Windows/registry[registry] key
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session-Manager/SubSystems[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SubSystems`].
