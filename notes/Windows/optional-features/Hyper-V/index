$ Windows: Hyper-V
@ Hyper-v

Hyper-V provides *hardware virtualization*, that is: each virtual machine run on its own *virtual* hardware, such as virtual hard drives, devices etc.

Hyper-V is available on all but the home edition of 64-bit version of → Windows/versions/10.

Hyper-V is an optional *feature*

If virtualization is enabled, not only the guest operating systems, but the host OS *itself* runs on top of the Hyper-V virtualization layer. Yet, the host OS still has full control over all hardware.
