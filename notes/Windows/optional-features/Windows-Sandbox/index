$ Windows Sandbox

*Windows Sandbox* runs on top of → Windows/optional-features/Hyper-V.

Whenever *Windows Sandbox* is started, it does so in a clean state. This also means that it is impossible to install a software that requires a reboot.
-
That said, → https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview[the docu] states
that as of Windows 11, version 22H2, the data persists through a restart initiated from inside the virtualized environment.

{ Enabling Windows Sandbox
 
  { PowerShell

    With elevated privileges: Check if Windows Sandbox is already enabled (note that the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Dism_exe#dism-available-features[feature] name is `Containers-DisposableClientVM`):
code {
PS:> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/get -online | where-object {$_.featureName -eq 'Containers-DisposableClientVM' }

FeatureName : Containers-DisposableClientVM
State       : Disabled
code }

    Enabling the feature requires to reboot the machine: 
code {
PS:> → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/enable -online -featureName 'Containers-DisposableClientVM' -all

  }
  { After reboot

?   After rebooting, I found the directory `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Containers` which I believe was not there
    before enabling Windows Sandbox.

  }

}
{ Starting a sandbox

  PowerShell:
code {
PS:\> WindowsSandbox.exe
code }

}
{ Exploring the new environment

  Starting a PowerShell session reveals that the (default?) user is *WDAGUtilityAccount*:
code {
PS C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount> function prompt {'PS> '}
code }

  Apart from *Public* and *WDAGUtilityAccount*, there are also the users *ContainerAdministrator* and *ContainerUser*:
code {
PS> ls C:\Users\ | select name

Name
----
ContainerAdministrator
ContainerUser
Public
WDAGUtilityAccount
code }

}

sa:

   Windows Sandbox consists of the two services `CmService.dll` and `vmcompute.exe` and the worker process `vmwp.exe`.
