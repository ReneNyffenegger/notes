$ Different behaviour of envioronment variables in 32-bit and 64-bit processes of Windows (WOW64)

{ print-env-vars.bat

 `print-env-vars.bat` is a simple → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch file] that prints the names and values
  of some → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variables] whose value depends on the bitness of the process that is eavluating them.

{ call-print-env-vars.bat

 `call-print-env-vars.bat` is another batch file that → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/call[calls] the `print-env-vars.bat` batch file twice.
  The first invocation is in the context of the «current» cmd.exe process. For the second invocation, it starts a 32 bit `cmd.exe` process, whose executable is located
  under → Windows/dirs/Windows/SysWOW64[`%SystemRoot\SysWOW64`].

 *If* the calling `cmd.exe` process is a 64-bit process, the difference of the environment variable values becomes visible.
