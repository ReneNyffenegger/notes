$ Windows service: WinRM

*Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)*

WinRM is → Microsoft[Microsoft's] implementation of the *WS-Management Protocol*. This protocol is → development/web/service/SOAP[SOAP] based,
allows systems to access and exchange management information across an IT-infrastructure and handles authentication.

WinRM has superseded DCOM as recommended remote → Windows/Management-Instrumentation[WMI] protocol.

By default, WinRM uses → development/security/kerberos for authentication. So, Windows does not send the password to the system that requests a validation.

The WinRM → Windows/services[service] listens on → development/web/TCP-IP[TCP/IP] port 5985 (by default).
