$ Windows services

A service is an executable (application) that runs in the background, that is, without a → development/GUI and therefore without (direct) interaction with users.

An example for a service is the → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/instance[SQL Server instance].
-
Some Windows components are also implemented as servcices, to name a few:
  • Print spooler
  • → Windows/services/installed/EventLog[Event log]
  • Task scheduler
  • etc.

Some services are run by `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/svchost_exe[%systemroot%\system32\svchost.exe]`.

Information about each service on a system is stored in the → Windows/registry[registry] under
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\ServicesHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`]

It should be noted that Microsoft not only refers to background processes as services, but also to *device drivers*. This is, imho, confusing.

{ Service names

  A service has three names:
    • The → Windows/development/process[process] name
    • The internal name which is used in the → Windows/registry
    • The display name (which is not required - if missing, the internal name is used instead)

}
{ Required components for a service

  A service requires three components:
    • Service Application
    • Service Control Program (SCP)
    • Service Control Manager (SCM)

}
{ Service Control Manager (SCM)

  Services are started, stopped and generally controlled by the *Service Control Manager* (SCM) which is implemented in
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/services_exe[`services.exe`].

  It is possible to communicate with the *Service Control Manager* with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/sc_exe[`sc.exe`] or the
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mmc_exe[MMC] Snap in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/services_msc[`services.msc`].

}
{ Service verbs

  The Service Control Manager communicates to a service basically with the following four verbs:
    • start
    • pause
    • continue
    • stop

  Therefore, a service needs to at least implement these four primitives.

}
{ Searching/displaying services

  { PowerShell

    In order to show installed services on a system or filter them in → Windows/PowerShell,
    one has to use the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/service/get[`get-service` cmdLet].

  }

}
{ User Account

  A service executes in the security context of a → Windows/user-account[user account].

  There are three special predefined local accounts for services. These accounts are not recognized by the *security subsystem* (and hence are not
  look-up-able with `LookupAccountName` and don't have a password).
    • LocalService
    • NetworkService
    • LocalSystem

}
{ Installed services after an fresh Windows 10 installation

   This following table shows the services I found after a fresh installation of → Windows/versions/10[Windows 10].

   The table was extract using `format-table`  to print the full column width:

code {
PS C:\> get-service | format-table -wrap -autosize
code }

  Another way to list services is using → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wbem/WMIC_exe[`WMIC.exe`] in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe]:

C:\> wmic service where "name like '%mssql%'" get name
code }

   → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msconfig_exe[`msconfig.exe`] has a checkbox under the *Services* tab that allows to view

  The value of `NoInteractiveServices` under the → Windows/registry[registry] key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/Windows[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows`]

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/architecture/services/agent

  The → Microsoft/dot-net class → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/ServiceProcess/ServiceController[`System.ServiceController.ServiceController`] represents a service.

  The presence of the → development/tools/Docker/Windows/cexecsvc[cexecsvc] service indicates that an environment is running inside a → development/tools/Docker/container[Docker container].
