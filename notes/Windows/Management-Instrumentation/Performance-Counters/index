$ Windows: Performance Counters

Performance Counters collect data and information related to System resources such as → hardware/CPU, → Windows/development/memory[memory], I/O etc.

The collected data is supposed to help administrators and developers improve performance of system or application.

Performance counters are not intended to be queired more than once per second.

If more frequent sampling is desired, one of the following APIs or methods should be considered:
  • → Windows/development/WinAPI/Diagnostics/Process-Status[Process Status API] (PSAPI)
  • The WinAPI function `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` (`sysinfoapi.h`)
  • The WinAPI functions `GetSystemTimes` and `GetProcessTimes`
  • Collecting → Windows/ETW[ETW] logs with `tracelog.exe` using `-critsec`, `-dpcisr`, `-eflag` or `-ProfileSource` (`tracelog.exe` seems to be included with the WDK and the Windows SDK for desktop apps and located under a path like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22621.0\x64`)

    Consumer ☰ A software that uses the collected data, such as the built-in tools → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Taskmgr_exe[Task manager], → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/typeperf_exe[`typeperf.exe`], → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/resmon_exe[Resource monitor], → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/perfmon_exe[Performance monitor], → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/logman_exe[`logman.exe`] or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/relog_exe[`relog.exe`].
    Provider ☰ A software that creates the data which might or might not be used by a consumer. There are V1 and V2 providers.
    Counterset ☰ A group of performance data of *one* provider
    Counter ☰ A single piece of collected data. A counter has a name and a type
    Counter value ☰ The 32-bit or 64-bit value of a Counter.

  Performance Counters must not be confuseed with the `QueryPerformanceCounter` → Windows/development/WinAPI function.

  → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/bin/version/ctrpp_exe[`ctrpp.exe`] is a pre-processor that parses and validates a Performance Counter V2 manifest.

 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/pcw_sys` is the driver for performance counters.
