$ Windows: set date in process

This is the source code for a simple Windows tool that uses → https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/detours/[Detours] to start a → Windows/development/process and hook
the WinAPI functions `GetLocalTime` and `GetSystemTime` in order to make the started process run under a given time.

The process is started in a command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] or → Windows/PowerShell) like so:
code {
C:\Users\rene> setDate 2001-02-03 04:05:06 path-and-or-name-of.exe
code }

For example, if `path-and-or-name-of.exe` is → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], the time or date is now changed to the given values:
code {
C:\Users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/echo %TIME%
4:05:06.00
C:\Users\rene> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/echo %DATE%
2001-02-03
code }

{ Compilation

  I compiled the program with → Windows/development/MinGW/w64 using → Windows/tools/event-hooking/set-date-in-process#win-set-date-Makefile[this Makefile].
}
{ TODO

  There are a number of other WinAPI functions that return a date or time that also should be hooked:
    • `GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime`
    • `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime`
    • `time` (undocumented and not exposed through → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Windows-Kits/n/Include/version/um/Windows_h[`<windows.h>`] or an import library, found in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/KernelBase_dll/time[`KernelBase.dll`])
    • `NtQuerySystemTime`
    • `GetTimeFormat` (?)

  If this tool is used to start a process that in turn starts another (child-) process, the child process does not «inherit» the time. Therefore, the tool should probably also hook
 `CreateProcess` so that the started process injects the hooking → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL also into the child-process.
