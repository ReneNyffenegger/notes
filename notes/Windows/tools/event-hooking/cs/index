$ Windows: Event hooking with C-Sharp

→ #win-ev-hook-cs-cs[`Win32Hook.cs`] is a → development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] source file that can be used for applications that need to hook keyboard events.

`Win32Hook.cs` can be turned into an → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly[assembly] with → #win-ev-hook-cs-ps1[`create-assembly.ps1`]
(Compare → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/type/add/create-assembly[Creating assemblies with `add-type`]).

An application that uses `Win32Hook.cs` is → Windows/tools/event-hooking/swap-keys/cs[`swapKeys.cs`]: it exchanges the *Caps Locks* key with the *ESC* key.

The sources are hosted in → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cs-Win32-Hook[this Github repository].

  gh|cs-Win32-Hook|/Win32Hook.cs||

}
{ create-assembly.ps1 #win-ev-hook-cs-ps1

 `create-assembly.ps1` creates the → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly from the source code:
  gh|cs-Win32-Hook|/create-assembly.ps1||

  If *Cortex XDR* is installed and `create-assembly.ps1` is run, Cortex will potentially report a «malicious activity» (Cortex XDR Code C0400067).
