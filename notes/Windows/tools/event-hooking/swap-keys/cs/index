$ Windows: swap keys (like ESC and Caps Lock) with a C-Sharp program

→ #cs-swapKeys-cs[`SwapKeys.cs`] is a small → development/languages/C-Sharp keyboard remaping program program that swaps the *Caps Locks* and the *ESC* keys.
-
This program is dependent on → Windows/tools/event-hooking/cs[`Win32Hook.cs`] (which is found in
→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cs-Win32-Hook[this Github repository]).

The program can be compiled and run with → #cs-swapkeys.ps1[`load-swapKeys.ps1`].

On a computer, I ran into a problem in which the program would crash once in a while. Therefore, I also wrote → #cs-swapKeys-startAgain[`startAgain.bat`], 
a simple → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch file] which continuously restarts the program.

The sources of `SwapKeys.cs`, `load-SwapKeys.ps1` and `startAgain.bat` are found in → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cs-SwapKeys[this Github repository].

A similar program, but written in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C, is → Windows/tools/swap-keys_c[`swap_keys.c`].

{ SwapKeys.cs #cs-swapKeys-cs

}
{ load-SwapKeys.ps1 #cs-swapKeys-ps1

 `load-SwapKeys.ps1` expects that the dependent `Win32Hook.dll` → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly was already created with
  → Windows/tools/event-hooking/cs#win-ev-hook-cs-ps1[`create-assembly.ps1`] (→ Windows/tools/event-hooking/cs[Event hooking with C#]).

{ startAgain.bat #cs-swapKeys-startAgain

  gh|cs-SwapKeys|/startAgain.bat||

}
{ install-autorun.ps1 #cs-swapkey-install

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] adds the `startAgain.bat` → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[batch file]
  to the → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`] registry
  → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key so that the keys are automatically remapped when the → Windows/user-account#win-user-log-in[user logs on].
