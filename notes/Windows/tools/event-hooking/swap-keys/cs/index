$ Windows: swap keys (like ESC and Caps Lock) with a C-Sharp program

→ #cs-swapKeys-cs[`SwapKeys.cs`] is a small → development/languages/C-Sharp program that swaps the *Caps Locks* and the *ESC* keys.
-
This program is dependent on → Windows/tools/event-hooking/cs[`Win32Hook.cs`] (which is found in
→ https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cs-Win32-Hook[this Github repository]).

The program can be compiled and run with → #cs-swapkeys.ps1[`load-swapKeys.ps1`].

On a computer, I ran into a problem in which the program would crash once in a while. Therefore, I also wrote → #cs-swapKeys-startAgain[`startAgain.bat`], 
a simple → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch file] which continuously restarts the program.

The sources of `SwapKeys.cs`, `load-SwapKeys.ps1` and `startAgain.bat` are found in → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cs-SwapKeys[this Github repository].

A similar program, but written in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C is → Windows/tools/swap-keys_c[`swap_keys.c`].

}
{ load-SwapKeys.ps1 #cs-swapKeys-ps1

 `load-SwapKeys.ps1` expects that the dependent `Win32Hook.dll` → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly was already created with
  → Windows/tools/event-hooking/cs#win-ev-hook-cs-ps1[`create-assembly.ps1`] (→ Windows/tools/event-hooking/cs[Event hooking with C#]).
