$ Sysinternals tool: PsExec / PSExec64

{ Viewing protected registry keys #psexec-view-registry

  The → Windows/registry[registry] keys
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SAM[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM`] and
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SECURITY[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`]
  are protected by the *System accunt*. Thus, they cannot be examined even by members of the
  Administrator group.

  In order to be able to navigate to these keys, → Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`] must be started as *System*.

  This is possible with the `-s` and `-i` options of *PsExec64*. `-s` indicates to run the executable in the System accunt, `-i` specifies that it interacts with the desktop.

code {
PsExec64 -s -i regedit.exe
code }
