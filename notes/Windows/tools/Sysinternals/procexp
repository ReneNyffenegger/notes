$ Sysinternals tool: procexp / procexp64

The → Windows/development/process[process] explorer.

Unique features of the process explorer (Windows Internals, 7th edition):
  • A process security token, such as lists of groups and privileges and the virtualization state
  • Highlighting to show changes in the process, thread, → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs], and handles list
  • A list of → Windows/services[services] inside service-hosting processes, including the display name and description
  • A list of additional process attributes, such as mitigation policies and their process protection level
  • Processes that are part of a job and job details
  • Processes hosting .NET applications and .NET-specific details, such as the list of AppDomains,
  • loaded assemblies, and CLR performance counters
  • Processes that host the Windows Runtime (immersive processes)
  • The start time for processes and threads
  • A complete list of memory-mapped files (not just DLLs)
  • The ability to suspend a process or a thread
  • The ability to kill an individual thread
  • Easy identification of which processes were consuming the most CPU over a period of time

The process explorer is able to show symbol names (function names) on a process's thread's stack if configured with the *symbols* (Debugging tools for Windows).
