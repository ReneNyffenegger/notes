{ Directories are just a special type of files

  Internally, NTFS treats folders as a special type of file.

{ Symbolic links #ntfs-symlinks

  A symbolic link (aka symlink) is essentially a pointer to a file or a directory

  In → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], a symlink is created with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/mklink[`mklink`], in
  → Windows/PowerShell with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/new[`new-item … -itemType symbolicLink` cmdLet].

  Apparently, administrator rights are required to create a symbolic link unless Windows is put into → Windows/development/developer-mode[developer mode].

  NTFS has symlinks since → Windows/versions[Windows Vista].
