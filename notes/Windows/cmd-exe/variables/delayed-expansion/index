$ cmd.exe - delayed variable expansion

With enabled delayed variable expansion, the exlamation point character specifies to substitute the value of an
→ development/environment-variable[environment variable] at run time rather than at »compile« time.

When → Windows/cmd-exe[`cmd.exe`] is started, *delayed variable expansion* is enabled or disabled by giving either the
`/v:on` or `/v:off` → Windows/cmd-exe#cmd-exe-options[option].

In a → Windows/cmd-exe/batch-files[batch file], delayed variable expansion can be enabled with → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/setlocal[`setlocal enableDelayedExpansion`].
