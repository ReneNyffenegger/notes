$ cmd.exe

{ Starting cmd.exe

  A way to start `cmd.exe` is to press `Win+R` and then type `cmd+ENTER`.

  On *Windows 10*, it can also be started by pressing `Win+X` followed by `C`. (However, this can be changed in *Settings -> Taskbar*: the option *Replace Command Prompt with Windows → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] …* needs to be turned off for this.

  When `cmd.exe` is started *without* `/D`, it first executes the commands that are listed in the → Windows/registry[registry] under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Command-Processor[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`] and
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` (value of `Autorun`).

{ Changing the size of the cmd.exe window

  { Using the mode command

    The size of the current cmd.exe wincow can be changed with the `mode` command:
code {
mode con: cols=200 lines=70
code }

    However, this does also(?) set the buffers size to 70 which is not what I usually want.

    Apparently, the previous command can be shortened to the equivalent(?)
code {
c:\> mode 200,70
code }

  }

{ TODO

  The development/environment-variable[environment variable] `%ComSpec%`.

  The *actual console program* behind cmd.exe is `conhost.exe`.

  → https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon[ANSICON] promises ANSI escape sequences for Windows console programs,
  similarly as ANSI.SYS did for MS-DOS.
