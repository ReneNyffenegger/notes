$ cmd.exe: Windows' command prompt
@ cmd.exe

{ Starting cmd.exe

  A way to start `cmd.exe` is to press `Win+R` and then type `cmd+ENTER`.

  On *Windows 10*, it can also be started by pressing `Win+X` followed by `C`. (However, this can be changed in *Settings -> Taskbar*: the option *Replace Command Prompt with Windows → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] …* needs to be turned off for this.

{ Changing the size of the cmd.exe window

  { Using the mode command

    The size of the current cmd.exe wincow can be changed with the `mode` command:
code {
mode con: cols=200 lines=70
code }

    However, this does also(?) set the buffers size to 70 which is not what I usually want.

    Apparently, the previous command can be shortened to the equivalent(?)
code {
c:\> mode 200,70
code }

  }
