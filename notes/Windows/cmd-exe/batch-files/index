{ Exiting batch files #exit-batch-file

  If → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/exit[`exit`] is used to terminate a batch file, the `/b` option must be specified in order not to terminate the
  → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe] session as well.

{ Pausing for a while

  Sometimes, it's necessary to pause execution of the script for a few seconds (or longer). → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/timeout_exe[`timeout.exe`] is explicitely created for that.

  The following line pauses for 5 seconds:
code {
timeout /t 5 > nul
code }

}
