$ cmd.exe: the setlocal command

`setlocal` localizes changes that are made to the environment. The changes are reverted back with `endlocal`.
`setlocal` is affected by whether → Windows/cmd-exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled or disabled.

`setlocal` has no effect when not used in a → Windows/cmd-exe/batch-files[batch file].


{ Changes to environment variables

  The following example → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/set[sets] a variable, then uses `setlocal` to go into a localized environment where it changes the value of the variabe, and
  then leaves the localized environment with `endlocal` and → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/echo[prints] the value of the variable again.
