$ cmd.exe: goto

{ Let the user choose an option

  The following example  uses → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/set/p[`set /p`] to print *Choose either foo, bar or baz!* and assign the entered option to the 
  → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `%chosen%`.

  It then uses → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/if[`if … equ …`] to compare the entered value to the hard coded values `foo`, `bar` or `baz`. Depending on the chosen value, the `if` statement
  then uses `goto` to jump to a *label* which simply prints what the user has chosen.
