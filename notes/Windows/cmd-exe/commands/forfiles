$ cmd.exe: forfiles
@ forfiles

{ Find files depending on their modification date

  Find files that are younger than Novemeber 13th, 2018. This is on a swiss computer, I assume that the date is regionallanguage dependent:
code {
f:\> forfiles /s /d +13.11.2018
code }

  Similiarly, files that are older than a date can be found using a `-` instead of a `+`:
code {
f:\> forfiles /s /d -13.11.2018
code }

}

sa:

  → Windows/cmd-exe/commands

  The shell command → Linux/shell/commands/find[`find`]
