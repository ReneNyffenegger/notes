$ cmd.exe - pushd
@ pushd

`pushd dir-name` pushes the current directory (→ development/environment-variable#cd[`%CD%`]) onto the *directory stack* and → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/cd[`cd`s] into the directory given as paramter (`dir-name`).

The opposite command is → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/popd[popd] which gets and removes the most recently directory name off the directory stack and `cd`s back to that directory.

`pushd` is affected by whether → Windows/cmd-exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled or disabled.
