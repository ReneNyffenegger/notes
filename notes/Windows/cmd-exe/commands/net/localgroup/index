$ cmd.exe: net localgroup

`net localgroup` is used to administer a *local group* on a computer. In contrast, to modify *global groups in domains*, → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/net/group[`net group`] is used.

{ Show members of the (local) Administrators group

code {
net localgroup Administrators
code }

  This command shows the members of the (local) Administrators group. If I am listed in them, I have administrator permissions on the machine.

  In order to check in what groups I am, I can use → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/whoami_exe[`whoami /groups`].

}
{ Adding a user to the Administrators group

  The following command adds user *Rene* to the *Administrators* group:
code {
net localgroup Administrators Rene /add
code }

}
