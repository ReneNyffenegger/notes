$ cmd.exe - mode
@ mode

{ Change the size of the cmd.exe window

  The size of the current cmd.exe wincow can be changed with the `mode` command:
code {
mode con: cols=200 lines=70
code }

    However, this also seems set the buffers size to 70 which is not what I usually want.

    Apparently, the previous command can be shortened to the equivalent(?)
code {
c:\> mode 200,70
code }


}

{ TODO

  Changing the → Windows/development/code-page[code page]: `mode con: cp select=…`. Compare with → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/chcp[`chcp`].
