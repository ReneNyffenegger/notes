$ cmd.exe: Determine if it running in a 32 or 64 bit environment

{ Using %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTUR% and %PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432%

  In → Windows/cmd-exe, the → development/environment-variable[environment variables] `%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTUR%` to report the *native processor architecture* if the system is not running under *WOW64*.
  -
  The value of this variable apparently is either `AMD64` or `x86`.

  `%PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432` can only be used for WOW64.

  See David Wang: → https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/david.wang/2006/03/27/howto-detect-process-bitness/[HOWTO: Detect Process Bitness].

}
{ Using %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%

  Another approach seems to be to check if the environment variable `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)` (not the directory it points to) exists.

  On 32-bit systems, the variable is not defined.

{ With wmic

  In an *elevated commanc prompt*, `wmic` can be used:

code {
wmic os get osarchitecture
code }

}
