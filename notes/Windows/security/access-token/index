$ Windows: access token

When a → Windows/user-account[user] logs on, Windows creates an *access token* for this user.

Such an access token stores the following information
  • The user's → Windows/security/SID[SID] (security identifier)
  • The SIDs of the groups that the user belonged to when the user was authenticated
  • A logon SID which identifies the current *logon session*
  • The user's and groups' privileges
  • An owner SID
  • The SID for the primary group
  • The default *discretionary access control list* (DACL) that is used when the user creates a securable object (without an explicit *security descriptor*)
  • The source of the access token
  • A flag that indicates if the token is a *primary* or an *impersonation* token
  • A list of *restricting SIDs* (optional)
  • Current impersonation levels
  • Other statistics
