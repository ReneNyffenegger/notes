$ Windows Credential Manager

→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmdkey_exe[`cmdkey.exe`] allows to access the Credential Manager from the command line
(→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell]).

Two (different) GUI versions of the Credential Manager can be opened with one of the following two commands
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/rundll32_exe[rundll32] keymgr.dll,KRShowKeyMgr
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[control] keymgr.dll
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[control] /name Microsoft.CredentialManager
code }

The Credential Manager can be opened from the → Windows/control-panel[Control Panel] -> *User Accounts* -> *Credential Manager*.

Credentials can be backed up or restored from a *Credential Backup File* (→ development/filename-extensions#crd[`.crd`]) with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/credwiz_exe[`credwiz.exe`].

{ TODO

  Does the credential manager store passwords under `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SECURITY/Secrets`?

}

  An answer to a → https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119765[question on SE Information Security] suggests that the credential manager is not
  secure at all.
