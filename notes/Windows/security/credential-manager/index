{ Accessing the Credential Manager

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmdkey_exe[`cmdkey.exe`] allows to access the Credential Manager from the command line
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell]).

  Two (different) GUI versions of the Credential Manager can be opened with one of the following two commands
code {
C:\> → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL/rundll32_exe[rundll32] keymgr.dll,KRShowKeyMgr
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/control_exe[control] keymgr.dll
code }

  The Credential Manager can be opened from the → Windows/control-panel[Control Panel] -> *User Accounts* -> *Credential Manager*.

  An answer to a → https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119765[question on SE Information Security] suggests that the credential manager is not
  secure at all.
