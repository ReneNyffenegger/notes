  { Effective permissions on objects

    Objects, such as files, → Windows/registry[registry] keys, → Windows/services[services], → Windows/development/process[processes], kernel objects etc. can be assigned
   *effective (?) permissions*.

    These permissions can be viewed with the Sysinternal command line tool `AccessChk` (and `AccessEnum` for registry keys and files/directories).
