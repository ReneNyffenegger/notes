The Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) is mainly used to *symmetrically* encrypt asymmetric private keys using a user or system secret as a significant contribution of entropy. 

The DPAPI keys to encrypt a user's RSI keys are stored under `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Protect/S-1-5-21-X`.

  DPAPI is used for example to encrypt the → development/databases/SQL-Server#sql-server-security[the *database master key* of SQL Server].
