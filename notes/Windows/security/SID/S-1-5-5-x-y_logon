$ Windows: Logon SID (S-1-5-5-x-y)

Each → Windows/development/session is associated with a logon → Windows/security/SID. These SIDs have the format `S-1-5-5-x-y`. `y` is randomly generated, the meaning of `x` is unkown to me.
-
`x` and `y` are guaranteed to be unique for each session *until* → Windows is → Windows/booting[restarted]. Then, these numbers can be recycled.

sa:
 On the command line, the logon sid can be queried with `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/whoami_exe#win-whoami-logonid[whoami /logonid]`.
