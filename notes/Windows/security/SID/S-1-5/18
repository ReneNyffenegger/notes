$ S-1-5-18 (NT Authority\System)
@ S-1-5-18

`S-1-5-18` is the well-known → Windows/security/SID for the *SYSTEM* account. This account is sometimes also referred to as *Local System*.

The SYSTEM account is used by → Windows itself and by → Windows/services[services] that run under Windows.

Because this account is internal, it is not shown in the user manager. However, it *is* being shown when in a file's property dialog under the *Security* tab…

The SYSTEM account has full control over all files in an → Windows/file-system/NTFS drive.

{ Becoming SYSTEM

  Some objects, such as the registry keys → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SAM[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM`] and → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SECURITY[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY`]
  can only be accessed by SYSTEM.

  { Sysinternals/PsExec64

    A possibility to become SYSTEM is to use the → Windows/tools/Sysinternals tool → Windows/tools/Sysinternals/PsExec64[`PsExec` or `PsExec64`]:
code {
→ Windows/tools/Sysinternals/PsExec64#psexec-become-SYSTEM[PsExec64 -s -i] cmd.exe
code }

  }
  { Starting cmd.exe instead of osk.exe #cmd-exe-instead-of-osk-exe

    The registry key `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-NT/CurrentVersion/Image-File-Execution-Options/progName_exe` allows to set a
    → development/debugging[debugger] to be started when `progName.exe` is invoked.

    The following change in the registry defines `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe` as debugger for `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/osk_exe`:
    gh|about-Windows-Registry|/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/Image File Execution Options/osk.exe-debugger-cmd.exe.ps1||

    Now, we need to have Windows (i. e. `SYSTEM`) to start `osk.exe`. This can be achieved by having the → Windows/security/User-account-control[UAC prompt] displayed, for example by starting
   `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe`.

    When the UAC prompt is shown, the → Windows/keyboard-shortcuts[Windows shortcut key] `Windows + O` allows to select *On-screen keyboard*. This selection starts `osk.exe`, but since a debugger, `cmd.exe` is defined for this executable, the debugger,
    i. e. `cmd.exe` is started as `SYSTEM`:
code {
C:\Windows\System32> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/whoami_exe[whoami]
nt authority\system
code }

    It must be noted that the registry keys below `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows-NT/CurrentVersion/Image-File-Execution-Options` are protected by → Windows/security/defender[Defender]. So, in order to
    be able to change the value, the respectice Defender Setting must be disabled under
    → Windows/settings/Update-Security/Windows-Security/Virus-and-Thread-protection/Tamper-protection[Settings -> Update & Security -> Windows Security -> Virus & Threat protection -> Tamper protection] by turning off *Real-time protection*.

  }
  { Utilman.exe

    Another *hack* is to → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Utilman_exe#Utilman-replace-cmd[replace `Utilman.exe` with `cmd.exe`].

  }

}
