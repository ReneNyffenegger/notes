$ Windows security identifiers (SID)

A SID is a variable-length numeric value with the following parts:
  • structure revision number
  • authority value (48 bits), which identifies the issuer of the SID (usually a local Windows system or a domain)
  • a list of subauthority or relative identifiers (RIDs), each 32 bit.
When represented as string, the SID starts with `S-` and the parts are separated by a hyphen.

A name is just a more readable representation of a SID. The Sysinternal tool → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psgetsid[PsGetSid] is able to translate between
SIDs and names.

Windows recognizes users (and his → Windows/development/process[processes]) and other *security principals* by the user's SID.

SIDs are fundamental for Windows security.

Each user's SIDs is unique accross all Windows installations.

That said, there are *well known SIDs*:
  • `S-1-0-0`: The *null SID*
  • `S-1-1-0`: World, which is the group that *all* → Windows/user-account[users] belong to.
  • `S-1-2-0`: *Local*
  • `S-1-2-1`: *Console Logon*
  • `S-1-3-0`: *Creator owner id*
  • `S-1-3-1`: *Creator group id*
  • `S-1-3-2`: *Creator owner server*
  • `S-1-3-3`: *Creator owner group*
  • `S-1-3-4`: *Owner rights*
  • `S-1-4`: *Non unique Authority*
  • `S-1-5`: *NT Authority*
  • `S-1-5-80`: *all → Windows/services[services]*
  • `S-1-5-18`: The SID for the *local system account*.
  • `S-1-5-32-546`: The *Guests group*


sa:
  The computer's SID is stored in the → Windows/registry[registry] under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SECURITY/SAM/Domains/Account[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\SAM\Domains\Account`]
