*Windows Patch Protection (KPP)* prevents → Windows/kernel[Kernel] structures (64-bit editions of) → Windows from being modified, either unwanted or maliciously.
-
Such protected structure include
  • System Service Tables
  • The interrupt descriptor table
  • The global descriptor table
  • Kernel stacks (that are not allocated by the kernel?)
  • Code in the kernel itself, or in the → Windows/architecture/HAL or NDIS kernel libraries.

When KPP detects unwanted code, it crashes the system with the code `0x109` (`CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION`).
