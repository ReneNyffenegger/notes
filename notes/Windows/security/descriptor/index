$ Windows: security descriptor
@ security descriptor

A *security descriptor* stores some security related information about → Windows/development/objects[object] such as
  • ownership
  • who is allowed to execute which action on the object
  • which actions are audited

All objects that are managed by *Active Directory* and all *securable objects* on a local computer or on the network have a security descripter. 

An object can have two types of access control lists:
  • DACL: Discretionary access control list to identifiy → Windows/user-account[users] and → Windows/user-account/group[groups] that are allowed or denied access
  • SACL: System access control list to store information on how auditing is performed.
