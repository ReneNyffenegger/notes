$ Windows 10 S

*Windows 10 S* is primarily aimed at non-technical users.

Some limitations, IMHO, are
  • apps can only be installed from → Microsoft/Store to Windows 10 S.
  • There is no command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`], → Windows/PowerShell)
  • …
 
sa:
  → Windows/versions/10
