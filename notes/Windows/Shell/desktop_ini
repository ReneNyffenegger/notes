{ Referencing an icon in dll

  The following example tries to demonstrate how an icon in a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL can be referenced:

code {
[.ShellClassInfo]
IconFile=→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/imageres_dll[%windir%\System32\imageres.dll]
IconIndex=233
InfoTip=Hello World
code }

}

  It's also possible to reference a bitmap or icon file:
code {
[.ShellClassInfo]
IconFile=32x32.bmp
IconIndex=0
code }

}
