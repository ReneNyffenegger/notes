$ Windows Shell

{ Shell objects

  Shell objects include
    • files, directorys
    • … ?

  Shell objects can be right clicked to open a context menu that allows to perform actions that are specific to the shell object.
  -
  These actions are also referred to as *verb*.

  The same verbs are also used as parameter to the function → Windows/development/WinAPI/Shell#winapi-ShellExecuteEx[`ShellExecuteEx()`]

}
{ Shell namespace extensions

  The Shell can be extended with *namespace extensions*. These allow to customize the functionality of the → Windows/dirs/Windows/explorer_exe[Explorer], for example displaying a list of virtual items in a directory.

  Technically, suchy namespace extensions are → Windows/development/COM/object[COM objects].

  { Required interfaces and classes

    A namespace extension consists of two classes.
  
    One of these classes needs to implement the following interfaces
      • `IShellFolder`
      • `IPersistFolder`

 ?  The other class needs to implement `IShellView` and stub
      • `ICommDlgBrowser`
      • `IOleWindow`
      • `IShellBrowser`

    See also → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/CurrentVersion/Shell-Extensions/Approved[`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Approved`]

  }

}
{ Shell instance object

  A *Shell instance object* is a *Shell namespace extension* that does not need its own → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL because evertyhing it needs is provided by
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/shdocvw_dll[`shdocvw.dll`].

  The information needed to created a Shell instance object is found in the → Windows/registry.
