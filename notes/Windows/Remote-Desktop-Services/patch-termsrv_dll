$ Patching termsrv.dll with PowerShell for multiple simultaneous sessions to non-Windows Server with RDP

When using → Windows/Remote-Desktop-Services to connect to → Windows/versions/Server[non-Windows-Server] edition, at most one remote user can be connected to the remote Windows computer.
However, it is possible to lift this restriction by patching (replacing some bytes in) → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/termsrv_dll[`termsrv.dll`].

The following → Windows/PowerShell script tries to do that. It hopefully goes without saying that you are using the script at your own risk and I cannot be held responsible for any damages caused.
