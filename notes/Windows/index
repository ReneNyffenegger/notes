  { Default user profile win-default-user-profile

    The *default user profile* id duplicated when a new *user account* is created. A default user profile includes special folders such as *My Documents* and *Desktop*.

    Apparently, at least part of the default user profile is stored under → Windows/dirs/Users/Default.
