  In → Windows/PowerShell, a value can be created or modified with → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/itemProperty/set#set-itemProperty-registry[`set-itemProperty`].

}

  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/itemProperty[itemProperty]. Thus, in order to create a new registry value, the
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/itemProperty/new[`new-itemProperty` cmdLet] is needed.
