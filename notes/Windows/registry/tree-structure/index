$ Windows registry: tree structure

The → Windows/registry[registry] consists of a few → Windows/registry/tree-structure/root[trees] and can therefore be considered a «hierarchical database».

The nodes in the tree are → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[keys], the leaves are → Windows/registry/tree-structure/value[values]. Thus, a key consists of (potentially zero) keys (which are ~subkeys~ to that key) and of (potentially zero) values.

The ~names of the keys~ are not case sensitive and cannot include the backslash `\` nor the NUL `\0` character and cannot be empty.

The ~names of the values~ can contain the backslash or can be empty.

A key can have an (unnamed) → Windows/registry/tree-structure/default-value[default value]. With → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/reg_exe[`reg`], these need the `/ve` flag.

A key has a 64-bit FILETIME object that contains the `LastWrite` value. The → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/UserAssist[UserAssist] keys
maintain timestamps with their data.
