{ Querying a specific value in the registry

  `req query` in combination with `/v` can be used to query for a specific value under a specific key in the → Windows/registry[registry].

  The following command determines the (system wide) value of the `PATH` → development/environment-variable[environment variable].

code {
reg query → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session-Manager/Environment["HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment"] /v PATH
code }

  Unfortunately, `reg query` also prints the key and data type of the queried value. In order to only print the value, the `reg query` might be combined with
  → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/for/f/tokens[`for /f "tokens=…"`] to extract the value only. On the command line, that would be:
code {
for /f "tokens=2,* skip=2" %a in ('reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v TEMP') do echo %b
code }

  If this construct is used in a *batch file*, the percent signs need to be doubled (`%%a` and `%%b` instead of `%a` and `%b`), see
  for example → development/tools/scripts/personal/regQuery_bat[`regQuery.bat`].

{ Escaping special characters #reg-escape

  Apparently, apostrophes can be escaped with a backslash and percent signs can be escaped with a caret (`^`).
