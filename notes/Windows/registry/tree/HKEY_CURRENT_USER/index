$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER` (HKCU) manages settings for the currently logged-in user.

Technically, `HKCU` is a link to a subkey of `HKEY_USERS`.

? On Windows NT systems, the settings for each user are stored in the files `NTUSER.DAT` and `USRCLASS.DAT` which reside in ther *Documents and Settings* folder (or *user* folder in Windows Vista and later?).
(Is this `%userprofile%\NTUSER.DAT`?)
