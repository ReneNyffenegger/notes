$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console` is used to configure the → Windows/console-host (which in turn influences
→ Windows/cmd-exe or → Windows/PowerShell).

{ Set the console's host width and height

  The following batch file sets the console's host width and height.

  There are two registry values that store width and height for the console host: `WindowSize` and `ScreenBufferSize`. The former specifies for the actual displayed size on the screen while
  the latter controls the internally stored size of buffer.

  The new height must be multiplied with 65536 and then the width needs to be added. The script accomplishies that using the
  → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/set/a[`set /a`] command.
