$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox

{ Default value

  The default value seems to store the currently installed version of the → development/web/browser/Firefox[Firefox browser] without bitness and
  → development/locale, for example `65.0.2`.

}
{ CurrentVersion #reg-hkcu-firefox-currentversion

  This value *seems* to store the currently installed version of the → development/web/browser/Firefox[Firefox browser] with bitness and locale, for example `65.0.2 (x64 en-US)`.

}
{ TODO

  Is this the correct name of the key or should it be `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla\fox`?

}
