{ Docking the VB Editor Immediate Window to the bottom #reg-dock-vb-editor

  Apparently, if the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window[Immedate Window] had been undocked with a stupid movement, it's impossible (at least for me) to
  dock it to the bottom the VB Editor again by dragging it around on the screen or so.

  Yet, deleting the → Windows/registry[Registry] key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\7.0\Common\Dock` followed by a restart of the
  → Microsoft/Office[Office] application places it at the bottom again.
