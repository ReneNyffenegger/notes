$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` can be used to configure → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe].

{ Autorun #reg-cmd-exe-autorun

  If → Windows/cmd-exe[cmd.exe] is started *without* the → Windows/cmd-exe#cmd-exe-options[`/D` option], it executes the commands that are listed in the `Autorun` value first.

 `Autorun` can also be specified in the respective key under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`].

  Compare with → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`].

  If the value contains the name of a → Windows/cmd-exe/batch-files[batch file], extreme care needs to be taken that this batch file does not contain any command that starts
  another instance of `cmd.exe`, such as the → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/for/f[`for /f "usebackq" …`] construct. Otherwise, cmd.exe is instantiated recursively.
  -
  Should that happen nevertheless, the created cmd.exe → Windows/development/process[processes] *might* be killed with a
 `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/taskkill_exe[taskkill] /im cmd.exe /f`.


}
{ CompletionChar / PathCompletionChar

  The value specifies the ANSI(?) number of the key to be pressed to complete a file name or directory name when editing the command line.

  Setting it to 9 for both allows to complete file and directory with the tabulator.

}
{ EnableExtensions

  If set to 1, → Windows/cmd-exe/command-extension[command extensions] are enabled by default.

}
