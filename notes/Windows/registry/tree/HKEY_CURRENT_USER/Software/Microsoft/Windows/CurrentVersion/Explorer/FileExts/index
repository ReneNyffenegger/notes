  { Calculating hash for UserChoice\Hash

    Apparently, Windows calculates a hash after assingning a default application that handles files with a given file extension. This hash is stored in the value `Hash` under the subkey `UserChoice`.

     → https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17946282[this Stackoverflow question] has some insteresting answers and notes concerning this hash, such as:
  "
    Microsoft decided in Windows 8 (probably for security reasons) that users
    should be able to set default programs only via the built in GUI. I.e. by
    design, you are not supposed to be able to set default handlers in a script
    or programmatically.
  "

     Another answer lays out the algorithm for calculating the hash like so:
code {
extension  = “.txt”                                          ; The file extension
sid        = “S-1-5-21-463486358-3398762107-1964875780-1001” ; The → Windows/security/SID of the current → Windows/user-account[user]0
progid     = “txtfile”                                       ; The → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId[ProgId] of the desired association
regdate    = “01d3442a29887400”                              ; The timestamp of the UserChoice → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key]
experience = “a microsoft secret string”                     ; A static string (this is a dummy example, not the real string

hash       =  → development/Base64[Base64](MicrosoftHash(MD5(toLower(extension, sid, progid, regdate, experience))))
code }

   This stackoverflow also links to → https://kolbi.cz/blog/2017/10/25/setuserfta-userchoice-hash-defeated-set-file-type-associations-per-user[this page] where an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[.exe] can be downloaded
   that apparently is able to calculate this hash.

   → https://github.com/DanysysTeam/SFTA[This github repository (Dansys/SFTA)] contains a PureBasic program that seems to indicate that `experience` is `User Choice set via Windows User Experience`.
   -
   On the other hand, using `strings` on `SetUserFTA.exe` reveals this string plus a → development/UUID-GUID[GUID]: `user choice set via windows user experience {d18b6dd5-6124-4341-9318-804003bafa0b}`.
