$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit
@ HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit` is the
→ Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] that is used by
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`] to write its persistent → development/Data.

{ LastKey

  One very interesting → Windows/registry/tree-structure/value that is stored under this key is
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Applets/Regedit/LastKey[`LastKey`]: it stores the location of the last
  visited key with `regedit.exe`.

  This value is used when `regedit.exe` is started again to open the registry at the given key.

  When `regedit` is closed, it writes the value of the open key with this format: `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft` (i. e. no colons, backslashes and prefixed with `Computer\`).
  -
  The `Computer\` prefix is not necessary when writing the value. In Windows 11, `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` can be abbreviated with `HKLM`, `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` with `HKCU` and `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` with `HKCR`.
  

  The PowerShell script → development/tools/scripts/personal/regat[`regat.ps1`] writes a given value to this value and then starts `regedit` (which then opens at
  this given key).

}
{ Favorites

  The subkey → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Applets/Regedit/Favorites[`Favorites`] stores registry-paths in order to quickly access them in
  `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe` in the menu → Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe#regedit-favorites[Favorites].
