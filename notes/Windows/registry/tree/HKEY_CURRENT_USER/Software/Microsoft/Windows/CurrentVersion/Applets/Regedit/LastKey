$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit: LastKey

The `LastKey` value under the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit` key stores the last opened key with
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`].
When regedit is started, it shows the key that this value points to.
-
Thus, by changing the value in `LastKey` prior to invoking regedit, it's possible to specify which key regedit is going to show.

sa:

 `→ development/tools/scripts/personal/regat_bat`: A → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe] batch file that changes the value and then runs `regedit.exe`.
  -
 `→ development/tools/scripts/personal/regat` is the same idea but for → Windows/PowerShell.

  → development/tools/scripts/personal/op-reg-at_pl[`op-reg-at.pl`], a → development/languages/Perl script that changes `LastKey`.
