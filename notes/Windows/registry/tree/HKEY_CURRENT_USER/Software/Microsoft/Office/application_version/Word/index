{ Resetting all word options and configurations

  A radical way to reset all word options and configurations seems to be to delete *this very key* when → Microsoft/Office/Word[Word] is not running. In order to have a fall back, it might be a better
  idea to rename this key so that Word does not find it and creates a new one.

  After resetting the options, they might be → Microsoft/Office/Word/configure-options[re-created with PowerShell]
