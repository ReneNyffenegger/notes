$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\X.Y\Word\Data

{ Settings

  Settings is a *binary* value that seems to store the options (such as *auto correct*, spelling settings etc.)

  Since the value is binary, its at best difficult to change the settings directly in the → Windows/registry[registry].
  -
  However, they can be → Microsoft/Office/Word/configure-options[changed with PowerShell].
