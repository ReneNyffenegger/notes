$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\X.Y\Word\Data

The `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\X.Y\Word\Data` → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] stores *most recently used* lists, such as
  • most recently used file list
  • most recently used address book list

In additon, this key also stores settings about
  • track changes
  • edit

The data is stored in binary format.

{ Settings

  Settings is a *binary* value that seems to store the options (such as *auto correct*, spelling settings etc.)

  Since the value is binary, its at best difficult to change the settings directly in the → Windows/registry[registry].
  -
  However, they can be → Microsoft/Office/Word/configure-options[changed with PowerShell].
