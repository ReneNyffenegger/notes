$ Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\International\User Profile

{ Languages #reg-user-profile-languages

  The value is a list that is → development/line-break[new line] separated, such as
code {
en-CH
en-US
de-CH
en-GB
code }

  Each of these values seem to correspond to an equally named → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[subkey].
  
  This list seems also to be returned by the → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[PowerShell] cmdlet → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/winUserLanguageList/get[`get-WinUserLanguageList`].

  TODO: How is it related to → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Keyboard-Layout/Preload[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload`]
