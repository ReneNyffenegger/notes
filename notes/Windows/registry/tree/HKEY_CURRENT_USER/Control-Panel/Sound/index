  … however, setting `ExtendedSound` to `no` didn't have the epxected result. Actually, I am not even sure what it changed or changes.

{ Relation to beep service / restarting the computer

  The relation (if any) to the *beep* → Windows/services[service] is unclear.

  Some site suggest to stop or restart the beep service after making a change to this key in order to apply the changes with immediate effect.

  However, I found that I could not stop the beep service, the service hangs after stopping it:
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/sc_exe[sc stop] beep

SERVICE_NAME: beep
        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
        STATE              : 3  STOP_PENDING
                                (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0

C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/sc_exe[sc queryex] beep

SERVICE_NAME: beep
        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
        STATE              : 3  STOP_PENDING
                                (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
        PID                : 0
        FLAGS              :
code }

  Thus, it seems, to me at least, that I have to restart the computer to apply the changes.

{ TODO

  What is the relation to → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/AppEvents/Schemes/Apps[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps`] and
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mmsys_cpl[`mmsys.cpl`]?
