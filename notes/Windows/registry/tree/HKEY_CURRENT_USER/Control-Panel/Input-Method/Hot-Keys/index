{ Subkeys

  The names of the subkeys of eight-digit hexadecimal numbers, left padded with zeroes.

  I have no idea if these names have a special meaning.
  - 
  That said, → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/embedded/ms904626(v=msdn.10) makes some notes about the keys in
  the range `00000000` through `00000027` thar are used for *simplified chinese mspy…*.


  { Values of Subkeys


  The subkeys seem to have the following three values:
    • Key Modifiers
    • Target IME
    • Viertual Key

  These three values have the `REG_BINARY` data type and are four bytes long.


    { Virtual key

      The virtual key that needs to be pressed to change the keyboard layout.

    }
    { Key modifiers

      The virtual key that needs to be pressed can be modified with a *key modifier*:

      The first byte indicates which modifier keys need to be pressed:
       • 01: Left alt
       • 02: control
       • 04: shift
      
       Valid combinations seem to be
         • Left alt (= 0x01)
         • control + Shift (= 0x06)
         • Left Alt + Shift (= 0x05)
 
       The second byte always seems to be `0xC0`, the third and fourth `0x00`.


    }
    { Target IME

      Somehow, the value of `Target IME` seems to correspond to a → Windows/development/Internationalization/language[language identifier].

    }
  }
