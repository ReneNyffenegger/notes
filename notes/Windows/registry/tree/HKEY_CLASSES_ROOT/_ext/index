$ Registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ext

The key `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ext` allows to associate a file type (which apparently is identified by its file name extension such as `.mp3`, `.txt` or more generally `.ext`) with an (existing) application. This application
is identified by *ProgId* which is stored in the → Windows/registry[registry] under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ProgId`].

The *ProgId* is determined by the *default value* of `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ext`.

{ TODO

  Why do I all of a sudden have the subkey → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[subkey] `OpenWithProgid`?

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/commands/assoc[`assoc` (cmd.exe)].
