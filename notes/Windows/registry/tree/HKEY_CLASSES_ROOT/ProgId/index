$ Registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ProgId

A *ProgId* is an identifier that can be associatd with a CLSID and thus references a → Windows/development/COM[COM] class.

The format of *ProgId* is `<program>.<component>.<version>`, for example `Excel.Application.15`. Apparently, the `.version` part is not mandatory.

The → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] of that CLSID is stored under the respective default value for
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId/CLSID[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<ProgId>\CLSID`].
