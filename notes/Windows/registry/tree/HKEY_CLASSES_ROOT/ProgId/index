$ Registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ProgId

A *ProgId* is a user-friendly (that is: readable) identifier that is associatd with a CLSID and thus references a → Windows/development/COM[COM] class.
-
Unlike CLSIDs (which are → development/UUID-GUID[guids]), ProgIds are not globally unique.

The format of *ProgId* is `<program>.<component>.<version>`, for example `Excel.Application.15`. Apparently, the `.version` part is not mandatory.

The → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] of that CLSID is stored under the respective default value for
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/ProgId/CLSID[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<ProgId>\CLSID`].

The *ProgId* might be referenced as *default value* from a *file type key* (→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/_ext[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ext`]) in the registry.

The *ProgId* is used in the → development/languages/VBA[`VBA`] and → development/languages/VBScript[VBScript] statement `→ development/languages/VBA/functions/createObject[createObject](prog_id)`.
