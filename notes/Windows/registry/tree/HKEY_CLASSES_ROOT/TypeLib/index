$ Registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib

`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib` stores information about → Windows/development/COM/type-library[type libraries]. This key has → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[subkeys] each of which is a → development/UUID-GUID[GUID]
(referred to as *libUUID*) and each subkey describes one(?) type lib.

These libUUIDs are (or might be?) referenced by the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/default-value[default value] of under the key `→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID/GUID[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID{CLSID-GUID}\TypeLib`.

Usually, type libs are files with the → development/filename-extensions#tlb[`.tlb`] or → development/filename-extensions#olb[`.olb`] (where olb is an → Microsoft/Office type library, *but* the *o* stands for object, not for Office).

{ Registry entries

  A subkey below the libUUID subkey is the version of the type library in `major.minor` form.
  
  These (or some of these?) entries are created by calling `RegisterTypeLib` in a → Windows/development/COM/type-library.

  In a Visual Basic for Application project, references to a type library can be added with → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference#VBIDE-add-reference[`….references.addFromGUID(…)`].

{ PowerShell script to list type libraries

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] iterates over the type libraries that are registered in the Registry and prints their libUUID, version (major.minor), name and the file system
  path of the type library itself.
