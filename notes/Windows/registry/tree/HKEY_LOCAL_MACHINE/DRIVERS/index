$ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\DRIVERS

The → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\DRIVERS` is interesting because it doesn't show up in
→ Windows/dirs/Windows/regedit_exe[`regedit.exe`].
-
However, its possible to demonstrate its existence on a console with
code {
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/reg_exe[reg] query HKLM
C:\> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/reg_exe[reg] query HKLM\DRIVERS
code }

sa:
  The → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/devmgmt_msc[Device Manager (`devmgmt.msc`)]
