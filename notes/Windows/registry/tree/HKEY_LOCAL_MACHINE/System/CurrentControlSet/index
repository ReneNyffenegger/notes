$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet

The *control set* records information needed to run a system, such as about hardware or → Windows/services[services] etc.

→ Windows stores at least two *control sets* in the → Windows/registry[registry]:
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/ControlSet00x[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001`] and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002`. Usually, both of them have the same information.
-
However, if a fundamental change is made to the system such as a change of the hardware, there is the possibility that Windows cannot boot up anymore because of a faulty entry in the registry's control set.
Thus, only one of the copies is changed.
-
If Windows manages to boot up correctly, it copies the newer control set over the older so that both are in sync again.

The registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet` is just a link to one of the two *real* control sets: the one that is currently loaded.

The current control set is recorded in `Current` under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Select[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Select`].
