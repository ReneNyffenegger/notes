$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet

The *control set* records information that is needed to → Windows/booting[start Windows] and device related information that is used to run Windows (→ Windows/services[Windows Services]).

→ Windows stores at least two *control sets* in the → Windows/registry[registry]:
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/ControlSet00x[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001`] and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002`. Usually, both of them have the same information.
-
However, if a fundamental change is made to the system such as a change of the hardware, there is the possibility that Windows cannot boot up anymore because of a faulty entry in the registry's control set.
Thus, only one of the copies is changed.
-
If Windows manages to boot up correctly, it copies the newer control set over the older so that both are in sync again.

The registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet` is just a link to one of the two *real* control sets: the one that is currently loaded.

The current control set is recorded in `Current` under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Select[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Select`].

Some → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[subkeys] below `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet` are
  •  Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Control[`Control`]
  •  Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Enum[`Enum`]
  • `Hardware Profiles`
  •  Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services[`Services`] stores information about each → Windows/services[Windows service] on a system.

{ Showing that CurrentControlSet and one of the ControlSet00x is equal

  The following script is invoked by passing two registry keys. The script then writes a value under one registry key and tries to read it from the other key. It then reports
  if both keys are the same.
  -
  The following invocation showed that `CurrentControlSet` and `ControlSet001` were indeed the same key on my machine:
code {
C:\> is-same-registry-key.bat "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001" "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet"
code }
