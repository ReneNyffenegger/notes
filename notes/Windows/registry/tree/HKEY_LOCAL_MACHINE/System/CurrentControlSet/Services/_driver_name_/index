$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\driverName

Each subkey under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`] names (or identifies) a driver.

The driver may use this subkey to store data it needs.

When the *PnP manager* initializes a driver with its `DriverEntry()` function, it passes to the function the registry-path of this key.

The (optional) → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/_driver_name_/Parameters[Parameters] subkey stores *driver specific* data.

The (optoinal) subkey *Performance* is used for performance monitoring.


{ ImagePath #reg-services-imagePath

 `ImagePath` stores the fully qualified path to the drivers *image file*.

  Usually, the value is something like `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers[%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\driverName.sys`].

  At times, however, a reference to → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/svchost_exe[`svchost.exe`] is also seen, for example:
  -
 `%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p`

  This value is created by the mandatory `ServiceBinary` entry of the drivers's `.inf` file.

}
{ Start #reg-services-start
 
  Start specifies how or when a service is started:
    • 0: Loaded (but not started) by the boot loader. Then started during → Windows/kernel initialization.
    • 1: Started during kernel initialization after services whose start parameter is 0.
    • 2: Automatically. Started by → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/smss_exe[`smss.exe`] (session manager) or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/services_exe[`services.exe`] (services controller).
    • 3: Manually. Started by the → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/services_exe[Service Control Manager] (SCM).
    • 4: Disabled
    • 5: Delayed start.

  The start value of 1 indicates that that this is a kernel device or other low-level hardware device driver.

  For adapters, the start value is ignored.

  A convenient way to dislable *and* remember the original startup type (for later enabling again) for services is provided
  by → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msconfig_exe[`msconfig.exe`] under the
  by → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msconfig_exe#msconfig-exe-disable-services[Services tab].


}
{ Type

  The type value specifies the type of the service:
    • 0x01: Kernel device driver
    • 0x02: File system driver (which is also a kernel device driver)
    • 0x04: Set of arguments for an adapter
    • 0x10: A Win32 program that can be started by the *service controller* and that obeys the service control protocol.
    • 0x20: A Win32 service that can share a process with other Win32 services.
    • 0x60: USER_SHARE_PROCESS TEMPLATE
    • 0xE0: USER_SHARE_PROCESS INSTANCE
