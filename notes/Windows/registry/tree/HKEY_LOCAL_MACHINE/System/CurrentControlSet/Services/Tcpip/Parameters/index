{ DataBasePath #DataBasePath

  The default value of `DataBasePath` is → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/drivers/etc[`%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc`]

}
{ KeepAliveTime #KeepAliveTime

  The value of `KeepAliveTime` determines the interval in milliseconds on idle connections before TCP sends a keep-alive transmission (which is used to determine if the other participant in the TCP connection is still responsive).

  The default value seems to be 7200000 which equals to 2 hours.

  This value is possibly → https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1115172/keepalivetime-registry-setting-for-windows-server[not used anymore].

  As per Oracle's MOS Note 226202.1, TCP Keep Alive needs to be active to prevent dead sessions from accumulating when SQL*Net Dead Connection Detection (`SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME`) is
  set to 0 or unset in the `sqlnet.ora` file.

  See also section *4.2.3.6 TCP Keep-Alives* in → development/web/RFC#rfc-1122[RFC 1122].
