{ Reading values with PowerShell

  → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] allows to → Windows/PowerShell#ps-env-variables[access the values] under this key with
code {
PS> echo [environment]::getEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "machine" )
PS> [environment]::setEnvironmentVariable("ANOTHER_VAR", "another value", "machine") 
code }

}
{ PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE #reg-processor_architecture

 `PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE` can be used to → Windows/cmd-exe/tasks/determine-if-32-or-64-bit-Windows[determine the bitness of the CPU]. If it contains `x86` (or even `x86 Family`), it's a
  32 bit processor, if it contains `64 Family`, it's a 64 bit processor.

  Note, 32 bit applications running on 64 bit Windows (→ Windows/WOW64) seem to overwrite this variable in the process (not in the registry) with `x86`.
