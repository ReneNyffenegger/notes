 → Windows/development/environment-variables/PROCESSOR/ARCHITECTURE[`PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE`]
  can be used to → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/tasks/determine-if-32-or-64-bit-Windows[determine the bitness of the CPU]. If it contains `x86` (or even `x86 Family`),
  it's a 32 bit processor, if it contains `64 Family`, it's a 64 bit processor.

  Note, 32 bit applications running on 64 bit Windows (→ Windows/WOW64) seem to overwrite this variable in the → Windows/development/process[process] (not in the → Windows/registry) with `x86`.
