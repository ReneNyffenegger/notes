{ Changing the keybaord layout programatically

  In order to change values under this registry key, administrator privileges are needed. Sometimes, they are not granted, effectively
  making it impossible to change the keyboard layout in the → Windows/registry[registry].

  However, it's possible to programmatically create a keyboard hook to change scan codes on the fly. Such a program is
  → Windows/tools/swap-keys_c[`swap_keys.c`].
