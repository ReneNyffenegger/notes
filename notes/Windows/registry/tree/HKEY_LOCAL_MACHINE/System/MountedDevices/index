$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices

This → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] is used to store some information about each drive (device) that was plugged into a → Windows system. Among this information is the drive
letter that was assigned to this drive. Thus, if a drive is used again, it ensures that the same drive letter is assigned to the drive. (I don't know what happens if two drives are plugged in that
had the same drive letter at different time points in the past).

The stored settings can be removed with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mountvol_exe[`mountvol.exe /r`]
