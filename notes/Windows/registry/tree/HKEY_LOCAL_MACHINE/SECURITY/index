$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY` stores the *Lsass policy database*. This database contains local system security policy settings which controls, among others,
  • which → Windows/user-account/domain[domains] are trusted to authenticate → Windows/user-account#win-user-log-in[logon attempts]
  • which users are allowed to access the system
  • on what channels these users are allowed to access the system (interactive, network, service logons)
  • which → Windows/security/privileges[privileges] are assigned to a user
  • how users are audited
  • logon information for cached domain logons and → Windows/services[service] logons

The values for `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY` are physically stored on the harddisk in the file → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/config/SECURITY.

In order to see anything, SYSTEM (= LocalSystem ?) privileges are needed. This is possible with the → Windows/tools/Sysinternals tool → Windows/tools/Sysinternals/PsExec64#psexec-view-registry[PsExec].
