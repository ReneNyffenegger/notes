`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets` stores LSA secrets such as
  • RAS/VPN passwords
  • autologon passwords
  • other system passwords

{ TODO

  Does the → Windows/security/credential-manager store its password under this registry key?

  Can these secrets be queried with the following functions (of `advapi32.dll`)
    • `LsaRetrievePrivateData`
    • `LsaStorePrivateData`
    • `LsaOpenPolicy`
    • `LsaNtStatusToWinError`
    • `LsaClose`
    • `LsaFreeMemory`
