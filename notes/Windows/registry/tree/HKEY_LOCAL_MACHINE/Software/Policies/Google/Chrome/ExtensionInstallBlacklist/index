$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\ExtensionInstallBlacklist

This registry can be used by an adminstrator to prevent a user from installing a specific extension into Chrome. If unallowed, the user trying to install an extension
gets the message *Extenion (extension ID “xxxxxxx”) is blocked by the administrator*.

In order to unallow *all* extensions, the value `*` can be used. This setting can then be overridden with a list of allowed extensions in
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Policies/Google/Chrome/ExtensioninstallWhitelist[`ExtensioninstallWhitelist`]
