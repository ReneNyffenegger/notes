{ Virtual Junction Points

 `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer` may contain sub keys that define *junction points* which make its root folder a subfolder of a *system virtual folder*

  Among(?) such virtual junction points are
    • → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/ControlPanel[ControlPanel]
    • Desktop
    • Entire Network
    • NetworkNeighborhood
    • RemoteComputer

  A sub key that acts as a virtual junction point needs to have a subkey that is named `NameSpace`.
