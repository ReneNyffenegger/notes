$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

This key stores the information needed to uninstall a (properly) installed program (software) or application.

Each uninstallable application is stored in a subkey whose name sometimes is a → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] (in curly braces).

{ Uninstall software from the command line

  { WMIC

    Apparently, it's possible to uninstall software with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wbem/WMIC_exe[wmic.exe].

    The first query is used to display all installed (and uninstallable) software. With its result, the second
    command allows to specifically uninstall a package.

    For a reason I don't really understand, the first query takes quite some time to complete.

code {
c:\> wmic product get caption, installDate, vendor
c:\> wmic path win32_product where "name = '<< caption found with previous command >>'" call uninstal
code }

  }
  { MsiExec

  ? It also seems possible to uninstall a software by its GUID with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/msiexec_exe[`MsiExec`]:
code {
C:\> MsiExec /X{AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE}
code }

  }

}
{ Listing uninstallable software

  The following → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] iterates over the kyes in `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` and its cousin under the
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Wow6432Node[`HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node`] to list all uninstallable software along with some additional information:
  gh|about-Windows-Registry|/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Uninstall/list-applications.ps1||

}

  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Installer[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer`]

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/appwiz_cpl
