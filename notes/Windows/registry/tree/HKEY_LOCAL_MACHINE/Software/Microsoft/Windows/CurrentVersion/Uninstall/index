{ Uninstall software with wmic

  Apparently, it's possible to uninstall software with → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wbem/WMIC_exe[wmic.exe].

  The first query is used to display all installed (and uninstallable) software. With its result, the second
  command allows to specifically uninstall a package.

  For a reason I don't really understant, the first query takes quite some time to complete.

code {
c:\> wmic product get caption, installDate, vendor
c:\> wmic path win32_product where "name = '<< caption found with previous command >>'" call uninstal
code }

}
