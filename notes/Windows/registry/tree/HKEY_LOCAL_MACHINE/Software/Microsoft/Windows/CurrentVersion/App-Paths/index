$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths

Used to register and control the behavior of the system on behalf of applications.

With Windows 7 and later, the preferred location is not under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` but rather under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths`.
