$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

{ ConstentPromptBehaviorAdmin

  Setting this value to `0` allows administrators to perform operations that require elevation without the respective annyoing popup prompt.

}
{ EnableLUA #reg-uat-enablelua

  Setting `EnableLUA` to `0` (zero) disables → Windows/security/User-account-control[User Account Control] (UAC), that is, users are not prompted for a confirmation when a program is about to perform an operation
  that requires administrator privileges.

  This key is called EnableLUA because User Access Control was previously called Limited User Account (LUA).

  The following → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`cmd.exe` batch file] sets the value to zero and thus diables UAC:
