$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

The commands that are listed under the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`] → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[subkey] are executed either
  • immediately after a device has been installed
  • when → Windows/booting[Windows starts up] (the commands are not executed if Windows is started in *safe mode*)

After running these commands, they're removed (hence the name *run once*).

The commands must only call → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/rundll32_exe[`rundll32.exe`], otherwise, WHQL won't digitally sign a driver package.

If the commands are prefixed with a star, they're executed when Windows starts up even in safe mode.
