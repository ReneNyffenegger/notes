$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\vv.v\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines

The → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines` stores initialization settings for the `msjet40.dll` database engine, which
is used to query or communicate with → development/databases/Access databases. On my computer, I found `msjet.dll` under → Windows/dirs/Windows/SysWOW64[`C:\Windows\SysWOW64`].

}
{ SandBoxMode

  The value of `SandBoxMode` controls which functions will be allowed to be called. The value can be set to an integer between `0` (most permissive) and `3` (least permissive):
  table { ll
    0 ☰ Sandbox mode is disabled at all times.
    1 ☰ Sandbox mode is used for Access, but not for non-Access programs.
    2 ☰ Sandbox mode is used for non-Access programs, but not for Access.
    3 ☰ Sandbox mode is used at all times. This is the default value
  table }

  The default value is `3` and is set when Access is installed.
