$ Registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW643Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

Except two exceptions, the directories that are stored under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW643Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion` are
by default the same as those under
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion`]
-
The two exceptions are `CommonFilesDir`  which point to → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Common-Files rather than → Windows/dirs/Program-Files and
`ProgramFilesDir` which points to → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86 rather than → Windows/dirs/Program-Files.
