$ Windows registry

The registry consists of a few trees (»hierarchical database«).

The nodes in the tree are ~keys~, the leaves are ~values~. Thus, a key consists of (potentially zero) keys (which are ~subkeys~ to that key) and of (potentially zero) values.

The ~names of the keys~ are not case sensitive and cannot include the backslash `\` nor the NUL `\0` character and cannot be empty.

The ~names of the values~ can contain the backslash or can be empty.

Values have ~data~ associated with it. This data is of one of the following types:
  • REG_SZ: a nul terminated string
  • REG_EXPAND_SZ: a nul terminated string with the names of → development/environment-variable[environment variables] embeded between percent signs (`%`).
  • REG_BINARY: A blob
  • REG_MULTI_SZ: A sequence of nul terminated strings.
  • REG_DWORD: a 4 byte integer value.

Each tree's root key is identified by a constant whose name starts with `HKEY_`:
  • HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
  • HKEY_CURRENT_USER
  • HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  • HKEY_USERS
  • HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA
  • HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
  • HKEY_DYN_DATA
There is not a *single* root key above these tree's root keys.
