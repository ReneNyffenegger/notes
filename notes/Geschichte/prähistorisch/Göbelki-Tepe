    • Notably lacking were detailed human representations, except for a few coarse or eerie figurines, and the T-stones themselves, which seem to be stylised invocations of men, their arms ‘angled’ to protect the groin.
    • Gobekli Tepe upends our view of human history. We always thought that agriculture came first, then civilisation: farming, pottery, social hierarchies. But here it is reversed, it seems the ritual centre came first, then when enough hunter gathering people collected to worship – or so I believe – they realised they had to feed people
    • We have found no homes, no human remains. Where is everyone, did they gather for festivals, then disperse … As we speed around the arid slopes he explains how scientists at Karahan Tepe, as well as Gobekli Tepe, have now found evidence of homes.
    • Some time in 8000 BC the creators of Gobekli Tepe buried their great structures under tons of rubble. 
    • Archaeologists at Gobekli have also, more recently, found tantalising evidence of *alcohol*: huge troughs with the chemical residue of fermentation, indicating mighty ritual feasts, maybe.
    • Another unnerving oddity is the curious number of carvings which show people with *six fingers*.
