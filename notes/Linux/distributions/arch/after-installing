$ After installing arch linux


{ Enable wifi

code {
sudo wifi-menu
code }

}
{ Connecting to a digital camera

code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo[sudo] → Linux/distributions/arch/pacman[pacman] -S gphoto2
code }

code {
gphoto2 --auto-detect
code }

  The last commmand prints something like
code {
Model                          Port                                            
----------------------------------------------------------
USB PTP Class Camera           usb:001,009 
code }

  Apparently, it should now be possible to open or connect to the camere with dolphin (a file manager?) and entering `gphoto2://[usb:001,009]` as address. However, it doesn't. It complained
  that *konqueror* was missing. Even installing konqueror didn't help. So... wtf.

  A better and easier way seems to be to use gphoto2's shell:
code {
gphoto2 --shell
code }

}
