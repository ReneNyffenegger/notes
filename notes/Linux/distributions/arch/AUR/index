$ Arch Linux User Repository
@ AUR

→ https://aur.archlinux.org/.

AUR packages rely on the *base-devel* group being installed.


{ Yaourt

 *Yaourt* is outdated(!) and was used as interface to the AUR (Yaourt = Yet AnOther User Repository Tool).

  Yaourt is installed with → Linux/distributions/arch/pacman:
code {
pacman -Sy yaourt
code }

  Sync yaourt with the AUR:
code {
yaourt -Syy
code }

}

sa:
  → Linux/distributions/arch/AUR/helpers

  → Linux/distributions/arch/pacman

 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/makepkg_conf` is used to set build-optimazation settings for building AUR packages.
