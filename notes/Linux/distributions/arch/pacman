pacman is the *package manager* for → Linux/distributions/arch[Arch Linux].

A system is usually updated with `pacman -Syu` (`-S` = *Synchronize packages*, `-y` = *Refresh master package database* (as defined
in → Linux/fhs/etc/pacman_conf), `-u` = *restrict to out of date packages*)
-
If `pacman -Syu` returns an *error: … signature from … is unknown trust*, executing `pacman -key --refresh-keys` might help.

{ Finding packages #pacman-finding-packages

  `pkgfile` is a tool for searching *files* from packages in the 
  → https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Official_repositories[official repositories].
  -
  Installation:
code {
sudo pacman -S pkgfile
code }

 Updating its database (apparently stored under → Linux/fhs/var/cache/pkgfile/):
code {
pkgfile -u
code }

  Searching for the package:
code {
pkgfile Date.pm
code }

  If the search via `pkgfile` does not find a package, there's a chance that it can be found
  on the → Linux/distributions/arch/AUR.

  Then there's also the → https://www.archlinux.org/packages/[Arch linux package search].

}
{ Databases

  Apparently there are three (default?) databases from where pacman gets the packages: core, extra and community.

}
{ Mirrors

  → https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/status/[Mirror status]

  → https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist[Mirror list generator]

  Local update of mirror list (→ Linux/fhs/etc/pacman_d/mirrorlist): `pacman -Sy pacman-mirrorlist`

}
