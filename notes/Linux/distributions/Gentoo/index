{ Profile #portage-profile

  A *profile* is a set of configuration files stored in `/var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles` that
    • specifies the default state of USE flags,
    • sets default values for most variables found in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/portage/make_conf`,
    • defines a set of system packages, and
    • selects available package versions.

? The currently used profile is pointed at by the (symbolic link?) `/etc/portage/make.profile`

  A profile is selected at installation time, *according to the intended use of the system*.

  A profile is set with `eselect`.
  -
  A list of profiles is produced with the command `eselect profil e list`.

{ Kernel configuration

  There are two ways to configure the → Linux/kernel[Kernel]:
    • automatic (`genkernel`)
    • manual

 `genkernel` is a relatively dumb script and leaves several things to the user, such as WIFI or 3D video acceleration (but see also the `-menuconfig` option of genkernel).

  As an alternative to Kernel configuration, there is also the → https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Distribution_Kernel[Distribution Kernel].

{ Gentoo Linux Enhancement Proposal (GLEP) #gentoo-glep

  A GLEP is a document that provides information or describes a new feature to the Gentoo community.

  GLEPs are very similar to → development/languages/Python/PEP[Python's PEPs].

  Interesting GLEPs include:
    • → https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0023.html[23: Handling of `ACCEPT_LICENSE`] (See also `→ Linux/fhs/etc/portage/make_conf`)
