{ Install git

  Open a terminal (`ctrl-alt-t`).

code {
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install git
→ Linux/shell/commands/mkdir -p ~/github/github
→ development/version-control-systems/git/commands/clone[git clone] https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/PostLinuxInstallation ~/github/github/PostLinuxInstallation
cd ~/github/github/PostLinuxInstallation/dot-files
. _setup.sh

cd ~/github/github/PostLinuxInstallation/install/git
./config.sh
code }

   Apparently, the «standard» approach does not install the newest git version…

   An → https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/170831/6479[answer on unix.stackexechange] suggests to execute
code {
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git -y
git --version
code }

  *Of course*, the `apt-get update` command results in:
code {
W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net/git-core/ppa/ubuntu kinetic InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A1715D88E1DF1F24
E: The repository 'http://ppa.launchpad.net/git-core/ppa/ubuntu kinetic InRelease' is not signed.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
code }

  → https://itsfoss.com/solve-gpg-error-signatures-verified-ubuntu/[This blog] suggests to add the public key to my(?) system with
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A1715D88E1DF1F24
Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.g6AmEDGffS/gpg.1.sh --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A1715D88E1DF1F24
gpg: key A1715D88E1DF1F24: public key "Launchpad PPA for Ubuntu Git Maintainers" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
code }

   With the imported public key, I am now able to execute `sudo apt-get update`, but `sudo apt-get install git -y` results in
code {
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 git : Depends: libc6 (>= 2.34) but 2.28-10+deb10u1 is to be installed
       Depends: libpcre2-8-0 (>= 10.34) but 10.32-5 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
code }

  This is when I gave up.

*cifs-utils* are needed: `sudo apt-get install cifs-utils`.
