$ Ubuntu: Install driver for Epson WF-7610

{ Another trial, 2016-06-20

  → http://askubuntu.com/a/635519/24230[This link] *finally* seemd to help.

code {
sudo apt-get -f install
sudo apt-get install printer-driver-escpr
code }

Then, add printer via Dash(?) -> Printers, *add Network Printer*, selecting *Epson WF-7610 ...* and choosing connection *LPD/LPR queue 'PASSTHRU'*.

  Download epson-printer-utility_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb

code {
sudo dpkg -i epson-printer-utility_1.0.0-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb 
code }



}

   Maybe, → https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Epson-Drucker_und_-Multifunktionsgeräte/ works better?

   The article says, ~lsb~ is not available anymore. (WTH is lsb anyway). So it tries to install it like so
code {
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lsb
sudo add-apt-repository  -r "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main"
code }
This *seemed* to work, but what do I know.



   I followed → #trial-2016-06-20 until the point where I downloaded the rpm package, but this time, I downloaded the deb package instead.

   Double clicking the deb file and clicking *Install* twice (!) *seemed* to install the package, but again: what do I know.

   But then, I was unable to finish the installation.

   Google for → https://www.google.ch/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=download+wf+7610+driver+linux[download wf 7610 driver linux].
   -
   First link was → http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=233679&infoType=Downloads
   -
   Choose operating system *Linux* and click further through the links that make the most sense.

   The *again*, I had to enter *WF-7610*. It took me to → http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/du/02/DriverDownloadInfo.do?LG2=EN&CN2=&DSCMI=45429&DSCCHK=eaf97ae6689ee7a594faa68cb24949fb6569b055

   Obviously, an LSB package (3.2 or higher) is also needed. However, `sudo apt-get install LSB` reports *Unable to locate LSB*.

   → http://askubuntu.com/a/765406/242303 recommends to `sudo apt-get install alien` and then download the *rpm* (!?) package and install
   it with 
code {
sudo alien -i epson-printer-utility-1.0.0-1lsb3.2.x86_64.rpm
code }

  Of course, this would *not* work, as so many times before.
