$ Installing Debian

Some notes on installing debian on a x64_86 notebook (taken March 2024)

{ Prepare installation media

  Find *amd-64-netinst.iso* link on → https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/ and download file to USB stick (make sure that → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[`/dev/sda`] *is* referring to the USB stick:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo → tools/cURL[curl] -L  https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-12.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso -o → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[/dev/sda]
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sync
code }

}
{ Boot from installation media

  Boot from the USB stick on destination notebook (or PC, for that matter).

  I chose «Install» from this menu:
    • Graphical install
    • Install
    • Advanced options …
    • Accessible dark contrast installer menu …
    • Install with speech synthesis

  Other decisions I made:
    • Language: English
    • Country: Switzerland  (does it influence or create the symlink `→ Linux/fhs/etc/localtime`  to `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/zoneinfo[/usr/share/zoneinfo]/Europe/Zurich`?)

  The installer said that there was no → Linux/locale defined for the selected combination of language and country and proposed «United States - en_US.UTF-8» which I accepted.

  Keymap: American English.

  In installed BTFRS without → Linux/swap-space/index#linux-swap-files[swapfile] (I couldn't decide if *with* or *without* swapfile was the better decision, → https://askubuntu.com/a/1206161[this askubuntu answer]
  and → https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swapfile.html[this BTRFS readthedocs page] made me ultimatly forgo using the swapfile.

  Apparently, if needed, I can create a swapfile with something like
code {
$ sudo btrfs filesystem mkswapfile --size 8G /swapfile
$ sudo swapon                                /swapfile
$ cat /proc/swaps
code }

  { Misc

    Console 4 (`alt+F4`) shows installation output.

  }
}
{ Software selection

  *Xfce* and *standard system utilities*.

}
