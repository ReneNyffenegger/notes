$ Linux timezone

The → Linux/kernel[kernel's] timezone is set by → Linux/shell/commands/hwclock[`hwclock`]. Apparently, however, almost nobody cares what the kernel thinks what timezone it is in.
-
Programs that need the local time usually rely on more traditional ways to determine the timezone: The → development/environment-variable#tz or → Linux/fhs/etc/localtime (see `man tzset`).
A noteable exceptions are filesystems that seem to use the kernel timezone.

The kernel's timezone consists of two parts (fields):
  • tz_minutes_west that specifies how many minutes the local time lags behind → misc/UTC[UTC] (not adjusted for DST)
  • tz_dsttime to indicate the type of daylight savings time (DST) (Always zero in Linux(?), see `man 2 settimeofday`)

{ Listing timezones

  Available timezones will be shown with
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/timedatectl --list-timezones
code }

}
{ Temporarily show the date in a different timezone

The time zone can temporarily be set by changing the → development/environment-variable#tz environment variable:
code {
TZ=Linux/fhs/usr/share/zoneinfo[/usr/share/zoneinfo/Antarctica/Palmer → Linux/shell/commands/date
code }

See also → Linux/shell/commands/faketime[`faketime`] and the *datefudge utilities.
