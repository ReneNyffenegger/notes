$ Linux timezone

The → Linux/kernel[kernel's] timezone is set by → Linux/shell/commands/hwclock[`hwclock`]. Apparently, however, almost nobody cares what the kernel thinks what timezone it is in.
-
Programs that need the local time usually rely on more traditional ways to determine the timezone: The → development/environment-variable#tz or → Linux/fhs/etc/localtime (see `man tzset`).
A noteable exceptions are filesystems that seem to use the kernel timezone.

The kernel's timezone consists of two parts (fields):
  • tz_minutes_west that specifies how many minutes the local time lags behind → misc/UTC[UTC] (not adjusted for DST)
  • tz_dsttime to indicate the type of daylight savings time (DST) (Always zero in Linx(?), see `man 2 settimeofday`)
