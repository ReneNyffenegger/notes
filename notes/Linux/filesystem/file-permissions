{ setuid - setgid

  
  { Directories

    *setuid* on a directory does nothing special on a directory and is disabled on almost all unixes.

    *setgid* on a directory makes new files and directories created in that directory inherit the directories gid rather than the creator's gid.
    It also eanbles shared workspaces for groups.
