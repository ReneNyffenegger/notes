$ sysfs

*The* filesystem for exporting kernel object. It provides information about the kernel like → Linux/fhs/proc/[`/proc`], but is better structured (as it follows the formalism of *kobject infrastructure*).

sysfs is a ram-based filesystem initially based on → Linux/filesystem/ramfs. It provides a means to export kernel data structures, their attributes, and the 
linkages between them to userspace. 

sysfs is tied inherently to the → Linux/kernel/kobject infrastructure.
