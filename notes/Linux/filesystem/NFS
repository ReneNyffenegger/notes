abbr: Network File System

The most ubiquitous *distributed* file system - one of the oldest still in use.

An *NFS Server* lets a porition of its local file system be accessed by other nodes. These nodes (the *clients*)
mount that portion.

{ Advantage

The *advantage* for the client is that he does not be aware of his using NFS, he can use `open`, `close` etc as
he does with his local files.

}
{ Limitations #limitations

  There are at least four limitations with NFS:

  1) The total size of the files of an NFS mount is limited to storage capabilities of the server.

  2) No high availability - What happens, if the server goes down?

  3) If there are many clients, there might be performance bottlenecks when they simultaneously try to
  read from or write to the server.

  4) Finally, the client need to transfer the data to their local machine

  â†’ development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS tries to solve these limitations.
