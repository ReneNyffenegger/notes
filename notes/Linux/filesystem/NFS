abbr: Network File System

The most ubiquitous *distributed* file system - one of the oldest still in use.

An *NFS Server* lets a porition of its local file system be accessed by other nodes. These nodes (the *clients*)
mount that portion.

{ Prerequisites

  All network → Linux/user[users] have the same UID.

  Using a *time synchronization daemon* is strongly recommended: the clocks in an NFS network should be kept synchronized to eliminate undesired delays.

}
{ Configuration

  { Server Access control

    The clients that are allowed to access files on the servers need to be entered into → Linux/fhs/etc/exports.

    After modifying `/etc/exports`, the file needs to be re-read with → Linux/shell/commands/exportfs. `-r` stands for *re-read*, `-a` for *all* (of → Linux/fhs/etc/exports).
code {
sudo → Linux/shell/commands/exportfs -ra
code }
    Alternatively, the server might be → #restart-nfs-server[restarted].

    The NFS server also respects → Linux/fhs/etc/hosts_allow and → Linux/fhs/etc/hosts_deny.

  }

}
{ Mounting NFS on the client

code {
sudo mount $NFS_SERVER:/home/rene $MOUNTPOINT
code }

}
{ Showing the export list

code {
showmount -e
code }

On the client:
code {
showmount -e $NFS_SERVER
code }


}
{ Restarting the server #restart-nfs-server

code {
sudo → Linux/fhs/etc/init_d/nfs-kernel-server restart
code }

}
{ Advantage

  The *advantage* for the client is that he does not be aware of his using NFS, he can use `open`, `close` etc as
  he does with his local files.

}
{ Limitations #limitations

  There are at least four limitations with NFS:

  1) The total size of the files of an NFS mount is limited to storage capabilities of the server.

  2) No high availability - What happens, if the server goes down?

  3) If there are many clients, there might be performance bottlenecks when they simultaneously try to
  read from or write to the server.

  4) Finally, the client need to transfer the data to their local machine

  → development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS tries to solve these limitations.

  A further perceived limitation might be that → Linux/filesystem/GVfs[GVfs] is not supported.

{ Installation

  { Ubuntu

    → Linux/distributions/Ubuntu distinguishes between a server and a client.

    { Server

code {
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
code }

    }
    { Client

code {
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
code }

    }
  }
  { Arch linux

    → Linux/distributions/arch[Arch] does not have such a distinction, both NFS server and client are installed with
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/distributions/arch/pacman -Sy nfs-utils
code }

  }

}
sa:
  → Linux/fhs/etc/default/nfs-kernel-server
