$ Shrink and grow filesystems and partitions in Linux

These example scripts try to show how filesystems and partitions can be shrunk and grown if a partition has become too little to accomodate for larger files.

We're going to create a few partitions, most of the 10 M in size. The goal will be to grow the third partition to 15 M. In order to be able to that, the fourth
partition needs to be shrank to 5 MB and then moved »to the right«.

{ Variables

  First, we need to define a few variables.

 `device` is the harddisk on which these examples are to be run. If you run the following code, please make sure that you choose a hard disk with no important data on it!

 `exec_parted` is how → Linux/shell/commands/parted is to be executed. It contains a reference to `$device` to make sure that we're not accidentally destroy the data on
 → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[`/dev/sda`].

 `mountdir` specifies the directory where we're going to → Linux/shell/commands/mount[`mount`] the filesystems on.

 Finally, `part_n_start` define, *in bytes*, where a partition starts on `$device`. The last partition also needs `part_7_end`.

{ Removing each partition

  In order to start with the example, we remove each partition on the hard disk.

  I believe this is technically not really necessary, because in the next step we're going to create a partition table anyway. But it shows how to use the `rm` command of `parted`.

}
{ Creating a partition table

  Before we can create the partitions we need to initialise the hard disk with a partition table.
  
  I probably could choose the *partition type* `msdos`, but I go with the more modern `gpt`.

  However, before I create the partition table, I *really* (and possibly paranoidly) want to erase evertything that reminds me of the past of the hard disk.
  -
  So, I use → Linux/shell/commands/dd[`dd`] to erase the start (and thus the old partition table) of the hard disk.

}
{ Creating the partition

  With `gparted`'s `mkpart` command I can create on partition after another.

  I use the previously declared variables to specify the start and the end for each partition.
  -
  Note also the `b` after each start and end number. It signifies that the numbers are to be interpreted in bytes.

}
{ Printing the partition table

  Now that the partition table has been created, I want to print it. This is also possible with `gparted`.

}
{ Formatting and mounting the partitions

  We're now ready to mount and format (command `mkfs.ext4`) the new partitions.

}
{ Creating some files

  We're going to create some files.

  Note especially partition 4 (`/dev/${device}4`) where I create two 4M files.   

  After creating those huge files, I create a rather smallisch `readme.txt` file. This file is placed at the »end« of the file system (because the
  two 4M files occupy most of the file system.

  Then I drop one of the 4M files to make room when we're going to shrink this filesystem

}
{ Unmount partitions

  Going into »administration mode«. We unmount the partitions so that we're able to shrink and/or grow them.

}
{ Shrinking filesystem on partition 4

  Before we can grow partition 3, we need to make room for it. So we shrink partition 4 to 5 MB.

  Yet, before we can shrink the partition we need to shrink the filesystem.

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/shrink-filesystem||

}
{ Creating a file system image

  The fileystem in partition 4 is now 5 M in size. We store it away so that we can
  restore it again when the partition is shrunk.

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/create-filesystem-image||

}
{ Moving partition 4

  The fourth partition is not actually shrunk in one step: it is first deleted entierly (`rm`) and
  then recreated with a different start and the same end as it previously had.

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/shrink-partition||

}
{ Restoring the filesystem image

  Again with `dd`, the file system image we created is restored into the moved partition;

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/restore-filesystem-image||

}
{ Grow partition 3

  After moving the fourth partition up, we have enough room for the third partition go grow.

  Again, we first delete it entirely and resize it.

  Note: removing the partition does no harm to the filesystem that is stored in it. Since the
  filesystem will physically reside in the same place on the harddisk after recreating the partition, there is no need
  to take an image file.

}
{ Grow filesystem

  The partition is now 15 M, but the filesystem is still 10 M. So, we have to grow it as well.

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/grow-filesystem||

}
{ Mounting again

  After we have finished the shrinking and growing, we can mount the filesystems again:

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/mount-again||

}
{ Writing a large file

  Since the third partition is now 15 M, we can write a file up to ca 12 M (some space is needed
  by the filesystem itself which we cannot access).

  gh|about-filesystems-and-partitions|/shrink-and-grow/write-large-file||

}
{ Showing the files and contents

  Let's check if the files are still valid and intact and if the 12 M file is indeed that size.

}
{ Unmounting again

  In order to release the hard disk, we're unmounting the harddisk again.
