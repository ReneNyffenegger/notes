A *RAID device* is a *virtual device* that is created from at least two → Linux/devices/index#block-devices[block devices].

RAID is an abbreviation for *redundant array of inexpensive* (or also *independent*) *disks* which highlights the difference to *SLED* (single large expensive disk).

{ RAID levels

  The *RAID level* specifies how data is distributed accross the disks to achieve one of the following goals:
    • reliability,
    • availability,
    • performance and/or
    • capacity.

  RAID levels greater than 0 protect against
    • unrecoverable sector read errors or
    • failures of whole physical drives.

  table { rlll
   ~Level~ ☰ ☰ ~Read | Write performance~ ☰ ~Lost capacity~
    0 ☰ Blocks are striped accross the disks. This leads to better read and write performance but causes the entire array to fail if only one disk gets corrupted. ☰ | NX ☰ None
    1 ☰ Data is identically stored («mirrored») on multiple drives. ☰ ☰ 50 %
    2 ☰ Bit-level striping with dedicated Hamming-code parity. Not commonly used (if at all) ☰ ☰
    3 ☰ Byte-level striping with decicated parity. Not commonly used. ☰ ☰
    4 ☰ Block-level striping with dedicated parity ☰  ☰
    5 ☰ Block-level striping with distributed parity. The failure of one disk can be tolerated. Requires at least three disks. Generally, RAID 5 is not recommended because a) of its write penalty when managing parity data and b) if a disk fails while an already failed disk is repaired, the whole array becomes useless. ☰ ☰ 1 disk
    6 ☰ Block-level striping with double distributed parity. ☰ ☰ 2 disks
   10 ☰ Aka RAID 1+0 (i. e. A RAID 0 stripe of mirror sets). Allegedly the more optimal compared to RAID 1 if four drives are available. ☰  ☰ 50 %

? Linux supports software RAID devices through the *md* (multiple devices) device driver.

  TODO: What's the difference between RAID 1 and RAID 10?
