  A file's or directory's access right bits can be changed with → Linux/shell/commands/chmod.

  { Sticky bit #sticky-bit

    `→ Linux/shell/commands/chmod a+t some_file`

    A directory With the *sticky bit* set that is writeable allows users to write files into it, but these files cannot be deleted or modified except by the user owning them.
