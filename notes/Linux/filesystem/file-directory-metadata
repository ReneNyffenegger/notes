$ File and directory metadata

The file or directory metadata consists of information such as
  • Inode number
  • Access rights/permissions (file mode bits)
  • Size/number of blocks allocated)
  • Time of last access, last modification and last inode change (sometimes referred to as *atime*, *mtime* and *ctime*).
  • Device number
  • ID of file owner and group owner (uid, gid)
  • Time of birth
  • SELinux security context string

Such metadata can be printed with → Linux/shell/commands/stat[`stat`]

{ Access rights/permissions (file mode bits) #file-mode-bits

  A file's or directory's access right bits can be changed with → Linux/shell/commands/chmod.

  { Sticky bit #sticky-bit

    `→ Linux/shell/commands/chmod a+t some_file`

    A directory With the *sticky bit* set that is writeable allows users to write files into it, but these files cannot be deleted or modified except by the user owning them.

    This is particularly useful for the → Linux/fhs/tmp directory.

  }

}
{ atime, mtime, ctime #fs-amt-time

  A file in a typical → Linux/filesystem[Linux filesystem] has three timestampes: atime (last access time), mtime (last modification time) and ctime (last change time).

  The *modification time* is the last time that the data (content) of the file has changed.

  The *change time* is the last time that the attributes of a file have changed. 

  With → Linux/shell/commands/cp[`cp`], the timestamps (also ctime?) can be preserved by using the `--preserve=timestamps` option.

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/touch` can be used to change a file's *atime* and *mtime*, but not the *ctime*.

  A file's atime, mtime and ctime are shown with → Linux/shell/commands/ls#ls-time[one of the `ls -l` variants].
