There are four type of device files (for the corresponding type of devices)
  • → Linux/block-device[block_devices] (such as harddisks)
  • character devices (such as printers)
  • pipe devices
  • socket devices
The type of the device file can be shown by the first character with `→Linux/shell/commands/ls -l`.

Note: network cards don't have an associated device file.

Device files are created with `mknod` (→Linux/shell/commands/mknod). They should be created in the → Linux/fhs/dev/index directory.
