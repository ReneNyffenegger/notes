There are four type of device files (for the corresponding type of devices)
  • → Linux/devices#block-devices[block_devices] (such as harddisks)
  • → Linux/devices#character-devices[character devices] (such as printers)
  • pipe devices
  • socket devices
The type of the device file can be shown by the first character with ` →Linux/shell/commands/ls → Linux/shell/commands/ls/l[-l]`.

Network cards don't have an associated device file.

Device files are created with `→ Linux/shell/commands/mknod`. They should be created in the `→ Linux/fhs/dev` directory.

sa:

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/devices_txt`
