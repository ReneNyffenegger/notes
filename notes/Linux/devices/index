{ Block devices #block-devices

  Data is accessed in chunks of a fixed size.
  
  { Identifying block devices
  
    Block devices can be found like so
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/lsblk
code }
or
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/find → Linux/fhs/dev -b
code }
or
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/ls → Linux/fhs/sys/block
code }

   `→ Linux/shell/commands/ls -l` prints a leading `b` for block devices.
  
  }
  { Disk partitions

    Some (all?) block devices can be divided into one or more logical disks called → hardware/harddisk/partition[partitions].

  }
  { See also

    `→ Linux/fhs/sys/block` contains information about block devices.
    -
    The shell command `blockdev`

  }
}
{ Character devices #character-devices

    `→ Linux/shell/commands/ls -l` prints a leading `c` for character devices.

  TOOD: → Linux/TTY

}
{ Device drivers / major and minor numbers

  The correct device driver for a device is identified by the → Linux/kernel by the major number of the device driver.

  The minor number is used by the device driver itself. The meaning changes from driver to driver.
