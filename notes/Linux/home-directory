In →Linux/shell/bash (and other → Linux/shell/index[shells] too?), the home directory can be abbreviated with the tilde (`~`).
Another → Linux/user[user's] home directory can be abbreviated with `~fred` (assuming the login name for the other user is *fred*).

The → development/environment-variable#home also points to the home directory.

In unix, the home directory for a user is stored in → Linux/fhs/etc/passwd.
