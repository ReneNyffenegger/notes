$ Linux terminal subsystem

The terminal subsystem consists of three layers
  • The upper layer implements the → Linux/devices#character-devices[character device] interface (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close` …)
  • The line discipline
  • The lower layer which communicates with the hardware or the → development/misc/pseudo-terminal.

The line discipline glues the upper and the lower layer together.

The tty subsystem is *passive*: it only reacts on either a key being pressed or the user requesting something from it.
