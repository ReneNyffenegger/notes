Almost all daemons are spawned by → Linux/init.

{ Examples for daemons

  → Linux/syslogd, → Linux/sshd. 

}

{ Standard behavior

  They
    • have no → Linux/TTY
    • ignore → Linux/kernel/signals except → Linux/kernel/signals#sigterm
    • have no open file descriptors (although → Linux/syslogd violates that rule in that it writes to →development/log-files.
    • are dissassociated from → Linux/kernel/process[process] groups.

}
