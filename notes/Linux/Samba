  Each share is configured through a → Linux/fhs/etc/samba/smb_conf#sections[section in the /etc/samba/smb.conf] file.

}
{ Find Samba servers

  The network can be queried for Samba servers with the `findsmb` command.

}
{ Mounting a samba host

code {
$ sudo mount -t cifs //hostname/share /mnt/some-dir -o user=rene,password=secretGarden
code }

Apparently, it also works with the *NetBios* name:
code {
$ sudo mount -t cifs //NetBIOSname/share /mnt/some-dir -o user=rene,password=secretGarden
code }

If the share is mounted as above, tt seems that the mounted files and directories will belong to the root → Linux/user[user] and → Linux/group which allows to read files but not to
write files or create new ones. Therefore, the *gid* and the *uid* could be expclicitely stated in the mount command as well:
code {
$ sudo mount -t cifs //hostname/share /mnt/some-dir -o user=rene,password=secretGarden,uid=rene,gid=users
code }

}
