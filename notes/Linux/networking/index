$ Linux: networking

`nmcli` is a command-line tool for controlling the *NetworkManager*.

`iwconfig` is similar to `ifconfig`, but dedicated to the wireless interfaces.

`lo` is the → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback#Virtual_loopback_interface[Virtual loopback interface]

`ss` is a tool to investigate network ports.

{ systemd

  { systemd-networkd

   *systemd-networkd* is a system daemon that manages network configurations: it detects and configures network devices as they appear and might create virtual network devices.

    Enabling systemd-networkd.service also enables *systemd-networkd-wait-online.service*, which is a oneshot system service that waits for the network to be configured.
    -
   *systemd-networkd-wait-online.service* has `WantedBy=network-online.target`, so it will be started only when *network-online.target* itself is enabled.
 
    Check if systemd-networkd is → Linux/init/systemd#systemd-unit-state[activated]:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/systemctl is-activated systemd-networkd
code }

  }
  { systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

    By default, *systemd-networkd-wait-online.service* waits for (all/at least one?) network to be configured.

  }
  { systemd-resolved

   *systemd-resolved* is the service that provides network name resolution to local applications via
     • a → Linux/D-Bus interface,
     • the NSS service, and
     • a local DNS stub listener on 127.0.0.53

   *systemd-resolved` is configured in
     • `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`
     • `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d` (drop-in conf files)

  }

}
{ netctl #linux-netctl

 *netctl* is an → Linux/distributions/arch[Arch Linux] related network manager.

  { Profiles

    netctl uses *profiles* to manage networks.

  ? Profiles can be started automatically or on demand, depending on the *mode of operation*.

    Profiles are stored under `→ Linux/fhs/etc/netctl`, example profiles under `/etc/netctl/examples`.

    Profiles can be started on the command line with
code {
netctl start profile-name
code }

    In case the profile cannot be started, use one of the following two commands
code {
journalctl -xn
netctl status profile-name
code }

    In order to start the profile automatically at start up, it needs to be enabled, which creates
    a → Linux/init/systemd service (→ Linux/init/systemd#systemd-unit[unit]?) and → Linux/init/systemd#systemd-unit-endisabled[enables] the unit.

  }
  { Systemd units

    netctl systemd units include
    table { ll
      netctl.service ☰
      netctl@<interface>.service (?) ☰
      netctl-sleep.service ☰ When enabled, active network profiles are stored and stopped before the machine is put to sleep and restared when the system is resumed.
      netctl-auto@<interface>.service ☰ Scans «its» interface and tries to start a profile for the found network.
      netctl-ifplugd@<interface>.service ☰ Starts `ifplugd` on «its» interface
      netctl-wait-online.service ☰ Waits for all enabled netctl profiles to come online (if activated)
    table }

  }
  { wifi-menu

   `wifi-menu` is a tool that interactively connects to a wireless network and/or generate a netctl profile.
