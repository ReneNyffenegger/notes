*udev* (= userspace `→ Linux/fhs/dev/`) is (systemd's) successor of → development/misc/devfs and provides persistent naming for devices.

udev dynamically creates device nodes in the `→ Linux/fhs/dev` directory with consistent naming.

Whenever the Kernel detects a change in the device tree (i. e. when a device is added or removed etc.), a → Linux/kernel/uevent is raised.
This uevent is then probed against the udev rules whose defined actions are triggered when the uevent matches the rule criteria.

When Linux is booted, udev takes an inventory of the hardware and loads the appropriate modules (drivers).


{ Rules

  The rules for udev are formulated in
 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev`, `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev/rules_d`,
 `→ Linux/fhs/lib/udev`, `→ Linux/fhs/lib/udev/rules_d`

 ? and also `/run/udev/rules.d`?

}
{ Hardware Information

  The `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev/hwdb_d` and `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/udev/hwdb_d` directories maintain information about hardware devices.

  Udev turns this information into a binary database: `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev/hwdb_bin`.

}
{ Eudev

  *Eudev* is an alternative to udev that is apparently independent from → Linux/init/systemd (or any other → Linux/distributions[distribution] or init system).
