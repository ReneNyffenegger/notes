*udev* = userspace → Linux/fhs/dev/. Successor of → development/misc/devfs.

It manages
  • dynamic creation of device nodes in → Linux/fhs/dev/index[/dev] directory.
  • user space events raised while hardware devices are added to or removed from a Linux system.

When Linux is booted, udev takes an inventory of the hardware and loads the appropriate modules (drivers).

udev replaces the basic functionality of → development/misc/devfs, while allowing persistent device naming for devices.

{ Hardware Information

  The → Linux/fhs/etc/udev/hwdb_d and → Linux/fhs/usr/lib/udev/hwdb_d directories maintain information about hardware devices.

  Udev turns this information into a binary database: → Linux/fhs/etc/udev/hwdb_bin.

  Apparently, this database is updated with

{ Eudev

  *Eudev* is an alternative to udev that is apparently independent from → Linux/init/systemd (or any other → Linux/distributions[distribution] or init system).
