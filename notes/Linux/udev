Successor of → development/misc/devfs.

It manages
  • device nodes in → Linux/fhs/dev/index[/dev] directory.
  • user space events raised while hardware devices are added to or removed from a Linux system.

When Linux is booted, udev takes an inventory of the hardware and loads the appropriate modules (drivers).

udev replaces the basic functionality of → development/misc/devfs, while allowing persistent device naming for devices.
