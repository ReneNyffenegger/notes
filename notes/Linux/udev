*udev* = userspace → Linux/fhs/dev/. Successor of → development/misc/devfs.

udev manages
  • dynamic creation of device nodes in → Linux/fhs/dev/index[/dev] directory.
  • user space events raised while hardware devices are added to or removed from a Linux system.

When Linux is booted, udev takes an inventory of the hardware and loads the appropriate modules (drivers).

udev replaces the basic functionality of → development/misc/devfs, while allowing persistent device naming for devices.

{ Hardware Information

  The `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev/hwdb_d` and `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/udev/hwdb_d` directories maintain information about hardware devices.

  Udev turns this information into a binary database: `→ Linux/fhs/etc/udev/hwdb_bin`.

}
{ Eudev

  *Eudev* is an alternative to udev that is apparently independent from → Linux/init/systemd (or any other → Linux/distributions[distribution] or init system).

}
