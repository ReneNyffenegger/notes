code {
$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/man
man-db-2.6.7.1-16.fc21.x86_64
code }

Find package's upstream URL:
code {
$ rpm -qi man-db | grep -i url
URL         : http://www.nongnu.org/man-db/
code }

Apparently, the Debian equivalents are
code {
$ dpkg -S /usr/bin/man
$ apt-cache show man-db | grep Homepage
code }
