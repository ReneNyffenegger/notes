abbr: Common Unix Printing System

CUPS is based on  → Linux/IPP[IPP], the Internet Printing Protocol and uses → development/languages/PostScript/PPD[PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files]
to describe the capabilites of printers.

{ Starting CUPS

  CUPS is started with `cupsd` (the cups scheduler), see `man cupsd`.

}
{ Configuration

  `→ Linux/fhs/etc/cups/cupsd_conf` is the main(?) configuration file for CUPS.

}
{ Printer drivers

 
  → Linux/shell/commands/lpinfo[`lpinfo -m`] lists all available driver.

}
{ Shell commands


 `→ Linux/shell/commands/lpadmin` configures CUPS printers and classes. For example, a printer might be added with
code {
printer_name=ep901a
device_uri=usb:/EPSON/EP-901A
ppd_file=/opt/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr/ppds/EPSON/EPSON-EP-901A-epson-escpr-en.ppd.gz
lpadmin -p $printer -v $device_uri - P $ppds -E
code }

  → Linux/shell/commands/lpinfo[`lpinfo`] lists available devices and drivers that are known to the CUPS server.

  `lp` and `lpr` can be used to print files:
code {
lp  -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi $file
lpr -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi $file
code }

}
{ Monitoring

  CUPS can be accessed via → http://localhost:631/admin. 631 is the default port for the → Linux/IPP[Internet Printing Protocol].

  The user accessing CUPS must be member of the `lpadmin` → Linux/group. (Otherwise, the webinterface might complain with
  *Enter your username and → development/security/password[password] or the root username and password to access this page. If you are using Kerberos → development/security/authentication[authentication], make sure you have a valid Kerberos ticket.*)

}
{ Filters

  ? Filters are used to render → development/languages/PostScript onto a pixel based device. These are necessary for printers that don't have built in post script support.

  CUPS provides such filters: *gstoraster* (→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/cups/filter/gstoraster) and *imagetoraster* (→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/cups/filter/imagetoraster). These are based on the filter system of ghostscript.

}
{ Queues and Jobs

    A queue is »attached« to a printer. It keeps track of the status of the printer (Enough paper? Printer Jam? Toner reserver? etc).

    A job is created when an application asks something to be printed. The job is placed into a queue and removed when the printing is finished.

}
{ Job Sequence

    The application sends → development/languages/PostScript data to CUPS.
    
    CUPS reads the destination printer's respective
    → development/languages/PostScript/PPD[PostScript Printer Description (PPD) File] to determine the necessary filters to convert the PostScript into
    the format the printer understands (such as PJL, PCL).
    -
    Usually, this is handed over to GhostScript.

    The converted data is sent to the printers

}
{ Restarting cups

code {
# → Linux/fhs/etc/init_d/[/etc/init.d]/cups restart
code }

{ Installing Epson ET-4800

  I somehow managed to install and configure Epson ET-4800 like so:
    • Found the module (driver?) on → https://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/searchModule[Epson's module search page].
    • Downloaded *Epson Inkjet Printer Driver (ESC/P-R) for Linux*
    • Extracted the downloaded .deb file: `sudo dpkg -i epson-injket-printer-escpr-amd64.deb`
    • Installed CUPS: `sudo apt -y install cups` and `sudo apt -y install cups-pdf`
    • Executed `sudo lpadmin -p ET-4800-tq84 -v socket://192.168.0.45/ -P /opt/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr/ppds/Epson/Epson-ET-4800_Series-epson-inkjet-printer-escpr.ppd.gz -E` (`192.168.0.45` is the address DHCP assigned to the printer).

  When trying to print, I got *Stopped, Filter failure* error message.

  In the log file `→ Linux/fhs/var/log/cups/error_log`, I found *ET-4800-tq84: error while loading shared libraries: libcupsimage.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory*.
  -
  I also got the same error message by trying to manually execute `/opt/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr/cups/lib/filter/epson-escpr-wrapper`.

  I am not sure anymore if I changed the log level from `warn` to `debug` in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/cups/cupsd_conf` order to see this helpful error message. Anyway, I then installed the missing library as well: `sudo apt -y install libcupsimage2`.

  For example, it has the → http://www.openprinting.org/printers[printer database] which allows to search for
  a driver for a specific printer/manafacturer.
