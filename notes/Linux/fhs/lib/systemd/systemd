`/usr/lib/systemd/systemd` is likely the most important → Linux/init/systemd#systemd-binaries[systemd binary].

{ Started as first process vs. subsequent starts

  { First process

    In a → Linux/init/systemd environment, `systemd` is started as first process and hence has PID 1.

    This process then brings up and maintains userspace services.


  }
  { Additional processes

    Besides the `systemd` process with PID 1, additional `systemd` processes can be (or are?) started for users that are logging into the system.

    If these additional processes are started via a (symlinked) `init` name, it will execute `telinit` (for compatiblity with SysV) and pass the command line arguments. 

  }

{ /sbin/init

  Typically, `→ Linux/fhs/sbin/init` is a symlink to `/lib/systemd/systemd`:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/readlink -f /sbin/init
/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
code }

}

{ TODO

  The user manager instances are started automatically through the `user@.service(5)` service.

  `man 8 telinit`

code {
$ → Linux/init/systemd/tools/systemctl → Linux/init/systemd/tools/systemctl/show nginx -p FragmentPath
FragmentPath=/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
code }


}
