$ /lib/modules/$(uname -r)

{ Debian

  At least Debian seems to install kernel modules not directly under `→ Linux/fhs/lib/modules` but in a «versioned» sub-directory named after the result of `→ Linux/shell/commands/uname -r`.

  The Debian/APT package `linux-image-$(uname -r)` contains some of the files located in this directory.
  -
  Compare with the APT package `linux-headers-$(uname -r)`.

sa:
 `→ Linux/fhs/usr/src/linux-headers-uname-r`
