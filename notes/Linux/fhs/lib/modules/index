$ /lib/modules

This directory contains directories with → Linux/kernel/module[kernel modules] needed for the → Linux/kernel/index.

These directories are created after → Linux/kernel/compilation[building the kernel] with `make modules_install`. 

The name of these directories follows the pattern kernel-version-→Linux/kernel/CONFIG/LOCALVERSION (apparently, that
is equal to → Linux/fhs/lib/modules/VERSION/.
