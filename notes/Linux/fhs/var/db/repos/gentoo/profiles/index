$ /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles

`/var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles` contains profiles that are controlled by the developers of the Gentoo ebuild repository (gentoo.git).

One of them needs to be selected as the system profile. To override these settings, use the files in the `/etc/portage/profile/` directory.
