$ /var/run/sudo/ts

`/var/run/sudo/ts` is the default directory where `â†’ Linux/shell/commands/sudo` stores timestamp files (which are used to determine if a user has to re-enter a password when executing a command with `sudo`).

sa:
  `sudo -k` invalidates a timestamp file, `sudo -K` removes it and `sudo -v` updates it without running a command.
