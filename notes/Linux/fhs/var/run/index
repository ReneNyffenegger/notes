$ /var/run

This directory contains run-time variable files, like files holding process identifiers (PIDs) and logged user information (utmp).

Files in this directory are usually cleared when the system boots.

The → Linux/distributions/Debian#debian-policy-manual requires `/var/run` to be a symbolic link to `→ Linux/fhs/run` (→ https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s-fhs[section 9.1.1]).
