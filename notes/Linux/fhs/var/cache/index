$ /var/cache

The subdirectories of `/var/cache` are intended to store *cached information*.

Because `/var/cache` is generally not world writeable, → Linux/X/XDG recommends that applications store cached data in a location below the directorry pointed at by the environment variable `→ development/environment-variable#xdg_cache_home` (or `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_cache` if the variable is not set).
