$ /var/lib/portage/world

`/var/lib/portage/world` contains the list of packages that were explicitly installed by a system administrator.

Before installing `app-editors/vim`, the package is not found in the world file:
code {
# grep vim /var/lib/portage/world
code }

After installing this package, it is recorded in the world file:
code {
# emerge --ask app-editors/vim
…
# grep vim /var/lib/portage/world
app-editors/vim
code }

sa:

  Using the `--oneshot` argument of `→ Linux/package-managers/Portage/commands/emerge` avoids adding a package to the world file.
