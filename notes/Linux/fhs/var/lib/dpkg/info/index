{ File suffixes/extensions

  I've found the following file → development/filename-extensions[file extensions/suffixes] in `/var/lib/dpkg/info`:
  table { ll
    `conffiles` ☰ List (ASCII files) of the configuration files that ship with a package
    `config` ☰ Perl or shell scripts 
    `/format` ☰
    `list` ☰ List of directories and files of a package(?)
    `md5sums` ☰ Hash of files found in `*.list`?
    `postinst` ☰ Shell scripts
    `postrm` ☰ Shell scripts
    `preinst` ☰ Shell scripts
    `prerm` ☰ Shell scripts
    `shlibs` ☰
    `symbols` ☰
    `templates` ☰ Translation of messages?
    `triggers` ☰
  table }

  These suffixes were found with the following command:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/find -type f | → development/languages/sed -n 's/.*\.\(.*\)/\1/p' | → Linux/shell/commands/sort | → Linux/shell/commands/uniq -c
code }

}
