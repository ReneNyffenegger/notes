$ /var/lock

This directory contains (device-) lock files.

The naming convention is `LCK..<device>` where `<device>` is the name of the device in the filesystem.

The format of the files' content is that of *HDU UUCP* lock files: PID as a 10 byte ASCII decimal number, followed by a newline character.
