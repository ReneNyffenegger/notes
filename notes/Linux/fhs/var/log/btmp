$ /var/log/btmp
-

The  wtmp  file records all logins and logouts.

{ Format

  Its format is exactly like → Linux/fhs/var/log/utmp[utmp] except that a null username indicates a logout on the associated terminal

  `file` interestingly reports it to be a *dBase III* file:
  code {
  $ → Linux/shell/commands/file /var/log/btmp
  btmp: dBase III DBT, version number 0, next free block index 6
  code }

}

sa:
  → Linux/fhs/var/log
