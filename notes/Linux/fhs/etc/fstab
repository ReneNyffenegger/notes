$ /etc/fstab

`/etc/fstab` is the → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[filesystem] table.

Each (uncommented) line has the following fields:
  • File system (`/dev/…` or `UUID=…`)
  • Mount point (can be `none`, for example for swap partitions)
  • Type of file system (ext4, swap etc.)
  • Options
  • Dump
  • Pass

code {
/dev/sda5  none  swap  sw                        0 0
/dev/sda6  /     ext4  rw,relatime,data=ordered  0 1
/dev/sda7  /var  ext4  rw,relatime,data=ordered  0 2     
code }

{ Mounting all mentioned filesystems

 `mount -a` mounts all filesystems mentioned in `/etc/fstab`.
code {
mount -a [-t fs-type] [-O optlist]
code }

  This command is usually used in a boot-script.

  It's possible to combine `mount -a` with `-F` to make `mount` fork so that filesystems are mounted in parallel.

 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/mtab`, `→ Linux/fhs/proc/mount`

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/mount`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/findmnt`

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/swapon`

 `genfstab` helps to create an initial `/etc/fstab` file when a system is installed.
