$ /etc/default/keyboard

The *→ hardware/keyboard configuration file*. It describes the properties of the keyboard.

Sample configuration file:

XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT=""
XKBOPTIONS=""

BACKSPACE="guess"
code }

`XKBMODEL` specifies the keyboard model name. Default is `pc105`. See → Linux/fhs/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg_lst

Apparently, this file is not present in an → Linux/distributions/arch[Arch distribution].
