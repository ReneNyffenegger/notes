$ /etc/apt/sources.list

`sources.list` specifies the locations which are used to resynchronize the *package index files* with `→ Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt-get update`,
i. e. it contains the locations of → Linux/package-managers/APT#apt-repositories[apt repositories] to fetch packages from.

{ Format

  There are two formats for `/etc/apt/sources.list` and → Linux/fhs/etc/apt/sources_list_d[`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`]:
    • One-line format
    • Deb822 format

  { One-line format #apt-esl-one-line

    Each line defines *one* data source and contains at least 4 fields:
      • Package format: The package format is either `deb` (binary package) or `deb-src` (source package)
      • Root URL of the archive
      • Distribution name (either the suite name (`stable`, `testing` …)  or code name `bullseye`, `bookworm` …)
      • The 4th and remaining fields is a list of valid archive → Linux/distributions/Debian#deb-arch-area[area names] in the archive
  
    Thus, the *one-line* format for `sources.list` looks like
code {
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main
code }

    The → development/filename-extensions[extentsion] for files in this format must be → development/filename-extensions#list[`.list`].

  }
  { Deb822 format #apt-esl-deb822

    In the Deb822 format, data sources are specified in blocks which are separated by a blank line. The first line of the one-line format above would be represented in the following four lines in the Deb822 format:
code {
Types: deb
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian
Suites: bullseye
Components: main
code }

    The `#` character at the start of a line comments it out.
    -
    An entire entry can be disable by adding adding `Enabled: no`.
   
    The → development/filename-extensions[extentsion] for files in this format must be → development/filename-extensions#sources[`.sources`].
    -
    Additionally, only the following characters are allowed in the filename:
      • Letters (`a` - `z`, `A` - `Z`)
      • Digits (`0` - `9`)
      • Period (`.`)
      • Underscore (`_`)
      • Hyphen (`-`)

    More information is in the → https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/dpkg-dev/deb822.5.en.html[deb822 man page].

{ Editing /etc/apt/sources.list

  In order to add or remove repostiories, `/etc/apt/sources.list` or files in the directory `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` need to be edited.

  { apt edit-sources

    `→ Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt edit-sources` edits `/etc/apt/sources.list` in the preferred → development/editors[editor].

  }
  { APT package software-properties-common

     The apt package software-properties-common installs Python scripts for adding and removing PPAs: 
code {
$  → Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt-file#apt-file-show[apt-file show] software-properties-common | → Linux/shell/commands/grep → Linux/shell/commands/grep#grep-P[-P] → Linux/shell/commands/grep#grep-o[-o] '\S+/bin/\S+'
→ Linux/APT/commands/add-apt-repository[/usr/bin/add-apt-repository]
/usr/bin/apt-add-repository
code }

     These scripts can be installed with
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
code }

  }
}
  
sa:


  The `→ Linux/fhs/etc/apt` directory

 `→ Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt upgrade`

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/man 5 sources.list`

 `→ Linux/fhs/var/lib/apt/lists` is the *storage area for state information for each package resource specified in `sources.list`*

code {
→ Linux/package-managers/APT/commands/apt-config dump | grep Dir::Etc::source
code }
