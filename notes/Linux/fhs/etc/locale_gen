$ /etc/locale.gen

`/etc/locale.gen` contains local settings and system languages.
-
Every line that does not begin with a `#` is treated as a locale definition to be built by the shell script `/usr/bin/locale-gen`. This script reads `locale.gen` and invokes
`→ Linux/shell/commands/localedef`  for the chosen localisation profiles.

sa:
  → Linux/locale
