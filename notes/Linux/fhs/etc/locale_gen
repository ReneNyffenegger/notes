$ /etc/locale.gen

`/etc/locale.gen` contains the → Linux/locale definitions and system languages.
-
Every line that does not begin with a `#` is treated as a locale definition to be built by the shell script `/usr/bin/locale-gen`. This script reads `locale.gen` and invokes
`→ Linux/shell/commands/localedef` for the chosen localisation profiles and places the generated locales in `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/locale`.

The format of uncommented lines in the file is `<locale-name> <charset>`, for example
code {
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
de_CH.UTF-8 UTF-8
code }
