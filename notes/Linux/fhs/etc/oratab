$ /etc/oratab

This file is used by Oracle.

It is created by `root.sh` and updated by the
  • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/Database-Configuration-Assistant[Database Configuration Assistant] (when a database is created) or
  • ASM configuration assistant (when an ASM instance is created).

Each non empty line in this file is an entry.

Lines can be commented with `#`.

An entry consists of three parts that are separated by a colon (`:`)

The first part is the Oracle SID. The second part is the path to the → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n[Oracle Home directory]. The third part is either an `N` or a `Y` to indicate
if the respective database should be started when the system is booted.
