$ /etc/oratab

The `/etc/oratab` file is a registry of installed databases and Oracle homes on a machine. The main purpose of this file is to automate
  • setting environment variables
  • starting and stopping Oracle databases (instances)

The file is created by `root.sh` and updated by the
  • → development/databases/Oracle/tools/Database-Configuration-Assistant[Database Configuration Assistant] (when a database is created) or
  • ASM configuration assistant (when an ASM instance is created).

Each non empty line in this file is an entry.

Lines can be commented with `#`.

An entry consists of three parts that are separated by a colon (`:`)
  • The first part is the Oracle SID.
  • The second part is the path to the → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n[Oracle Home directory].
  • The third part is either an `N` or a `Y` to indicate if the respective database should be started when the system is booted.
