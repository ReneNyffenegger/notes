$ /etc/syslog.conf
-

The `syslog.conf` file is the main configuration file for → Linux/syslogd. It allows to specify rules that control the behavior of logging.

A *rule* consists of a *selector* and an *action*, seperated by whitespace.

A *selector* consists of a *facility* and a *priority*, seperated by a `.`.

{ Facilities

  Facility is one of the following keywords:
    • auth
    • authpriv
    • cron
    • daemon
    • ftp
    • kern (to be used by the → Linux/kernel[kernel])
    • lpr
    • mail
    • mark
    • news
    • security (should not be used, use the equivalent to auth)
    • syslog
    • user
    • uucp
    • local0-7

  
}
{ Priorities 

  Priority is one of the following keywords:
    • debug
    • info
    • notice
    • warning (or the equivalent *warn* which is deprecated)
    • err (or the equivalent *error* which is deprecated)
    • crit
    • alert
    • emerg (or the equivalent *panic* which is deprecated)

}  
{ *  , ; = 

  A `*` can be used for *all* facilities or priorities.

  A `,` seperates different facilities or priorities from one another.

  Multiple selectors might be concatenated with `;` for the same action.

  An priority that is preceeded by a `=` indicates to mean *exactly and only* this priority.
