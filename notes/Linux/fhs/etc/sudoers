$ /etc/sudoers

The *sudoers* file. It specifies who can run what with → Linux/shell/commands/sudo.

The file has two types of entries:
  • aliases (sort of variables)
  • user specifications (who may run what)

This file should be edited with `→ Linux/shell/commands/visudo` because `visudo` checks for parsing errors and provides a basic syntax check.

{ Allow a named user to use sudo

  Allow a specifically named user (here: *fred*) to use sudo:
code {
fred ALL=(ALL) ALL
code }

}
{ Allow users in sudo group #allow-sudo-group

  Allow all → Linux/user[users] that are in the `sudo` → Linux/group to use sudo:
code {
%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
code }

  In order to → Linux/shell/commands/useradd#add-user-to-group[add a user to the sudo group], use
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/usermod -a -G sudo fred
code }

}
{ Don't always ask for the password

code {
rene ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
code }

}
{ Using aliases

code {
User_Alias  ADMIN = jane
ADMIN ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
code }

}
{ umask

  Apparently, sudo uses the → Linux/shell/commands/umask in effect when a sudo command is executed.

  With `Defaults umask_override` and `umask`, the umsask can be changed for the command that is executed with sudo.


code {
Defaults umask_override
Defaults umask=0022
code }

}
