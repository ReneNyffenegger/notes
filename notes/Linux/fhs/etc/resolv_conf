$ /etc/resolv.conf

`/etc/resolv.conf` is the resolver configuration file. It's used to access the → development/networking/DNS[DNS] (domain name service).

The following simple example content specifies the nameserver to be 8.8.8.8:
code {
nameserver 8.8.8.8
code }

? At least in → Linux/distributions/Ubuntu, /etc/resolv.conf is not used anymore, unless its »manually« implemented.

In → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux[WSL], `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symbolic link to a file with the same name under → Linux/fhs/mnt/wsl[`/mnt/wsl`].

sa:
  The shell command `→ Linux/shell/commands/host`
