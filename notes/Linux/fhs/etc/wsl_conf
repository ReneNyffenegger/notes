Changing the file apparently requires to restart the subsystem:
code {
C:> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/wsl_exe[wsl] --shutdown
code }

{ Example

code {
# Automatically mount Windows drive when the distribution is launched
[automount]

# Set to true will automount fixed drives (C:/ or D:/) with DrvFs under the root directory set above.
# Set to false means drives won't be mounted automatically, but need to be mounted manually or with fstab.
enabled = true

# Sets the directory where fixed drives will be automatically mounted.
# Using the slash as mounts C:\ to /c, rather than the default /mnt/c. 
root = /

# DrvFs-specific options can be specified.  
options = "metadata,uid=1003,gid=1003,umask=077,fmask=11,case=off"

# Process → Linux/fhs/etc/fstab when a WSL distribution is launched.
mountFsTab = true

[network]
# Network host settings that enable the DNS server used by WSL 2.

# Specify hostname
hostname = DemoHost

# Setting generateHosts to false prevents WSL from the default behavior of auto-generating → Linux/fhs/etc/hosts
generateHosts = false

# Setting generateResolvConf to false prevents WSL from auto-generating → Linux/fhs/etc/resolv_conf, so that you can create your own nameserver (ie. nameserver 1.1.1.1).
generateResolvConf = false

[interop]

# Block launching Windows processing:
enabled = false

# Do not add %PATH%:
appendWindowsPath = false

# Set the user when launching a distribution with WSL.
[user]
default = DemoUser

[boot]
systemd=truej
# Set a command to run when a new WSL instance launches.
command = service docker start
code }
