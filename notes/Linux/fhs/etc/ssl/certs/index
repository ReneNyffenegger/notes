$ /etc/ssl/certs

For systems that use *OpenSSL*, `/etc/ssl/certs` seems to be the standard location for → development/security/cryptography/SSL-TLS[SSL] certificates.

This directory contains symbolic links to `*.pem` and `*.crt` files in `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/ca-certificates`.
-
In addition, there is also `ca-certificates.crt` which is a *single-file* version that holds all CA certificates that are activated in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/ca-certificates_conf`.

sa:
 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/ca-certificates_conf` controls which certificates will or won't be installed to `/etc/ssl/certs` when `→ Linux/shell/commands/update-ca-certificates` is executed.


 `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share`
