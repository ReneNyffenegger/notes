By default, the → development/dynamic-loader searches through →Linux/fhs/lib/index and →Linux/fhs/usr/lib/index for dynamic libraries that are needed by programs.
-
`/etc/ld.so.conf` can be used to configure the dynamic loader to search for other directories (such as →Linux/fhs/usr/local/lib/index or →Linux/fhs/opt/lib/index) as well.
