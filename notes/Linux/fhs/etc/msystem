$ /etc/msystem

I have found `/etc/msystem` in an MSYS2 environment.

As per comments in this file, it is used to provide common information associated with the current *MSYSTEM*, such as
  • compiler architecture
  • host type

`/etc/msystem` sources one of the files found in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/msystem_d`, depending on the value of `$MSYSTEM`.
