$ /etc/oraInst.loc

The `oraInst.loc` file is created by the Oracle Universal Installer when Oracle Software is installed for the first time.

Usually (always?), the `oraInst.loc` file should be placed under → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oraInventory (→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oraInventory/oraInst_loc).

This file is used (by the Oracle Universal Installer) to
  • identify the name of the Oracle Inventory group (by default: `oinstall`)
  • locate the *oraInventory directory*.
