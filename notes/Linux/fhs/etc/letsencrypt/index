Directories:
table { ll
  `accounts/` ☰
  `archive/` ☰
  `csr/` ☰
  `keys/` ☰
  `live/` ☰ For each domain, this directory contains a subdirectory (`→ Linux/fhs/etc/letsencrypt/_domain`) with the keys and certificates for `$DOMAIN`. These files are automatically updated (renewed). The files are (sometimes or always?) symlinks to `/etc/letsencrypt/archive/$DOMAIN`. see also → https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates[Where are my certificates] in the Certbot User Guide.
  `renewal/` ☰ For each managed domain, this directory contains a `$DOMAIN.conf` file which stores the paths to the domain's keys and certificates (`→ Linux/fhs/etc/letsencrypt/_domain`), the archive dir `/etc/letsencrypt/archive/$DOMAIN` and the options used for the renewal process.
  `renewal-hooks/` ☰ Three subdirectories: `pre`, `deploy` and `post`. See also `certbot` options such as `--deploy-hook` etc. See → https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#pre-and-post-validation-hooks[Pre and Post Validation Hooks] in the manual.
