$ /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

`→ Linux/fhs/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc[/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc]/register` can be used to register a *handler application* to be invoked when a file with a given magic number or a given extension
is executed.

{ Registering a handler for an extension

  The following example demonstrates how a handler can be registered for files with the extension `.tq84`.

  The (shell) script (i.e. the handler) which will be invoked. 
code {
echo '#!/bin/bash
echo "tq84 handler was called"
echo "argument/script is $1"' > tq84-handler
code }

  The handler must be executable:
code {
chmod 755 tq84-handler
code }

  Root privileges are required for the registration:
code {
sudo sh
code }

  Definition of some variables, mostly for better legibility:
code {
regName=tq84reg
regType=E         # E = extension
extension=tq84
interpreter=/home/rene/tq84-handler
code }
 
  Finally: the registration:
code {
echo ":$regName:$regType::$extension::$interpreter:" > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
code }

  Root privileges are not required anymore.
code {
exit
code }

  Creating an (empty) file to test the registration:
code {
touch     test.tq84
chmod 755 test.tq84
code }

  Executing the script:
code {
./test.tq84
code }

  Unregistering the handler …
code {
sudo sh
echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/tq84reg
exit
code }

 … and cleaning up:
code {
rm test.tq84 tq84-handler
code }

}
