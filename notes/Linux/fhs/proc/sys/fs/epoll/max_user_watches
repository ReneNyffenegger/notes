$ /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches

`proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches` specifies the (or a?) limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all *epoll instances* on the system.

This limit is per real user ID.

The default value is 4% of the available low memory, divceded by the registration cost in bytes.

Each registered file descriptor occupies roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel.
