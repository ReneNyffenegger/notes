$ /proc

`/proc` is the mount point onto which the → Linux/filesystem/filesystems#proc[proc filesystem] is usually mounted.
-
The original purpose of this file system is to provide information about → Linux/kernel/process[processes] (compare with the debugfs file system `→ Linux/fhs/sys/kernel/debug` and the sysfs file system under `→ Linux/fhs/proc/sys`).
-
However, there are also files that are not about processes, such as `→ Linux/fhs/proc/meminfo`.
-
The information about the process with the PID `$pid` is found under `→ Linux/fhs/proc/pid`.

Special files permit to change the system's current configuration.

  The `/proc` file system is documented in the → Linux/kernel/source[Linux kernel sources] under `→ Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/filesystems/proc_rst`.

  The → Linux/kernel/source[kernel source] directory `→ Linux/kernel/source/fs/proc`.

  A file in the `/proc` file system can be created with the function `proc_create()`, a directory with `proc_mkdir` (both found in `→ Linux/kernel/source/fs/proc/generic_c`)

  The (apt packages) *procps* and *psmisc* have utilities related to the proc filesystem:
    `→ Linux/shell/commands/free`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/kill`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/pgrep`, `pidwait`, `pkill`, `pmap`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/ps`, `pwdx`, `skill`, `slabtop`, `snice`, `tload`, `top`, `uptime`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/vmstat`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/w`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/watch`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/sysctl`,
    `→ Linux/shell/commands/fuser`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/killall`, `peekfd`, `pslog`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/pstree`, `pstree.x11`.

  `→ Linux/shell/commands/acpi` shows battery and thermal information found in the `/proc` filesystem.
