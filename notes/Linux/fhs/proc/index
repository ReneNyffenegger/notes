$ /proc

`/proc` is the mount point onto which the → Linux/filesystem/filesystems#proc[proc filesystem] is usually mounted.
-
This file system makes → Linux/kernel internal information and kernel → Linux/kernel/process[processes] available to user-space processes.
-
The information about the process with the PID `$pid` is found under `→ Linux/fhs/proc/pid`.

Special files permit to change the system's current configuration.
