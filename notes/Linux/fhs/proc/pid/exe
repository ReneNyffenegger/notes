$ /proc/$pid/exe

`/proc/$pid/exe` is a symbolic link to the executable of the process whose PID is `$pid`.

The following simple shell command iterates over all processes and lists their executables:
code {
for proc in /proc/[1-9]*/; do pid=$(→ Linux/shell/commands/basename $proc); printf "%5d: %s\n" $pid $(→ Linux/shell/commands/readlink $proc/exe); done
code }

sa:

 `→ Linux/fhs/proc/pid`
