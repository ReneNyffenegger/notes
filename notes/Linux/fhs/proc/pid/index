{ Subdirectories (and files?)

  table { ll
    `attr` ☰ API for security modules (originally added for SELinux), present only if Kernel was compiled with `CONFIG_SECURITY`.
    `autogroup` ☰ See `man 7 sched`
    `auxv` ☰ Contents of the ELF interpreter information passed to the process at exec time. See also `man 3 getauxval`, `man 7 vdso`, the field `saved_auxv` in → Linux/kernel/source/include/linux/mm_types_h#linux-mm_struct[`struct mm_struct`] and `Elf64_auxv_t` (defined in the GNU version of `elf.h`?).
    → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/cgroups[`cgroups`] ☰ lists a → Linux/kernel/process[process'] → Linux/kernel/cgroup membership.
    `clear_refs` ☰ Clears page referenced bits shown in smaps output
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/cmdline[`cmdline`] ☰ A read-only file that stores a process's complete command line unless the process is a zombie.
    `comm` ☰ 
    `coredump_filter` ☰ See `man 5 core`
    → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/cpuset[`cpuset`] ☰ Displays the path of the process's cpuset directory relative to the root of the cpuset filesystem.
    `cwd` ☰ *Symbolic link* to the process's current working directory
    `environ` ☰ The process's initial environment (environment variables). Entries are separated by null bytes and can be displayed with `cat /proc/$pid/environ | tr '\000' '\n'`)
    → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/exe[`exe`] ☰ A *symbolic link* to the actual executable that is being executed by the process. See also the field `exe` in → Linux/kernel/source/include/linux/mm_types_h#linux-mm_struct[`struct mm_struct`].
    → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/fd[`fd`] ☰ Contains files whose name is numeric and corresponds to the process' filehandle with this number. These files are *symbolic links*, either to the physical files, or pipes etc.
    `fdinfo` ☰
    `gid_map` ☰ See `man 7 user_namespaces`
    → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/io[`io`] ☰ I/O statistics
    `limits` ☰ Soft and hard limits, and their units of measurements 
    `map_files` ☰
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/maps[`maps`] ☰ Currently mapped memory regions and their access permissions.
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/mem[`mem`] ☰ Access a process's memory.
    `mountinfo` ☰
    `mounts` ☰
    `mountstats` ☰
    → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/net[`net`] ☰ See also `→ Linux/fhs/proc/net`
    `ns` ☰ namespaces, see `man 7 namespaces`
    `numa_maps` ☰ An extension based on `maps`, showing the memory locality and binding policy as well as mem usage (in pages) of each mapping.
    `oom_adj` ☰ *Deprecated* in favor of `/oom_score_adj`
    `oom_score` ☰
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/oom_score_adj[`oom_score_adj`] ☰
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/pagemap[`pagemap`] ☰ Mapping of virtual pages to physical page frams or swap area.
    `personality` ☰
    `root` ☰ The per-process filesystem root (`chroot`)
    `seccomp` ☰
    `setgroups` ☰
    `smaps` ☰ Memory consumption for the process's mappings (The `pmap` command shows similar information)
    `stack` ☰ Symbolic trace of function calls in kerne. stack (requires `CONFIG_STACKTRACE`)
    `projid_map` ☰
    `smaps_rollup` ☰ Accumulated smaps stats for all mappings of the proces.  This can be derived from `smaps`, but is faster and more convenient
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/stat[`stat`] ☰ Process status. See also → https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/proc/array.c[`fs/proc/array.c`]
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/statm[`statm`] ☰ Memory usage
     → Linux/fhs/proc/pid/status[`status`] ☰ Displays the information of `stat` and `statm` in a more human friendly way.
