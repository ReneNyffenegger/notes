$ /proc/diskstats

`/proc/diskstats` displays the I/O statistics of → Linux/devices#block-devices[block devices].

As far as I can tell, `/proc/diskstats` is one of or the major source of data for `→ Linux/shell/commands/iostat` (and possibly also for `sar`).

Each line in `/proc/diskstats` contains the following 18 fields: All values except the first three and *I/Os currently in progress* are cumulative since startup.
