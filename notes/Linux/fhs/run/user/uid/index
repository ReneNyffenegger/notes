$ /run/user/$uid

`/run/user/$uid` is created by → https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/pam_systemd.html[`pam_systemd`] and used to store *non-essential runtime files* or objects, such as sockets, named pipes, keyring daemon files, pulseaudio files etc.

This directory is owned by the → Linux/user whose uid is $uid.
-
The permission bits for this directory need to be `0700`.

The directory is created when the user (with $uid) logs in and is destroyed when he logs out again.

The environment variable `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` might(?) point to this directory (compare → Linux/X/XDG)

sa:

  Prior to → Linux/init/systemd, the files that are now stored in `/run/user/$uid` were typically stored in `→ Linux/fhs/tmp`.
  -
  Using `→ Linux/fhs/home/username` was not practical because this directory was often mounted over network filesystems.

 `→ Linux/fhs/run`
