$ /run

`/run` contains *run-time variable data* that describes the system since it was booted. Apparently, the directory and its subdirectories also expose userspace sockets and files.

`→ Linux/fhs/run/utmp` records → Linux/user[users] that are currently logged in.

  `→ Linux/fhs/var/log/wtmp`, `→ Linux/fhs/var/log/lastlog`

  `→ Linux/fhs/run/initramfs`,
  `→ Linux/fhs/run/shm`,
  `→ Linux/fhs/run/systemd`,
  `→ Linux/fhs/run/user/uid`
