$ /tmp

`/tmp` is the root directory for temporary files and directories. This directory
is usually world writable and used as a scratch space.

It's often cleared when a system is rebooted. To keep temporary data across reboots, use `→ Linux/fhs/var/tmp`.

Usually, the `/tmp` directory has the → Linux/filesystem/file-directory-metadata#sticky-bit[sticky bit] set.

sa:

  The → Linux/shell command → Linux/shell/commands/mktemp[`mktemp`] creates temporary directories or files.

  → development/languages/JavaScript/Node_js#node-js-tmp-dir[Node.js: `os.tmp-dir`]

 `→ Linux/fhs/usr/tmp`

 `→ Linux/fhs/dev/shm`

 A prominent command that uses `/tmp` by default is `→ Linux/shell/commands/sort` (but see also its `-T` option).

 `→ Linux/fhs/run/user/uid`
