$ /boot

The `/boot` directory contains the → Linux/kernel, the → Linux/kernel/initial-ram-disk[ramdisk images], → development/boot-loader[the bootloader configuration file] and the bootloader stages.

This directory is only used during the → Linux/booting[boot process].

? Allegedly, `/boot` cannot be on a XFS fileystem or on a LVM.

? Also allegedly, `/boot` is required when using software RAID 0.

  `→ Linux/fhs/boot/efi`

  `→ Linux/fhs/boot/grub`
