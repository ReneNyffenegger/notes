$ /sbin/installkernel

`/sbin/installkernel` is a → Linux/shell/script that installs the → Linux/kernel (on a → Linux/distributions/Debian Linux system?)

This script is called from `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/install.sh.`

The script is likely to be executed as follows:
code {
exec "${file}" "${KERNELRELEASE}" "${KBUILD_IMAGE}" System.map "${INSTALL_PATH}"
code }

If installed under `/sbin/installkernel`, it's possible to call `make install` from a generic kernel source tree and the image will be installed to the proper place for Debian GNU/Linux.
