$ /sbin/installkernel

`/sbin/installkernel` is a → Linux/shell/script that installs the → Linux/kernel (on a → Linux/distributions/Debian Linux system?)

This script is called from `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/install.sh.`

The script is likely to be executed as follows:
code {
exec "${file}" "${KERNELRELEASE}" "${KBUILD_IMAGE}" System.map "${INSTALL_PATH}"
code }

If installed under `/sbin/installkernel`, it's possible to call `make install` from a generic kernel source tree and the image will be installed to the proper place for Debian GNU/Linux.

sa:
  `/sbin/installkernel` is mentioned in the Linux kernel source `→ Linux/kernel/source/Makefile`. Is it invoked by calling → Linux/kernel/compilation/make/install[`make install`] in the → Linux/kernel/source?
