$ /mnt/wsl/

`/mnt/wsl` is a *tmpfs* filesystem:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/mount | → Linux/shell/commands/grep  '/mnt/wsl\>'
none on /mnt/wsl type tmpfs (rw,relatime)
code }

As per → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/11997#issuecomment-2371742646[this comment], WSL creates different mount namepsaces for distributions, and `/mnt/wsl` is a mountpoint that all namespaces share.

{ resolv.conf

  At least in my → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux[WSL] installation `→ Linux/fhs/etc/resolv_conf` is a symbolic link to `/mnt/wsl/resolv.conf`.

}
