$ /bin

`/bin` must not contain any subdirectories.

`/bin` is often a symlink to → Linux/fhs/usr/bin.

`/bin` was separated from `/usr/bin` in Unix 3rd edition. (`/usr` was then usually mounted as a second hard drive, so `/bin` contained core functions while `/usr/bin` contained more user oriented functions).

sa:

 `→ Linux/fhs/bin/sh`

 `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_local/bin`
