$ /snap

`/snap` stores installed → Linux/package-managers/Snap[snap] packages.

{ Sub directories

table { ll
  `/snap/bin`                   ☰ Symlinks to snap applications.
  `/snap/<snapname>/<revision>` ☰ Mountpoint for snap content.
  `/snap/<snapname>/current`    ☰ Symlink to current revision, if enabled.
table }

}

{ Space usage

  The disk space consumed by the content under this directory is minimal as the real snap content never leaves the `.snap` file.

  Snaps are *mounted* rather than unpacked.
