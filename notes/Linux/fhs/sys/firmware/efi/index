$ /sys/firmware/efi

In this directory, the → Linux/kernel exposes EFI variables to userspace.

The existence of the `/sys/firmware/efi` directory means that the kernel has (probably) booted in → hardware/UEFI/index[EFI mode].

In order to have this directory, the kernel needs the → Linux/kernel/kernel-parameters[parameter] `CONFIG_EFI_VARS_FS` to be set.
