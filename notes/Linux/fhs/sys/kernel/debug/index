$ /sys/kernel/debug

`/sys/kernel/debug` is the directory on which *debugfs* is typically mounted.

The purpose of this file system is to make information available to user space. 
-
It differs from `→ Linux/fhs/proc` in that `/proc` makes process related information information available.
-
It also differs from the *sysfs* file system (`→ Linux/fhs/sys`) because sysfs allows one value per file only and `/sys/kernel/debug` explicitely does not state any rule on the format of its files.

sa:

 `→ Linux/fhs/sys/kernel`, `→ Linux/fhs/sys/kernel/tracing`

  → Linux/kernel/ftrace
