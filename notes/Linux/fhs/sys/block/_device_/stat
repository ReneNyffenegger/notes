$ /sys/block/_device_/stat

`/sys/block/_device_/stat` provides several statistics about the state of the → Linux/devices#block-devices[block device] `_device_`.

  { Details

    *read I/Os*, *write I/Os*, *discard I/0s* and *flush I/Os* are incremented when an I/O request completes.

    *flush I/Os*: Block layer combines flush requests and executes at most one at a time. This counts flush requests are executed by disk and not tracked for partitions.

    *read merges*,* write merges* and *discard merges* are incremented when an I/O request is merged with an already-queued I/O request.

    *read sectors*, *write sectors* and *discard_sectors* count the number of sectors read from, written to, or discarded from this block device and are incremented when the I/O completes.
     -
     The size of *sectors* is the standard → Linux/kernel/source/include/linux/blk_types_h#linux-block-size[UNIX 512-byte], not any device- or filesystem-specific block size.

    *read ticks*, *write ticks*, *discard ticks* and *flush ticks* count the number of milliseconds that I/O requests have waited on this block device.
     -
     The waiting time for *each* requestor will be summed up: if 60 read requests wait for an average of 30 ms, the read_ticks field will increase by 60*30 = 1800.

    *in_flight* counts the number of I/O requests that have been issued to the device driver but have not yet completed.
     -
     It does not include I/O requests that are in the queue but not yet issued to the device driver.

    *io_ticks*:  This value counts the number of milliseconds during which the device has had I/O requests queued.

    *time_in_queue* counts the number of milliseconds that I/O requests have waited on this block device.
    -
    If there are multiple I/O requests waiting, this value will increase as the product of the number of milliseconds times
    the number of requests waiting (see *read ticks* above for an example).

{ Misc

  While *sysfs* normally writes single statistics into individual files, these statistics are written into a single file so that reading the file gets a consistent snapshot of the statistics.
