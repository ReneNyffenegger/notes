$ /sys

The → Linux/filesystem/sysfs filesystem is *the* filesystem to export kernel objects (→ Linux/kernel/kobject). It is usually mounted on `/sys`. It contains information about
→ Linux/devices#block-devices[block devices] (→ Linux/fhs/sys/block) and other kernel stuff (Compare with `→ Linux/fhs/sys/kernel/debug/

Every registered → Linux/kernel/kobject creates a directory in or under `/sys`.

A rule mandates that every file in the sysfs must have one value only. `→ Linux/fhs/sys/kernel/debug` does not belong to the sysfs and therefore, this rule does not apply there).

The sysfs needs the `CONFIG_SYSFS` configuration option.

{ Subdirectories

  Find subdirectories from in the top level Linux kernel directory with
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/grep -hrPo '(?<!/proc)/sys/[0-9a-zA-Z_\-]+/' 2>→ Linux/fhs/dev/null | → Linux/shell/commands/sort -u
code }

sa:

  Don't confuse `/sys` with `→ Linux/fhs/proc/sys`

 *sysfs* was originally called *ddfs* (Device Driver Filesystem). Originally, sysfs was based on *ramfs*.
