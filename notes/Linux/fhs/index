$ filesystem hierarchy standard 
abbr: FHS


The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a reference describing the conventions used for the layout of a UNIX system.

/      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

→ Linux/fhs/bin/index[`/fhs/bin`] This directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or repair it.

→ Linux/fhs/boot/index[`/fhs/boot`] Contains static files for the boot loader.
  -
  This directory holds only the files which are needed during the boot process.
  -
  The map installer and configuration files should go to → Linux/fhs/sbin/index[`/sbin`] and → Linux/fhs/etc/index[`/etc`].
  -
  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either / or /boot.

→ Linux/fhs/dev/index[`/dev`] Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.
  -
  See → Linux/shell/commands/mknod[`mknod (1)`].

→ Linux/fhs/etc/index[`/etc`] Contains configuration files which are local to the machine.
-
Some larger software packages, like → Linux/X[X11], can have their own subdirectories below /etc: → Linux/fhs/etc/X11/[`/etc/X11`]


rem {
Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or  in  /usr/etc.   Nevertheless,
       programs should always look for these files in /etc and you may have links for these files to /usr/etc.
rem }

→ Linux/fhs/etc/opt/index[`/etc/opt`] Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications installed in → Linux/fhs/opt[`/opt`].

rem {
/etc/sgml
       This directory contains the configuration files for SGML (optional).
}

→ Linux/fhs/etc/skel[`/etc/skel`] When a new → Linux/user[user account] is created, files from this directory are usually copied into the user's home directory.


rem {
/etc/xml
       This directory contains the configuration files for XML (optional).
rem }


→ Linux/fhs/home/index[`/home`] »Home« directories for users. The entire path for a user whose name is `username` is located under → Linux/fhs/home/username/[`/home/username`] and can be referred to in a
→ Linux/shell[shell] with the tilde `~`.

→ Linux/fhs/lib/index[`/lib`]   This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot the system and to run the commands in the root filesystem.

`/lib<qual>`
       These directories are variants of /lib on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries.

→ Linux/fhs/lib/modules/index[`/lib/modules`] Loadable kernel modules.

`/lost+found` This directory contains items lost in the filesystem.  These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a consequence of a faulty disk or a system crash.

→ Linux/fhs/media/index[`/media`] contains  mount  points for removable media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.
  -
  On systems where more than one device exists for mounting a certain type of media, mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of those available above starting with '0', but the unqualified name must also exist.

rem {
/media/floppy[1-9] Floppy drive (optional).

/media/cdrom[1-9]
       CD-ROM drive (optional).

/media/cdrecorder[1-9]
       CD writer (optional).

/media/zip[1-9]
       Zip drive (optional).

/media/usp[1-9]
       USB drive (optional).
rem }

→ Linux/fhs/mnt/index[`/mnt`] holds mount points for temporarily mounted filesystems.
-
In some distributions, `/mnt` contains subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for several temporary filesystems.

→ Linux/fhs/opt/index[`/opt`] contains add-on packages that contain static files.

→ Linux/fhs/proc/index[`/proc`] The mount point for the → Linux/filesystem/filesystems#proc[proc] → Linux/filesystem[filesystem], which provides information about running processes and the kernel.

→ Linux/fhs/root/index[`/root`] is usually the home directory for the root user.

→ Linux/fhs/sbin/index[`/sbin`]  Like `/bin`, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually not executed by normal users.

→ Linux/fhs/srv/index[`/srv`] contains site-specific data that is served by this system.
-
Sub directories might be `/srv/http` or `/srv/ftp`.

→ Linux/fhs/sys/index[`/sys`] mount point for the → Linux/filesystem/sysfs[sysfs] filesystem. (Compare → Linux/fhs/proc[`/proc`])

→ Linux/fhs/tmp/index[`/tmp`] contains temporary files which may be deleted without notice, usually at system boot up, but also by a regular job. Compare with → Linux/fhs/var/tmp/[`/var/tmp`].

→ Linux/fhs/usr/index[`/usr`] should only contain sharable, read-only data, so that it can be mounted by 
various Linux installations.
-
Thus, it is usually mounted from a separate partition.

rem {
/usr/X11R6
       The X-Window system, version 11 release 6 (optional).

/usr/X11R6/bin
       Binaries which belong to the X-Window system; often, there is a symbolic link from the more traditional /usr/bin/X11 to here.

/usr/X11R6/lib
       Data files associated with the X-Window system.

/usr/X11R6/lib/X11
       These contain miscellaneous files needed to run X;  Often, there is a symbolic link from /usr/lib/X11 to this directory.

/usr/X11R6/include/X11
       Contains include files needed for compiling programs using the X11 window system.  Often, there is a symbolic link from /usr/include/X11 to this directory.
rem }

→ Linux/fhs/usr/bin/index[`/usr/bin`] is the primary directory for executable programs which are not necessary for booting or repairing a system and run by »normal« users.

rem {
/usr/bin/mh
       Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).

/usr/bin/X11
       is the traditional place to look for X11 executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/bin.

/usr/dict
       Replaced by /usr/share/dict.


/usr/doc
       Replaced by /usr/share/doc.

/usr/etc
       Site-wide configuration files to be shared between several machines may be stored in this directory.  However, commands should always reference those files using the /etc directory.  Links from files in  /etc  should  point  to  the
       appropriate files in /usr/etc.
