$ ~/.bash_profile

`~/.bash_profile` is the personal initialization file that is executed for login shells. (Compare → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bashrc)

`~/.bash_profile` should just load → Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile and then → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bashrc (in that order).

{ .bash_profile and .profile

  When bash is invoked as a login shell, it tries to read `~/.bash_profile`. If it does not exist, it tries to read from 
  → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_profile and if this file does not exist from → Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile instead.

  Since → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_login should not exist, the .bash_profile should include .profile:
code {
if [ -r ~/.profile ]; then
      . ~/.profile
fi
code }

}


sa:
  → Linux/fhs/etc/profile
