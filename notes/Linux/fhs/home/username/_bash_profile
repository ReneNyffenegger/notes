$ ~/.bash_profile

`~/.bash_profile` is the personal initialization file that is executed for login shells. (Compare `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_bashrc`)

`~/.bash_profile` should just load `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile` and then `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_bashrc` (in that order).

{ .bash_profile and .profile

  When bash is invoked as a login shell, it tries to read `~/.bash_profile`. If it does not exist, it tries to read from 
  → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_login and if this file does not exist from → Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile instead.

  Since `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_login` should not exist, the `.bash_profile` file should include `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile`:
code {
if [ -r ~/.profile ]; then
      . ~/.profile
fi
code }

}


sa:
 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/profile`
