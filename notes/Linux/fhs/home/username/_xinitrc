$ ~/.xinitrc

The → Linux/fhs/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc script is a shell script that is usually read by → Linux/X/xinit when the → Linux/X[X Server] is started.

{ Starting programs

  If the script starts programs (such a `xscreensaver` or `xsetroot`) it is important to start them in the background (with `&`) so that the script doesn't wait
  until they're finished.
  -
  However, the last program that is started by `.xinitrc` is usually a → Linux/X/window-manager or a terminal emulator (such as `xterm`) is started in the foreground so that the
  script doesn't exit.

}
{ Exiting from .xinitrc

  When .xinitrc exits, it indicates to → Linux/X/xinit that the → Linux/user is done with the X session and that in turn `xinit` should exit as well.

}

sa:
  The system-wide xinitrc script is `→ Linux/fhs/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc`.
