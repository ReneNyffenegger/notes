  Files I've found under `→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_openclaw[~/.openclaw]/workspace` include
  table { ll
    `AGENTS.md` ☰ Loaded when a session starts
    `BOOTSTRAP.md` ☰ Used to figure out who you are. Can then be safely deleted (in fact, it is deleted after answering the first prompt after executing `openclaw onboard`). Maybe this file is needed because no memory exists when you just woke up. Compare with `SOUL.md` (and possibly with `BOOT.md`)
    `HEARTBEAT.md` ☰ Defines tasks that the agent should check periodically (default: once per hour?)
    `IDENTITY.md` ☰ Name, creature, vibe, emoji, avatar. Created from the answer of the first prompt after executing `openclaw onboard`.
    `SOUL.md` ☰ Defines who OpenClaw impersonates. Compare with `BOOTSTRAP.md` and `SOUL_EVIL.md`
    `TOOLS.md` ☰ Camera names, SSH details, voice preferences for TTS, speaker/room names, device nick names ‥
    `USER.md` ☰ The user who you are helping: Name, how to call him/her, timezone, notes ‥
    `MEMORY.md` ☰ Created after answering the first prompat after executing `openclaw onboard`. This file will grow as the user works together with OpenClaw. This file stores significant learnings, patterns, preferences, and insights.
  table }

}
{ Git repository

  If `git` is installed on the system, OpenClaw creates this directory as a git repository (which contains a `.git` directory) without any commits after installing OpenClaw.

  The idea is to be able to create a backup of the workspace or use a workspace on multiple devices.

}
{ TODO

  Will there be created a `memory\YYYY-MM-DD` file to store recent context of today and yesterday? (Corresponding to short-term memory)

  Will there be created a `MEMORY.md` file which roughly corresponds to long-term memory?

  Will there be created a `SKILL.md` file?

  Is there also a `BOOT.md` filee which is run when the gateyway starts up?


  Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` again.
