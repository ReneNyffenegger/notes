    `AGENTS.md` ☰
    `BOOTSTRAP.md` ☰ Used to figure out who you are. Can then be safely deleted. Maybe this file is needed because no memory exists when you just woke up. Compare with `SOUL.md`
    `HEARTBEAT.md` ☰
    `IDENTITY.md` ☰ Name, creature, vibe, emoji, avatar
    `SOUL.md` ☰ Defines who you are. Compare with `BOOTSTRAP.md` and `SOUL_EVIL.md`
    `TOOLS.md` ☰ Camera names, SSH details, voice preferences for TTS, speaker/room names, device nick names ‥
    `USER.md` ☰ The user who you are helping: Name, how to call him/her, timezone, notes ‥

{ TODO

  Will there be created a `memory\YYYY-MM-DD` file to store recent context of today and yesterday? (Corresponding to short-term memory)

  Will there be created a `MEMORY.md` file which roughly corresponds to long-term memory?

  Will there be created a `SKILL.md` file?

  Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` again.
