$ ~/.npm-global

Two directories I've seen under `~/.npm-global` re
  • `lib`
  • `bin`

It seems that these directories are populated with commands such as `npm i -g <package-name>`.

I also found `~/.npm-global/bin` to be in my `$PATH` environment variable (and being added to `$PATH` in `~/.bashrc`).
