$ /home/username (Home directory)

`/home/username` is often the → Linux/home-directory[home directory] for the → Linux/user[user] whose name is `username`. However, it should not be assumed that this is always the case, rather, the
libc functions `getpwent` and `getpwent_r` should be used to determine a user's home directory.
