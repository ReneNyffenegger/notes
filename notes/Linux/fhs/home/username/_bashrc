$ ~/.bashrc

`~/.bashrc` is executed for interactive non-→ Linux/shell[login shells].

Apparently, it should contain elements that are not inherited through the environment, such as aliases and functions.
Since (exported?) → development/environment-variable[environment variables] are inherited to child → Linux/kernel/process[processes],
env var definitions can and should go to → Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile).
