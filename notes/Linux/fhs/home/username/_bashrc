$ ~/.bashrc

`~/.bashrc` is executed for interactive non-→ Linux/shell[login shells].

Apparently, it should contain elements that are not inherited through the environment, such as aliases and functions.
Since (exported?) → development/environment-variable[environment variables] are inherited to child → Linux/kernel/process[processes],
env var definitions can and should go to → Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile).

Beacause .bashrc is also read during *non-interactive SSH command execution*, it should start with a
check for interactiveness:
code {
if [[ "$_" != *i* ]]; then
# Not running interactively
  return
fi
code }
