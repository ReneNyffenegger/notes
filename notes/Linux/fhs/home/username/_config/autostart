$ ~/.config/autostart/

It's possible to autostart applications during the startup of a desktop environment and after mounting a removable medium by placing a `*.desktop` file into the `~/.cofnig/autostart` directory.
-
The details of this technique are drafted in  → https://specifications.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html[Desktop Application Autostart Specification].

{ .desktop file format

  The `.desktop` file format is specified → https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/[in this document].
  -
  Some noteable specifications:
    • Files are encoded in → development/Unicode/UTF-8
    • The *entries* in the file are key-value pairs, separated by an equal sign (`abc=def`)
    • The possible types of the values are: string, localestring, iconstring, boolean or numeric.

     ~Name~ ☰ ☰ ~Type~
     `Type` ☰ `Application`, `Link` or `Directory`  ☰ string

     `GenericName` ☰ Generic name of the application, for example *Web Browser*. ☰ localestring
     `NoDisplay` ☰ Used to not display an application in the menus.

     `Comment` ☰ Tooltip for the entry ☰ localestring
     `Icon` ☰ Icon to display. If the name is not an absolute path, the algorithm described in the *Icon Theme Specification* will be used to locate the icon. ☰ iconstring

     `OnlyShowIn`, `NotShowIn` ☰ A list of strings identifying the desktop environments that should display/not display a given desktop entry. ☰ string(s)
     `DBusActivatable` ☰ If the value is true or missing then implementations should ignore the `Exec` key and send a → Linux/D-Bus message to launch the application. ☰ boolean
     `TryExec` ☰ Path to an executable file on disk used to determine if the program is actually installed. ☰ string
     `Exec` ☰ Program to execute, possibly with arguments. See the Exec key for details on how this key works. Required if `DBusActivatable` is not set to true. ☰ string
     `Path` ☰ If `Type=Application`: the working directory to run the program in. ☰ string
     `Terminal` ☰ Whether the program runs in a terminal window. ☰ boolean
