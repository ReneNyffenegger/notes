$ ~/.profile

Executed by login → Linux/shell[shells] and → Linux/X#x-display-manager[display managers].

`~/.profile` is sourced after → Linux/fhs/etc/profile

`~/.profile` contains settings that are not specifically related to a specific → Linux/shell.

→ Linux/shell/bash does not read this file if either → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_profile or
→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_login exists.


? There is little point in having both `~/.profile` and → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_profile.
