$ ~/.netrc

`~/.netrc` is used by the → development/web/FTP#ftp-command-line[command line ftp tool] (and → tools/lftp) to automatically login or execute commands.

Permission of `~/.netrc` should only be readable for owner, otherwise ftp will complain
code {
Error - .netrc file not correct permissions.
Remove → development/security/password[password] or correct mode (should be 600).
code }

{ macdef

  `macdef MacroName` defines a macro. The macro can be called in the `ftp` client by prepending its name with a `$` sign:
code {
$ MacroName
code }

  Macros must be terminated with an emtpy line.

 ? Macros apply to the most recent `machine` statement seen.
