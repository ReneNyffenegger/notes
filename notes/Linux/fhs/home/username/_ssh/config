$ ~/.ssh/config

`~/.ssh/config` is a user's (default) → development/security/SSH → development/security/SSH/configuration#ssh-config-file[configuration file].

In order to prevent abuse of this file, its  permissions must (should?) be set to  read/write for the user, and not writable by others.

sa:

  The system wide configuration file is located under `→ Linux/fhs/etc/ssh/ssh_config`)

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/man 5 ssh_config`
