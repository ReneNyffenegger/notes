$ ~/.ssh/known_hosts

`~/.ssh/known_hosts` is a user's → development/security/SSH/known-hosts[known hosts file] which contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged into that are not already in the systemwide list of known host keys.

The following command gets a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art for all known hosts:
code {
$ → development/security/SSH/commands/keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
code }

{ known_hosts does not exist

  → https://stackoverflow.com/a/68333169/180275[This Stackoverflow answer] suggests to use `ssh` to create `~/.ssh/known_hosts` if it does not exist.
code {
$ ssh-keygen -R 192.168.0.103
Cannot stat /home/rene/.ssh/known_hosts: No such file or directory

$ ssh rene@192.168.0.103
…
code }

}

sa:

 `→ development/security/SSH/commands/keygen -F`
  -
 `→ development/security/SSH/commands/keygen -H`
  -
 `→ development/security/SSH/commands/keygen -R`

 `man sshd`
