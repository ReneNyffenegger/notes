$ /usr/lib/crt1.o

This → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/object-file[object file] contains the `_start` entry point which bootstraps execution of a program (and eventually calls `main()`).

The → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc[GNU lib c] defines it in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/libc/src/sysdeps/x86_64/elf/start_S.


sa:

  → Linux/fhs/usr/lib/crtn_o[`/usr/lib/crtn.o`]

  Compare with the → Windows CRT startup code in → Windows/development/CRT/source/crt0_c[`crt0.c`]

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/main[`main()`]

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/no/stdlib[`gcc -nostdlib`]

  Apparently, `crt1.o` is sometimes also found under `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`.

 `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib`
