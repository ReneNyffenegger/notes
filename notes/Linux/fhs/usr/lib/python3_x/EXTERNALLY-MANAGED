$ /usr/lib/python3.x/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED

`EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` is a *marker file* that, if present, indicates that non-virtual-environment package installations are managed by some means external to Python (such a Linux distribution’s package manager).

This file is specified to live in the `stdlib` directory in the default `sysconfig` scheme, which marks the interpreter / installation as a whole (in Debian, the `stdlib` directory appears to be `/usr/lib/python3.x`).
