$ /usr/share/doc

{ Debian

  Data related to a package is stored in a subdirectory with the name of the package (i. e. `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE`).

  The → Linux/distributions/Debian#debian-policy-manual stipulates in → https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#additional-documentation[section 12.3] that «a package must not require the existence of `/usr/share/doc` in order to function», i. e. the directory can be removed
  without causing any programs to break.
