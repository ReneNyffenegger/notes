$ /usr/share/distro-info

The `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share[/usr/share]/distro-info` contains → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV files each of which constains a Linux distribution's «version history».

  `version` ☰
  `codename` ☰
  `series` ☰
  `created` ☰
  `release` ☰
  `eol` ☰
  `eol-lts` ☰
  `eol-elts` ☰
table }

 `lsb_release.py` is a → development/languages/Python package that consumes these CSV files. `lsb_release`, in turn, is used by the
  Python script `→ Linux/shell/commands/lsb_release`.
