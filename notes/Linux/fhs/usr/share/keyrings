$ /usr/share/keyrings/
@ /usr/share/keyrings

`/usr/share/keyrings` is a directory

`man sources.list` says that `/usr/share/keyrings` is the recommended location for keyrings managed by packages (while `/etc/apt/keyrings` is the recommended location for keyrings managed by the system operator).

At least on my system, the files under `/usr/share/keyrings` are exclusively `*.gpg` files.

A file under `/usr/share/keyrings` might be referenced in a file found in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/apt/sources_list_d`.
