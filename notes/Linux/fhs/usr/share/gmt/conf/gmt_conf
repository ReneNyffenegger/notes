$ /usr/share/gmt/conf/gmt.conf

This file is read by → tools/GMT at run time to initialize all default variable.s

Instead of using the system wide GMT default values, a user can specify his defaults in → Linux/fhs/home/username/gmt_conf.

Actually, when a GMT program starts up, it first looks for a `gmt.conf` file in the current directory (which can be
set with → tools/GMT/programs/gmtset).
