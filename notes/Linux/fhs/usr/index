$ /usr

Traditionally, `/usr` contains files that come with the → Linux/distributions[distribution] while
→ Linux/fhs/usr/local[`/usr/local`] is thought for local addtions by a user (or better yet: system administrator).

? Because `/etc` is used in the → Linux/kernel/boot-process (as is also → Linux/fhs/etc[`/etc`]), it shoud be in the *root partition*.

`/usr` should only contain sharable, read-only data, so that it can be → Linux/shell/commands/mount[mounted] by various Linux installations.
