$ /usr/bin/cpp

The preprocessor.

`cpp` is not bo be confused with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/CPP[c++].

The preprocessor is concerned with things like
  • macro expansion
  • removing comments
  • trigraph conversion
  • escaped newline splicing
  • processing of directives

Newer version of → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[gcc] don't invoke `/usr/bin/cpp` directly for preprocessing a translation unit. Rather, the preprocessing is performed
by the *compiler proper* → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/cc1[`cc1`].

sa:

  → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/f/preprocessed[`gcc -fpreprocessed`]

  → Linux/fhs/usr/bin
