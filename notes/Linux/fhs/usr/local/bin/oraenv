$ /usr/local/bin/oraenv
@ oraenv

`oraenv` is a shell script used to set → development/environment-variable (aka «Oracle environment»?) in a *Bourne shell*.

The script prompts the user for the database SID except if the environment variable `ORAENV_ASK` is not set to `no` in which case the current value of `ORACLE_SID` is used.
-
The special value `*` (asterisk) can b e 

code {
$ source /usr/local/bin/oraenv
code }

In order to trace the execution of the script, the environment variable `ORACLE_TRACE` can be set to `T` (which causes `set -x`)

From a C-shell, the script `coraenv` should be executed instead.
