$ /usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9.x
@ !SASROOT

The *!SASROOT* directory is created when SAS is installed on a system.  The default location (directory)
is `/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9.x`, but it can be stored anywhere in a file system (x = release). (Apparently, under Windows,
the default location is `c:\program files\SASHome`).
-
The !SASROOT directory is the root for all SAS Foundation products.


`→ Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x/sas`: the SAS executable that is used to invoke a SAS session.
There are language aware executables under `!SASROOT/bin`, for exmaple `!SASROOT/bin/sas_en` for english sessions etc.

`!SASROOT/sasv9.cfg`: the main configuration file. It is independent from the language used when a SAS session was started.
-
Language dependent configuration files can be put under → Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x/nls/_lang_

→ Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x/sasv9_local_cfg[`sasv9_local.cfg`] used to override settings in → Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x/sasv9_cfg[`sasv9.cfg`]

`→ Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x/sasautos[!SASROOT/sasautos]` contains some predefined → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros[macros].

{ Setting root to executables

  After installing the SAS system, → Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x/utilities/bin/patchname[`patchname`] must be executed to
  set the sas root.
