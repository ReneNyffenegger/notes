$ /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)

{ Debian

  At least Debian seems to install Linux kernel header files not directly under `→ Linux/fhs/usr/include/linux` but in a «versioned» directroy named after the result of `→ Linux/shell/commands/uname -r`.

  The Debian/APT package `linux-headers-$(uname -r)` contains some of the files located in this directory.

  Compare with the APT package `linux-image-$(uname -r)`
