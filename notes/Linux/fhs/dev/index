$ /dev

`/dev` contains files that represent hardware («devices», hence the name `/dev`) or pseudo devices (such as `→ Linux/fhs/dev/null`, `→ Linux/fhs/dev/zero`, `→ Linux/fhs/dev/random`, …).
-
The presences of a file does not necessarily mean that the corresponding device is attached to the computer.

For devices that contain partitionable file systems (such as the SCSI drive → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[`/dev/sda`], a device file for each parition is allocated (`/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sda2` …).

rem {
All → Linux/device-file[device files] should be located in the `/dev` directory.

Many (if not all «files» in `/dev` are block or character special files (and → Linux/shell/commands/ls/l[`ls -l`] reports them with → Linux/shell/commands/ls/l#ls-l-type[`b` or `c` file type]).
