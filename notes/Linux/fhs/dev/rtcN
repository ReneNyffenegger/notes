$ /dev/rtcN

While `→ Linux/fhs/dev/rtc` reports → hardware/PC/real-time-clock signals for → hardware/ACPI and → hardware/PC platforms, `/dev/rtcN` (where N is a number) supports other real time clock
models.

sa:

 `→ Linux/fhs/sys/class/rtc/rtcN`,
 `→ Linux/fhs/dev/rtc`
  
  This interface seems to be testable with → Linux/kernel/source/tools/testing/selftests/timers/rtctest_c.
