$ /dev/input

Files I encountered under `/dev/input` include
table { ll
  → Linux/fhs/dev/input/eventX[`event0` … `event16`] ☰
  → Linux/fhs/dev/input/mice[`mice`] ☰
  `mouse0` … `mouse2` ☰
table }

In addition there were also two directories: `by-id` and `by-path`.

sa:

  → Linux/kernel/input

  The parent directory `→ Linux/fhs/dev`
