$ /dev/input

Files I've encountered under `/dev/input` or might be present include
table { ll
  → Linux/fhs/dev/input/eventX[`event0` … `event16`] ☰ Event queues.
  → Linux/fhs/dev/input/mice[`mice`] ☰ Unified mouse
  `mouse0` … `mouse2` ☰
  `jsN` ☰ Joysticks
table }

In addition there were also two directories: `by-id` and `by-path`.

Some (all?) of the file names found in `/dev/input` are also present under `→ Linux/fhs/sys/class/input`.

{ Capturing mouse movements

  `/dev/input/mouse3` (why `mouse3`?) emits data when the mouse is moved: 
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/shell/commands/cat /dev/input/mouse3
code }

}
{ TODO

code {
sudo gpm -m /dev/input/mice -t help
code }

 `mev` is a program to report mouse events:
code {
mev
code }

}

  → Linux/kernel/input

  The parent directory `→ Linux/fhs/dev`
