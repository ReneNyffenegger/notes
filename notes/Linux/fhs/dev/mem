$ /dev/mem

`/dev/mem` provides physical → Linux/memory access, compare with `→ Linux/fhs/dev/kmem`.

Apparently, `/dev/mem` is created in `→ Linux/kernel/source/drivers/char/mem_c`.

{ CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM

  The help text for `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` (`lib/Kconfig.debug`) reads
  "
	  If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all
	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
	  be used by people debugging the kernel. Note that with PAT support
	  enabled, even in this case there are restrictions on /dev/mem
	  use due to the cache aliasing requirements.

	  If this option is switched on, and IO_STRICT_DEVMEM=n, the /dev/mem
	  file only allows userspace access to PCI space and the BIOS code and
	  data regions.  This is sufficient for dosemu and X and all common
	  users of /dev/mem.
