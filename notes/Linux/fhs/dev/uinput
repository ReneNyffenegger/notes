$ /dev/uinput

By writing to `/dev/uinput` (or `/dev/input/uinput`), a → Linux/kernel/process can create a virtual input device with specific capabilities. Once this virtual device is
created, the process can send events through it, that will be delivered to userspace and in-kernel consumers.

? Virtual input devices seem to show up as files named `inputN` under `→ Linux/fhs/sys/devices/virtual/input`.

  Kernel source: `Documentation/input/uinput.rst`

  The parent directory `→ Linux/fhs/dev`
