$ /dev/shm

`/dev/shm` can be used to share data between processes.

This directory is also (or only?) the place where *named semaphores* are created.

Apparently, on some systems, `/dev/shm` is a → Linux/filesystem/links-between-files[symbolic link] to `→ Linux/fhs/run/shm`.

sa:

 The → development/tools/Docker commands `→ development/tools/Docker/commands/create` and `→ development/tools/Docker/commands/run` have the option `--shm-size` to set the size of `/dev/shm`.

 `→ Linux/fhs/run/shm`

 `→ Linux/fhs/dev`
