$ /dev/shm

`/dev/shm` can be used to share data between processes.

This directory is also (or only?) the place where *named semaphores* are created.


  Apparently, on some systems, `/dev/shm` is a → Linux/filesystem/links-between-files[symbolic link] to → Linux/fhs/run/shm.

sa:

  → Linux/fhs/run/shm

  → Linux/fhs/dev
