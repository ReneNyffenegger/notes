*tty* stands for *teletype*.

In each → Linux/kernel/process, `/dev/tty` is a synonym for the  controlling terminal that is associated with the process group of the current process.

`/dev/tty` is particularly useful to make sure that messages are written or read from that terminal, no matter how input or output is redirected.
