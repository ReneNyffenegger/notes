$ Oracle base directory

The *base directory* is the top directory into which all (that is more accurately: most) Oracle related files and directories are placed. Noteable exceptions are
→ Linux/fhs/etc/oratab, → Linux/fhs/etc/oraInst_loc

`/u01/app/oracle` might be the base directory for the → Linux/user `oracle` (Note that the last part of the directory path is identical to the user).


The Oracle base directory contains
  • → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n[Oracle home] directories
  • → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/oradata[`./oradata`] (database files)
  • `./diag` for diagnostic data
  • `./flash_recovery_area` (or `./recovery_area`?)
  • `./admin`
  • → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/tfa[`./tfa`] (if → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/trace-file-analyzer is installed)
