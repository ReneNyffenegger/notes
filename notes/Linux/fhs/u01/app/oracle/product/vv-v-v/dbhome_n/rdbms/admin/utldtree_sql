$ $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utldtree.sql

`utldtree.sql` creates object that can be used to show dependencies between → development/databases/Oracle/objects[objects].
-
The objects created are:
table { ll
  `deptree_fill` ☰ The procedure that collects dependency information.
  `deptree_temptab` ☰ The table that stores the collected dependency data.
  `deptree` ☰ A view that select from `deptree_temptab` (and, if created by `sys`, also from the → development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables[fixed tables] `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/dp`, `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/ob`, `→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/fixed-tables/k/g/l/xs` to show cursors that depend on the given object)
  `ideptree` ☰ A view that selects from `deptree` and shows the data somewhat more prettier.
  `deptree_seq` ☰ The sequence that provides the primary key values for `deptree_temptab`.
table }

Install the objects in → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus:

{ Misc

  This file was renamed from `utldeptree.sql` to `utldtree.sql` in 1992.

  The view `ideptree` has a `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/select/group-by` clause for which a comment states as reason *So user can omit sort-by when selecting from ideptree*.
