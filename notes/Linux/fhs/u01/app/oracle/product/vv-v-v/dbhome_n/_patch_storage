$ $ORACLE_HOME/.patch_storage/

`$ORACLE_HOME/.patch_storage` is used by → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/OPatch[OPatch] to back up patches in order to make rolling back a patch easier.

When a patch is applied, the inventory is changed and a snapshot of the inventory is stored it in `$ORACLE_HOME/.patch_storage/<patch-id_timestamp>`. This directory contains a `restore.sh` script which remove any changes that were made to the inventory after the application of the patch.
