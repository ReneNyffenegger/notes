`approot_to_pdb.sql` is the *app Root -> PDB conversion script*:
"
  When an App Root is plugged in or cloned into a regular PDB,
  certain dictionary bits need to be cleared. This is accomplished 
  as part of this script. If these dictionary bits are not cleared,
  certain views may not display correctly and certain parts of 
  Oracle code may not run properly.
