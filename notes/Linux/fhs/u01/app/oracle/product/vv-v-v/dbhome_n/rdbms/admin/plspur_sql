Package definition for the `sys.sys_stub_for_purity_analysis` → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL package.

The package only has a specification but no body.

As per a comment in the `plspur.sql` file, this pacakge is somehow related to *interop purity*.

The package specification has the following procedures:
  • `prds`
  • `pwds`
  • `prps`
  • `pwps`


Create a simple procedure:
code {
create or replace procedure tq84_dep_test as begin
   null;
end;
/
code }

procedure is not dependent on `sys_stub_for_purity_analysis`:
code {
select * from dba_dependencies
where
   referenced_owner = 'SYS'              and
   referenced_name  = 'SYS_STUB_FOR_PURITY_ANALYSIS'
and
   owner            =  user             and
   name             = 'TQ84_DEP_TEST';
code }

However, when adding a statement to the procedure (which as I assume is dependent on `sys_stub_for_purity_analysis`), the procedures (also?) becomes dependent on `sys_stub_for_purity_analysis`:
code {
create or replace procedure tq84_dep_test as begin
   dbms_output.put_line('xxx');
end;
/
code }
