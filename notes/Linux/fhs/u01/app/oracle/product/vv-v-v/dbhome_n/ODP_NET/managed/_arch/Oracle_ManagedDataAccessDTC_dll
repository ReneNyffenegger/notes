$ Oracle.ManagedDataAccessDTC.dll

`Oracle.ManagedDataAccessDTC.dll` includes the Oracle Services for MTS enlistment and commit
functionality and must be deployed with Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.dll for any
ODP.NET, Managed Driver applications using distributed transactions. It can
run alongside the unmanaged Oracle Services for MTS version if unmanaged data
access drivers, such as ODBC, are also using distributed transactions on the
same machine.

`Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.dll` is packaged with the → development/databases/Oracle/ODP_NET/drivers/managed[ODP.NET, Managed Driver].
