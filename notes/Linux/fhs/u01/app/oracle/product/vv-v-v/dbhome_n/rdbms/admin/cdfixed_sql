$ $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/cdfixed.sql

Create `V_$` views, `V$` synonyms for  → development/databases/Oracle/installed/dynamic-performance-views and *grant select* on the synonyms to
→ development/databases/Oracle/security/roles/oracle-maintained/select_catalog_role[`select_catalog_role`].

The script consists of a series of three statements for each(?) fixed view like so:
code {
create or replace view v_$database as select * from v$database;
create or replace public synonym v$database for v_$database;
grant select on v_$database to select_catalog_role;
code }

  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/cdbfixed_sql[`cdbfixed.sql`] which installes `CV$` views.
