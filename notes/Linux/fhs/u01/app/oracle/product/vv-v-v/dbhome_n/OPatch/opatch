$ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch
@ opatch

`opatch` is typically used to patch files located under the Oracle Home (such as binaries or timezone files) and needs therefore to be run while the instance is down.

This is in contrast to → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/OPatch/datapatch[`datapatch`] which patches data «inside» the database.

`$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch` is a shell or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe/batch-files[`.bat`] script.

  The current → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/patching/PSU[Patch Set Updates (PSU)] and interim patches can be determined like so
code {
$ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lsinventory
$ $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/opatch lsinventory | → Linux/shell/commands/grep[grep] 'Patch description'
code }

  Compare with the following SQL statement:
code {
select * from sys.registry$history;
code }

  The information that is available with `opatch lsinventory -xml` can also be queried using the
 `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/qopatch` package.
