`catjava.sql`: catalog scripts for → development/languages/Java


This script loads the java classes for RDBMS features; it
should be run after JAVA is loaded into the database (`→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/registry[dbms_registry].is_loaded('JAVAVM')`). The
CATNOJAV.SQL script should be used to remove these java 
classes prior to removing JAVA from the database.
