  { Command Line Variables Usage

    Command line variables are specified using `<name=value>;` for example:
code {
[ session: | compName: | compName:version: ]variableName=" valueOfVariable"]
code }

     Session/Installer variables are specified using: `[session:]varName=value`, for example:
       • `session:ORACLE_HOME_NAME="OraHome"`
       • `ORACLE_HOME_NAME="OraHome"`

      The lookup order is `session:varName` then just `varName`.
      -
      The session prefix is used to avoid ambiguity.

   Component variables are specified using `[compInternalName:[Version:]]varName`, for example:
      • `oracle.comp1:1.0.1:varName="VarValue"`
      • `oracle.comp1:varName="VarValue"`

    The lookup order is `compInternalName:Version:varName`, then `compInternalName:varName`, then just `varName`.

  }

{ TODO

  There is also a `setup.exe` directly under the installation root (`→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n`).
