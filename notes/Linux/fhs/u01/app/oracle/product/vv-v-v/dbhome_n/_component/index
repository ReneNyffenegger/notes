$ Component (directories) under $ORACLE_HOME

Some of the directories found under `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n` correspond to «components» (see `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/lib/facility_lis`).

{ mesg subdirectories #ora-home-mesg-dir

  Each(?) component maintains a `mesg` subdirectory which in turn store message files for *facilities*. These message files have the suffixes `.msg` if they're readable or `.msb` if they're compiled into a binary form.

  English readable message files can be found with
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/find → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n -name '*us.msg' | sort
code }

  The source code of `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin/oerr_pl` is quite helpful when trying to understand components, facilities and message files.
