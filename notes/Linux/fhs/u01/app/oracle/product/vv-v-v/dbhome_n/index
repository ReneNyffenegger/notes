$ $ORACLE_HOME

The *Oracle home* directory is the location where Oracle software/products are installed.

An → development/databases/Oracle home directory is installed under → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle[the Oracle base directory], for example in
`/u01/app/oracle/product/12.2.0/dbhome_1`.

{ Some subdirectories:

{ Executing SQL scripts below Oracle Home from SQL*Plus

  In → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus, when using the → development/databases/Oracle/SQL-Plus/start[`start`] command, the question mark is replaced with the path of Oracle Home. Thus, scripts that
  are found below Oracle Home can be executed like so:
code {
rene@ora19> @?/→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/utlsampl_sql[rdbms/admin/utlsqmpl]
code }

}
{ Directory name pattern

 `/mp/s/u/v/v/type_[n]`

  table { ll
    `mp` ☰ Mount point
    `s` ☰ a standard(?) directory name
    `u` ☰ Name of the directory's owner
    `v` ☰ Version number
    `type` ☰ type of installation (`dbhome`, `client` or `grid`)
    `_n` ☰ An optional counter
  table }

}
{ 21c: read only

  With → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c[Oracle 21c], the Oracle Home is read-only in order to separate installation and configuration and thus simplify provisioning.

  A consequence of read only Oracle Home is that ORACLE_BASE_HOME and ORACLE_BASE_CONFIG are located in a different location.
  -
  Directories affected include `network/admin`, `network/trace` and `network/log`

  See also the executables `orabasehome` and `orabaseconfig`.

}
{ demo directories

 `demo` directories contains examples and demonstrations. Most of these `demo` directories are not installed by default but must rather be installed with «Oracle Database Examples».

  Such `demo` directories include
    • `demo`
    • `jdbc/demo`
    • `odbc/demo`
    • `ord/http/demo`
    • `precom/demo`
    • `rdbms/demo`
    • `sqlj/demo`
    • `sqlplus/demo`
    • `/xdk/demo`

  Because in → development/databases/Oracle/Releases-and-versions/21c, the Oracle Home directory is read only, these `demo` directories should be copied to *ORACLE_BASE_HOME*.

}

{ TODO

  { setup.exe / setup.bat

    The (Windows) directory contains a → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/setup[`setup.exe`] and a `setup.bat` file.

    There is also a `setup.exe` under `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/oui/bin`.


  }
  { root.sh

    The → Linux installation contains a → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/root_sh[`root.sh`] file.

  }
  { inventory.xml #oracle-inventory-xml

    The `inventory.xml` file seems to keep track of all installed Oracle Homes.

    This file is stored in a directory named `ContentsXML`. On → Windows, the location of `ContentsXML`  is stored in the → Windows/registry
    under → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ORACLE[`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE`], value of `inst_loc`.
