$ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/rman

`→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/bin[$ORACLE_HOME/bin]/rman` is the → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN client.

{ Starting RMAN #rman-client-start

code {
$ rman
$ rman TARGET /
$ rman TARGET user@db
code }

  `rman TARGET /` uses OS authentication and implicitely connects with SYSDBA → development/databases/Oracle/security/privileges[privilege].
  -
  In order to (explicitly) connect with OS authentication and use a different privilege, this is possible with something like
code {
$ rman target '"/ as sysdba"'
$ rman target '"/ as sysbackup"'
code }

  In order to use password file authentication:
code {
$ rman target '"me@db as sysdba"'
code }

  Connecting to a → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/target-database without using a
  → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN/recovery-catalog:
code {
$ rman target / nocatalog
code }

}
{ Ending RMAN #rman-client-exit

code {
RMAN> EXIT
code}

Note: `exit` is equivalent to `quit`

}
{ Pipe interface #rman-client-pipe

  It is possible to send commands to `rman` with pipe-messages (→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/dbms/pipe[`dbms_pipe`]).

  The following command creates two pipes: `ORA$RMAN_PFEIFE_IN` and `ORA$RMAN_PFEIFE_OUT` which can be used by an RMAN client to communicate with RMAN:
code {
$ rman PIPE pfeife target /
code }

  Using `timeout n` forces `rman` to quit after `n` seconds if it doesn't receive any input from the specified pipe:
code {
$ rman PIPE pfeife target / timeout 60
code }

   After invoking `rman` in this fashion, it will print `RMAN-00572` messages when it is ready to receive messages from the pipe.

}
{ Checking syntax

  If rman is started with the `checksyntax` option, → development/databases/Oracle/tools/RMAN will only parse and check the commands, but not execute them. If it finds an error, it will notify the user with
  a *RMAN-00558: error encountered while parsing input commands* message.
code {
$ rman checksyntax
RMAN> …
code }

}
