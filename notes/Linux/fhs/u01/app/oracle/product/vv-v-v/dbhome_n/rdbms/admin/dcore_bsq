$ $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/dcore.bsq

`dcore.bsq` creates → development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/_bootstrap-tables[bootstrap tables] (such as `tab$` etc.) and other tables (such as `dual` etc…).

`dcore.bsq` is probably sourced/called from → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/sql_bsq[`sql.bsq`]

A comment in → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/rdbms/admin/doptim_bsq[`doptim.bsq`] suggests that `dcore.bsq` handles *pseudo-bootstrap* objects.

{ Creating OBJ$ #ora-create-obj

  Interestingly, `dcore.bsq` creates the table `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/data-dictionary/base-tables/obj`,
  but `obj$` stores the name of all objects that are created. In fact, `obj$` is the 18th object to be created (at least on Oracle 19c).
code {
select name from obj$ where obj# = 18;
code }

  This leaves one wondering how this and the previous records got written into `obj$`.

}

sa:

 `dcore.bsq` also creates the `→ development/databases/Oracle/SQL/dual` table.
