$ %ORACLE_HOME%\bin\orastack.exe

the `orastack` utility was created to allow users to modify
the amount of stack that's reserved and/or committed by
each thread in the oracle server.

By running `orastack` on certain → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[.exe] files, the headers of these executables are patched
to reflect the settings specified. Typically, changing the commit size of each → Windows/development/process/thread[thread's] stack is not necessary, since NT
will commit more stack as needed. However, decreasing each thread's reserved size may be necessary since this size comes
out of the Oracle Server's 2 gigabyte address space.

When thousands of connections or a large
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/instance/SGA are in use, running out of address space in the
→ development/databases/Oracle/architecture/processes/server[Oracle server process] [although still having available physical memory in the machine] is a possibility.
