$ ORACLE_HOME/bin/oerr

`oerr` can be used to translate an error code (of a facility) to a *cause* and a (hopefully) appropriate *action* for that that cause.

The facility is identified by the (always(?) three letter) string. For eample for `ORA-00600`, the facility is *ora* and the error number is 600.

code {
$ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/oerr ora 600
00600, 00000, "internal error code, arguments: [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s], [%s]"
// *Cause: This is the generic internal error number for Oracle program
//         exceptions. It indicates that a process has encountered a low-level,
//         unexpected condition. The first argument is the internal message 
//         number. This argument and the database version number are critical in
//         identifying the root cause and the potential impact to your system.
// 
// *Action: Visit My Oracle Support to access the ORA-00600 Lookup tool
//          (reference Note 600.1) for more information regarding the specific
//          ORA-00600 error encountered.
//
//          An Incident has been created for this error in the Automatic 
//          Diagnostic Repository (ADR). When logging a service request, use 
//          the Incident Packaging Service (IPS) from the Support Workbench
//          or the ADR Command Interpreter (ADRCI) to automatically package the
//          relevant trace information (reference My Oracle Support Note 411.1).
//
//          The following information should also be gathered to help determine 
//          the root cause:
//             - changes leading up to the error
//             - events or unusual circumstances leading up to the error
//             - operations attempted prior to the error
//             - conditions of the operating system and databases at the time 
//               of the error
//
//          Note: The cause of this message may manifest itself as different 
//          errors at different times. Be aware of the history of errors that 
//          occurred before this internal error.
