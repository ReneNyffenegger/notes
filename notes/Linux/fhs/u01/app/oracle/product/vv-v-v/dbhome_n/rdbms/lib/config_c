$ $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/lib/config.c

As per a comment in `$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/lib/config.c` defines the structure `ss_dba_grp` which defines the *group id* for SQL/dba administrative access (by default: `dba`, `oper`, `bakupdba`, `dgdba`, `kmdba` and `racdba`).
-
This structure seems to be related to the entries found in the password file (`→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/dbs/orapwORACLE_SID`).

As per a comment found in this source file, it needs to be in sync with `rdbms/src/server/osds/config.c`, specifically regarding the number of elemetns in the `ss_dba_grp` array.

If `confic.c` is modified, it can be compiled with
code {
$ make -f ins_rdbms.mk config.o
$ make -f ins_rdbms.mk ioracle
code }
