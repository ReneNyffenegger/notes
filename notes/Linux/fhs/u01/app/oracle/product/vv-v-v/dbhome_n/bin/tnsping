$ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/tnsping

`tnsping` tests if the listener specified in the Oracle Net alias is up or down.

`tnsping` responds with one of
  • `OK`
  • → development/databases/Oracle/errors/TNS-12541_TNS_no-listener
  • → development/databases/Oracle/errors/TNS-03505_Failed-to-resolve-name
 

When `tnsping` is invoked, it normally works as follows:
  • `tnsping` resolves the specified Oracle Net alias given on the command line
  • sends a *connect package* (NSPTCN) to the listener address
  • the listener responds with a *refuse packet* (NSPTRF)
  • tnsping displays the roundtrip time and result
