$ ORACLE_HOME/bin/wrap

`wrap` is an execuatable that can be used to *obfuscate* → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL code.

{ Unwrapping wrapped PL/SQL code

  After obfuscating such code, it can be deobfuscated («unrapped») again with, for example with the following Python script:
  gh|py-PL-SQL-unwrapper|/unwrap.py||

  This script was originally written by *Niels Teusink* as → development/languages/Python 2 script and published on
  → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/py-PL-SQL-unwrapper/blob/master/unwrap.py[github].
  -
  I modified this script to run with Python 3.
