$ orainstRoot.sh

The `orainstRoot.sh` script must be run as *root* as second last step of an Oracle installation.

This script is found in the *ora inventory* directory.

As far as I can tell, in a Linux environment, the following performed by this script
  • Copies → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oraInventory/oraInst_loc[`orainst.loc`] (found in the  → Linux/fhs/u01/app/oraInventory[ora intentory directory]) to `→ Linux/fhs/etc/oraInst_loc`.
  • Sets correct permissions for the ora inventory directory


code {
#  /u01/app/oraInventory/orainstRoot.sh
Changing permissions of /u01/app/oraInventory.
Adding read,write permissions for group.
Removing read,write,execute permissions for world.

Changing groupname of /u01/app/oraInventory to oinstall.
The execution of the script is complete.
code }

  After running the script, the newest file in `→ Linux/fhs/etc` is `oraInst.loc`:
code {
# → Linux/shell/commands/ls -lt /etc/ | → development/languages/sed -n 2p
-rw-r--r--  1 root root     56 Dec 27 15:43 oraInst.loc
code }

No differences:
code {
# → Linux/shell/commands/diff /u01/app/oraInventory/oraInst.loc /etc/oraInst.loc
code }

After running `orainstRoot.sh`, `→ Linux/fhs/u01/app/oracle/product/vv-v-v/dbhome_n/root_sh` must be run.
