$ /u01/app/oraInventory

The *Oracle Inventory directory* stores metadata about an Oracle installation (for example: log files).

Usually, this directory's group ownership belongs to the → development/databases/Oracle/adminstration/unix-users-and-groups#oracle-inventory-group[oracle inventory group]
→ Linux/group.

Apparently, the same file is also found in → Linux/fhs/etc/oraInst_loc
