$ Linux locale
@ locale

The → Linux/POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.


{ Defining the current locale


  → development/environment-variable#lang[`$LANG`] environment variable stores the locale, language and
  → development/Unicode/character-set.
  -
  The format of `$LANG` is `ll_TT.CCCC[@Modifiers]`. `ll` is a two letter abbreviation
  (→ misc/ISO/639[ISO 639]) of the language, `TT` a two letter abbreviation → misc/ISO/3166[ISA 3166] for the territory and
  `CCCC` the characters set. So, in order to define a locale for the german part of Switzerland, one might use
  -
  `export LANG=de_CH.UTF8`

  Other environment variables are:
  → development/environment-variable#lc-collate,
  → development/environment-variable#lc-ctype,
  → development/environment-variable#lc-messages,
  → development/environment-variable#lc-monetary,
  → development/environment-variable#lc-numeric,
  → development/environment-variable#lc-time,
  → development/environment-variable#nlspath
