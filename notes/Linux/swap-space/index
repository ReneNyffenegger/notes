$ Linux swap space
@ swap space

*Swap space* provides disk storage to which the kernel can move memory pages when available RAM memory becomes exhausted. Swap space is also needed to store the *entire contents of RAM* when hibernating a system.

{ Size and location of swap space

  There is no perfect size of swap space.
  -
  Generally, the size of swap space is recommended to be twice the amount of available RAM.

  Ideally, swap space should be allocated on SSDs rather than rotational disks.

  It should be taken into consideration to allocate a swap space on each
  available physical disk. This enables them to be utilized for parallel read
  and write operations.

? It seems that at least with BTRFS, swap space should be placed on a *subvolume* (→ https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Btrfs#Swap_file[see also here]).

}
{ Forms of swap space

  There are two forms of swap space:
    • swap partitions
    • → #linux-swap-files[swap files] (especially interesting for systems with limited disk space)

}
{ Displaying swap space

Swap usage can be displayed with
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/swapon -s
code }

This is equivalent to
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/cat → Linux/fhs/proc/swaps
code }

The reported size is measured in kilobytes.

}
{ Swappiness #swappiness

  The kernel parameter *swappiness* defines how quickly (seemingly) unused → Linux/memory gets swapped out.

  The parameter has a value between 0 and 100.
  -
  0 indicates that the memory should not be swapped out very quickly; 100 that it should get swapped out as soon as possible.
  -
  The default is 60.

  The value can be queried with
code {
cat → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/vm/swappiness
code }

  The value can be changed with
code {
echo 42 > → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/vm/swappiness
code }

  The value can be permanently changed in → Linux/fhs/etc/sysctl_conf.

}
{ Swap files #linux-swap-files

  The → Linux/kernel[Kernel] expects to be able to write to the swap file directly, without the assistance of the filesystem.
  -
  This is a problem on files with holes or on copy-on-write files on → Linux/filesystem/filesystems[filesystems] like Btrfs.

  Preallocated files created by `fallocate` may be interpreted as files with holes too depending of the filesystem.
  -
  Preallocated swap files are supported on XFS since Linux 4.18.

}

sa:
  → Linux/memory

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/mkswap` intializes a swap partition , `→ Linux/shell/commands/swapon` activates swap space.
