$ Linux swap space
@ swap space

*Swap space* provides disk storage to which the kernel can move memory pages when available RAM memory becomes exhausted.

There are two forms of swap space:
  • swap partitions
  • swap files

{ Displaying swap space

Swap usage can be displayed with
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/swapon -s
code }

This is equivalent to
code {
cat → Linux/fhs/proc/swaps
code }

The reported size is measured in kilobytes.

}
{ Swappiness #swappiness

  The kernel parameter *swappiness* defines how quickly (seemingly) unused → Linux/memory gets swapped out.

  The parameter has a value between 0 and 100.
  -
  0 indicates that the memory should not be swapped out very quickly; 100 that it should get swapped out as soon as possible.
  -
  The default is 60.

  The value can be queried with
code {
cat → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/vm/swappiness
code }

  The value can be changed with
code {
echo 42 > → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/vm/swappiness
code }

  The value can be permanently changed in → Linux/fhs/etc/sysctl_conf.

}
sa:
  → Linux/memory

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/mkswap` intializes a swap partition , `→ Linux/shell/commands/swapon` activates swap space.
