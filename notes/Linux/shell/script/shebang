A *shebang* allows to execute a non-binary file (i. e. a script) with a given interpreter.

The shebang is located in the script's first line and consists of  `#!` followed by the path (relative or absolute) to the interpreter
code {
#!/usr/bin/perl
…
code }

If the interpreter is not found, the error *bad interpreter: No such file or directory* is thrown.

{ Use interpreter whose absolute or relative path is not known

  Sometimes, the exact path to the interpreter is not known, for example when using a virtual environment such as `→ development/languages/Python/standard-library/venv` in Python.

  In such a case, `env` (whose location is known) to locate the interpeter:
code {
#!/usr/bin/env python
…
code }


}
{ #!/hint/bash

 `#!/hint/bash` is a phony shebang used to provide a hint to → development/editors[text editors] that the file content is using → Linux/shell/bash syntax, for example in
 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/makepkg_conf`.

}

sa:

   The execution of files with shebangs seem to be hanled by the Linux source file `→ Linux/kernel/source/fs/binfmt_script_c`.

  `pathfix.py`, located under the → development/languages/Python installation directory `→ development/languages/Python/installation/directory/Tools/scripts`, changes shebangs in Python scripts.
