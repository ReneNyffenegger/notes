$ Shell script
@ shell script

{ Check if at least n arguments are present

 `$#` stores the number of arguments that were given when executing a shell script. Thus, it's possible to
  check if at least a given number of arguments are present.

  The following fragment checks if at least 3 arguments were passed:
code {
if [ $# -lt 3 ]; then
    echo Error: At least 3 arguments are required.
    exit 1
fi

# … rest of the shell script …
code }

}
{ String comparison

  { Check if a string starts with a given string

code {
if [   abcdef =  abc  ];  then echo matched; else echo did not match; fi
if [   abcdef =  abc* ];  then echo matched; else echo did not match; fi
if [   abcdef == abc* ];  then echo matched; else echo did not match; fi
if [[  abcdef == abc* ]]; then echo matched; else echo did not match; fi    # matched
if [[  abcdef =  abc* ]]; then echo matched; else echo did not match; fi    # matched
if [[ xabcdef =  abc* ]]; then echo matched; else echo did not match; fi
code }

    Note, `[[` is not available in `→ Linux/fhs/bin/sh`, so the following construct is an alternative for checking if a string starts with a given string:
code {
case $var in
  "$prefix"*) echo The variable starts with the prefix.         ;;
  *)          echo The variable does not start with the prefix. ;;
esac
code }

  }

}
{ getopts

code {
while getopts fx:h OPTION; do

  case $OPTION in
    f)
       echo f was specfied
       ;;
    x)
       echo x was specified with value $OPTARG
       ;;
    h)
       echo $0 [-f] [-x value] [-h]
       ;;
    esac

done

echo OPTIND=$OPTIND
code }

code {
$ ./script
OPTIND=1

$ ./script -h
./script [-f] [-x value] [-h]
OPTIND=2

$ ./script -x
./script: option requires an argument -- x
OPTIND=2

$ ./script -x foo
x was specified with value foo
OPTIND=3

$ ./script -xbar
x was specified with value bar
OPTIND=2

$ ./script -f -x baz
f was specfied
x was specified with value baz
OPTIND=4
code }

  The value of `OPTIND` can be used to «shift away» the option arguments so that the required arguments can be processed:
code {
shift $((OPTIND-1))
code }

}
{ Determine directory where script is located

code {
dir="$(→ Linux/shell/commands/dirname "$(→ Linux/shell/commands/readlink -f "$0")")"
code }

}
{ Check if program/command/executable is present

code {
if command -v cmake &> → Linux/fhs/dev/null; then
    echo cmake was found
else
    echo cmake was not found
fi
code }
