  An *interactive* shell accepts input that is typed on a keyboard.

  a *non-interactive* shell executes commands that are stored in a file.

}
{ Login shells #login-shell

  A login shell can be changed with → Linux/shell/commands/chsh

  At least, in bash, if a shell is a login shell can be determined with `→ Linux/shell/bash/shopt[shopt] login_shell`.

  → Linux/fhs/etc/shells contains a list of allowed login shells on the system.
