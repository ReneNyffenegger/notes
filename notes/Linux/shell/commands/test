  { File and file descriptor tests

    The following operators test if the argument is a file with a special characteristic

    table { ll
     `-b` ☰ block special
     `-c` ☰ character special
     `-d` ☰ directory
     `-e` ☰ file exists
     `-f` ☰ regular file
     `-g` ☰ set-group-ID
     `-G` ☰ owned by the effective group ID
     `-h` ☰ symbolic link, same as `-L`
     `-k` ☰ has its sticky bit set
     `-L` ☰ symbolic link, same as `-h`
     `-N` ☰ has been modified since it was last read
     `-O` ☰ owned by the effective user ID
     `-p` ☰ named pipe
     `-r` ☰ read permission is granted
     `-s` ☰ has a size greater than zero
     `-S` ☰ is a socket
     `-t` ☰ Argument is an *integer* that represents an opened file descriptor on a terminal
     `-u` ☰ its set-user-ID bit is set
     `-w` ☰ write permission is granted
     `-x` ☰ execute (or search) permission is granted
    table }

    Except for `-h` and `-L`, all  file-related tests dereference symbolic links.
