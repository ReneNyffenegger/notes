$ Shell command: useradd
@ useradd

Create a new → Linux/user[user] or update default new user information.

It is a *low level utility*. Therefore, you might want to use → Linux/shell/commands/adduser.

code {
$ useradd -s /bin/bash -m  rene
code }

`-s` specifies the default shell for the new user. If not specified, it takes the value of `SHELL` variable in → Linux/fhs/etc/default/useradd.

`-m` creates the new user's → Linux/home-directory if it does not exist.

{ Adding a user to a group (for example sudo)

  → Linux/shell/commands/usermod can be used to add an already created user to an already created group:
code {
$ usermod -a -G sudo rene
code }

  Make sure that → Linux/fhs/etc/sudoers is configured to → Linux/fhs/etc/sudoers#allow-sudo-group[allow users in the sudo group] to execute sudo commands.

}
{ Populating the users home directory (-k)

  By default, the home directory of a new user is populated with the files from the `SKEL` variable in → Linux/fhs/etc/default/useradd (default: →Linux/fhs/etc/skel[/etc/skel/*]).

  This directory can be overwritten with `-k /path/to/directory`.

  In order to not create any files in the home directory, use `-k → Linux/fhs/dev/null`.

}
{ Not adding the user to the faillog and lastlog databases (-l) #l

  When -l is specified, the user is not added to the → Linux/fhs/var/log/faillog[faillog] and
  → Linux/fhs/var/log/lastlog[lastlog] databases.
  

}
{ Changing the users password

  After creating a user, the password for the user might be set with → Linux/shell/commands/passwd

  code {
useradd -m rene
passwd rene
  code }

}

sa:

  A user is removed/deleted with →Linux/shell/commands/userdel.

  → Linux/shell/commands/groupadd

  → Linux/shell/commands/passwd 

  → Linux/shell/commands/index[Shell commands]
