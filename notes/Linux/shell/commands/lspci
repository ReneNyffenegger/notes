$ lspci: list connected PCI devices
@ lspci

`lspci` is a Linux → Linux/shell[shell] command that lists all connected → hardware/PCI devices regardless whether the respective driver is installed or not.

In normal output, the first three hexadecimal numbers (seperated by a colon and a dot) specify the → hardware/device[device's] → hardware/PCI#pci-bdf[B/D/F] (Bus, Device, Function).

{ Show device tree

  With `-t`, the PCI devices are listed as a tree. By adding `-v` shows the device vendors and names as well:
code {
lspci -tv
code }

}
{ Showing kernel drivers etc.

  `lspci -k` shows the kernel driver that is being used to handle the respective PCI device.
