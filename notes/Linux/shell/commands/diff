$ Shell command: diff
@ diff

Compare files line by line.

{ Command line options

  Some interesting options, ihmo, include
    • `-y` (side by side)
    • `-Z` (ignore trailing whitespace)
    • `-q` (Report only if file differs) This is especially useful when used in conjunction with `-r`
    • `-Z` (ignores white space at the end of a line). This is useful if diffing files that have been saved in Unix and Windows becuase of their differing → development/line-break[end of line] bytes.
