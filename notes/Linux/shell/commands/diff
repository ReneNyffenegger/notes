$ Shell command: diff
@ diff

Compare files line by line.

{ Command line options

  Some interesting options, ihmo, include
    • `-y` (side by side)
    • `-Z` (ignore trailing whitespace)
    • `-q` (Report only if file differs) This is especially useful when used in conjunction with `-r`
    • `-Z` (ignores white space at the end of a line). This is useful if diffing files that have been saved in Unix and Windows because of their differing → development/line-break[end of line] bytes.

  { diff.exe on Windows

    Unfortunately, it seems there is no `diff.exe` on Windows, by default.

    However, when → development/version-control-systems/git is installed, there is also a `diff` whose path can be set in → Windows/PowerShell like so
code {
$env:path = "$( → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/path/split (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/where_exe git)[0])\..\usr\bin;$→ Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/env[env]:→ Windows/development/environment-variables/PATH[path]"
code }

    Because `diff` is also an → Windows/PowerShell/language/alias for `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/compare`, the `diff` → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE[executable] must
    be explicitely invoked with the `.exe` suffix. Thus, this alias should (probably) be deleted:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/remove alias:diff -force
code }

  }
