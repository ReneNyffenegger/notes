$ Shell command: mount
@ mount


{ Mounting ntfs,fvat etc devices

  It seems that `chmod` has no effect on ntfs or fvat devices except when they are mounted with the `umask` option:
code {
mount -o umask=000 /dev/sdb1 /media
code }

}

{ Determining on what device a directory is mounted #determine-mount-point

  `→Linux/shell/commands/df /media/rene/TOSHIBA/images` might print
code {
Filesystem      1K-blocks     Used  Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb1      1953410044 98704032 1854706012   6% /media/rene/TOSHIBA
code }
