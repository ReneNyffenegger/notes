$ Shell command: rsync
@ rsync

By default, `rsync` compares files only by their sizes and modification times.
-
In order to also compare the content using a checksum, the `-c` flag needs to be specified.

{ Syncing two directories

code {
rsync -av --delete  $SRC  $DEST
code }

 `-a` turns on archive mode (recursive copy and preserving certain attributes of the source).
  -
 `-v` turns on increased verbosity
  -
 `--delete` deletes files in `$DEST` that are not present in `$SRC`.
