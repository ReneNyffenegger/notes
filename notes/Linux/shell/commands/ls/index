$ Shell command: ls
@ ls

`ls` shows the contents of a directory and/or information about files in that directory.

{ Options

  table { llll

  `-a` ☰ `--all` ☰ ☰ By default, `ls` does not list files whose name that start with a dot (such as for example → Linux/fhs/home/username/_profile[`.profile`] etc). This flag causes such files to be included.
  `-A` ☰ `--almost -all` ☰ ☰ Like `-a` except that `.` (the current directory) and `..` are not listed.
  ☰ `--author` ☰ ☰ Used together with `-l` to print a file's author as well.

   ☰ `--block-size` ☰ `=SIZE` ☰ Used together with `-l`. `SIZE` is an integer followed by a unit. At least one of integer and the unit must be specified. Recognized units are powers of 1024: `K`, `M`, `G`, `T`, `P`, `E`, `Z`, `Y` or powers of 1000: `KB`, `MB`… . Binary prefixes are also recognized (`KiB` (=`K`), `MiB` (=`M`) etc.)

{ -l

  If the first character is `b`, `c`, `p` or `s` then it is a →Linux/device-file. (b = → Linux/devices#block-devices[block device], c = character device, p = pipe device, s = socket device). 

  If the permission bits are followed by a dot (`-rwxr-x-r-x.`), it indicates a file with a SELinux context.

  A small letter `s` indicates that both the executable *and* the setuid/setgid bit are set. A capital letter `S` indicates that the setuid/setgit bit is set but
  the corresponding (and probably needed) executable bit is missing.

  The following script creates a few files and directories whose name corresponds to their permission bits. It then uses `ls -l` to display the permission bits:
  gh|shell-commands|/ls/l_permission-bits||

}
{ Showing atime, ctime and mtime #ls-time

  `-l` shows a file's → Linux/filesystem/file-directory-metadata#fs-amt-time[mtime], `-lu` a file's *atime* and `-lc` a file's *ctime*.

  In the following example, a files *atime* and *mtime* are changed with → Linux/shell/commands/touch#touch-t[the `-t` option of `touch`] and then shown again with `ls -l…`.

  gh|shell-commands|/ls/time||

}
{ -i

  `-i` prints the inode (index) number of the file. This can be useful to
   → Linux/shell/commands/rm#rm-special-character[remove files with special characters].

}
{ -S - sort by size

  
  With `-S` (uppercase s), the files are sorted by size.

  The following command shows all mp3's in a directory with wide listing, the largest first:
code {
ls -lS *mp3
code }

}
{ LS_COLORS

  This is a script that can be sourced to assign some values to the environment variable `LS_COLORS` which is used to color the output of `ls` (with `--colors=auto` ?)

  gh|PostLinuxInstallation|/dot-files/ls_colors||

}
{ Show largest files in a directory #ls-largest-files

  The output of `ls` can be piped into `→ Linux/shell/commands/sort` in order to show a directory's largest files.
  -
  Because we want to sort numerically rather than alphabetically, we use the → Linux/shell/commands/sort#sort-n[`-n`] flag of `→ Linux/shell/commands/sort`

code {
ls -l | → Linux/shell/commands/sort -nrk 5 | → Linux/shell/commands/head
code }

  `-h` in `ls` reports file sizes in human readable format (for example `1.89G` or `815M`; `-h` in `sort` sorts by human readable numbers:
code {
ls -lh | → Linux/shell/commands/sort -hrk 5 | → Linux/shell/commands/head
code }

}

  → Linux/shell/commands/stat

  → Linux/shell/commands/dircolors (to set `$LS_COLORS`)
