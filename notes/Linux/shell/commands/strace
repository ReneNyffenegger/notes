$ Shell command: strace
@ strace

`strace` traces (intercepts) → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[system calls] and → Linux/kernel/process/signal[signals] of a specific programs.
Thus, it is a valuable debugging tool.
-
`strace` does not need the source code of the examined program.

{ Default output stream is STDERR

 `strace` writes to → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stderr] by default.
  
  If output should go to *stdout*, for example to pipe it into `→ Linux/shell/commands/grep`, the output can be → Linux/shell/bash/redirection[redirected] like so:
code {
$ strace … 2>&1 | grep …
code }

  It's also possible to write the output to a file whose name is specified with the `-o` command line option.

}

{ Security

  Which processes `strace` can attach to is controlled by the → Linux/kernel/kernel-parameters#kernel-yama-ptrace_scope kernel parameter.

  The value of this kernel parameter can be changed like so:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/sudo → Linux/shell/commands/sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
code }

}


sa:
  → Linux/shell/commands/index[Shell commands]

  → Linux/kernel/syscalls/ptrace[`ptrace`].
