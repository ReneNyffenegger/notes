$ Shell command: getent
@ getent

`getent` finds entries in name service switch libraries.

{ Find a user or group entry

  Find a user in the → development/security/password[password] file → Linux/fhs/etc/passwd
code {
getent passwd rene
code }


  Similary, an entry in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/group` can be found like so
code {
getent group sudo
code }

  Apparently, this also works with pam/nss and user/groups that are not in the standard `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files.
