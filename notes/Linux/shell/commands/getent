$ Shell command: getent
@ getent

`getent` finds entries in name service switch libraries.

{ Find a user or group entry

  Find a user in the → development/security/password[password] file `→ Linux/fhs/etc/passwd`.
code {
$ getent passwd rene
rene:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/rene:/bin/bash
code }

  The previous command returned the entire line of the `/etc/passwd` database.
  -
  In order to get a specific field, for example the → Linux/home-directory which is the sixth, the output of `getent` can be piped into `→ Linux/shell/commands/cut`:
code {
$ getent passwd rene | → Linux/shell/commands/cut -d: -f6
/home/rene
code }


  Similary, an entry in `→ Linux/fhs/etc/group` can be found like so
code {
getent group sudo
code }

  Apparently, this also works with pam/nss and user/groups that are not in the standard `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files.
