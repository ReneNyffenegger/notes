$ Shell command: pr
@ pr

`pr` paginates or columnates text files (originally for printing).

{ Print the content of two text files side by side #pr-mt

  If the content of `~/file-1.txt` is
code {
one
two
three
four
five
code }

  … and the content of `~/file-2.txt` is
code {
foo
bar
baz
code }

  … then the following command will print their content «side by side»:
code {
$ pr -mt ~/file-1.txt ~/file-2.txt
one                                 foo
two                                 bar
three                               baz
four
five
code }

  This behavior is *somewhat* similar to the result obtained with `→ Linux/shell/commands/paste` or
  with → development/databases/DuckDB#duckdb-positional-joins[positional joins] in → development/databases/DuckDB.

}
{ Print the output of two programs side by side #pr-process-substitition

  → Linux/shell/Process-substitution can be used to print the output of two programs side by side.
  -
  The following example prints file in `→ Linux/fhs/tmp` starting with `a` on the left side, files
  starting with `w` on the right side:
code {
$ pr -mt -w 100 <( → Linux/shell/commands/ls -1 /tmp/a* ) <( → Linux/shell/commands/ls -1 /tmp/w* )
code }

}
