$ Shell command: recode
@ recode

`recode` convertes text from one → development/Unicode/character-encoding to another. Unlike `→ Linux/shell/commands/iconv[iconv]`, it is able to do that inplace (on the original file).

{ Example

  The following command converts `my-file.txt` from UTF-8 to Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).

code {
recode utf8..ISO-8859-1 my-file.txt
code }

}

sa:

  → development/Unicode/character-encoding-known

  → Linux/shell/commands/index[Shell commands]
