$ Shell command: ps
@ ps

`ps` shows a snapshot of a set of → Linux/kernel/process[processes].
-
The default set of shown processes are those
  • having the same EUID as the `ps` process itself, *and*
  • associated with the same terminal as the invoker.

The processes that are included in the set of shown processes can be configured with the
  → #ps-simple-proc-sel[simple] and → #ps-list-proc-sel[list] process selection options.

{ Option types

  A confusing aspect of `ps` is that some command line options come
    • with a preceding dash (referred to as *Unix options*),
    • with two preceding dashes (referred to as *GNU long options*) and
    • without a preceding dash (referred to as *BSD options*).

  For example, `-f` specifies *full-format listing* while `f` prints the processes in an ASCII art process tree.

}
{ Shown columns

  By default, `ps` lists the four columns
  table { ll
  `PID` ☰ → Linux/kernel/process#linux-pid[process id]
  `TTY` ☰ terminal associated with the process
  `TIME` ☰ cumulative CPU time
  `CMD` ☰ command that started the process
  table }

code {
$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   5105 pts/3    00:00:00 bash
   5373 pts/3    00:00:00 ps
code }

  These four columns can be specified explicitly with
code {
$ ps -o pid,tty,time,cmd
    PID TT           TIME CMD
   5105 pts/3    00:00:00 -bash
   5374 pts/3    00:00:00 ps -o pid,tty,time,cmd
code }

  If a BSD style option is used, the output add process state (`stat=STAT`) and shows command argugments (`args=COMMAND`) instead of the executable name:
code {
$ ps t pts/3
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
   5105 pts/3    Ss     0:00 -bash
   5397 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps t pts/3
code }

  Some command line options allow → Linux/shell/commands/ps#ps-opt-output[to modify the columns] that are printed.

{ Options

  { Simple process selection #ps-simple-proc-sel

   table { ll

    `a` ☰ Lift the BSD-style «only yourself» restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like. The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other means. An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used together with the `x` option.
    `-A`, `-e` ☰ All processes.
    `-a` ☰ All processes except both session leaders and processes not associated with a terminal.
    `-d` ☰ All processes except session leaders.
    `--deselect`, `-N` ☰ Reverse selection
    `g` ☰ *Obsolete*, only useful in sunos4: really all processes, even session leaders.
    `T` ☰ All processes associated with *this* terminal (TTY). Identical to the `t` option without any argument.
    `r` ☰ Restrict the selection to only running processes.
    `x` ☰ Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like. The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of processes selected by other means. An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to list all processes when used together with the a option.

      `--group grplist` ☰ Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name, i.e. the group whose file access permissions are used by the process. See also the `-g` option.
      `-g sesorgrplist` ☰ Select by session (if all elements `sesorgrplist` are numeric) *or* by effective group name (if at least one element is textual). Compare with `-s` and `--group` options.
      `p pidlist`, `-p pidlist`, `--pid pidlist` ☰ Select by → Linux/kernel/process#linux-process-ps[process ID] (PID). `p` does print the `STAT` column and process arguments, `-p` and `--pid` do not print these. `ps p $procid` is equal(?) to `ps -$procid`.

      `-f` ☰ Do full-format listing. This option can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add additional columns. It also causes the command arguments to be printed. When used with `-L`, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will be added. See the `c` option, the → Linux/shell/commands/ps/format-specifiers[format keywords] `args` and/or `comm`.

Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g. with `-O` or `--sort`). When used as a formatting option, it is identical to `-O`, with the BSD personality.

    { User defined format (fmt)

     `fmt` (options `--format`, `-o` and `o`) is given a list of comma or blank-separted → Linux/shell/commands/ps/format-specifiers[format specifiers] to specify the columns to be shown. 

      The `PS_FORMAT` environment specifies a default format.

      Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (`ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE- WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm`).
      -
      Column width can be explicitly controlled:
code {
ps -o pid,wchan:42,cmd
code }

     Headers can be renamed:
code {
ps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command
code }

    The result of `ps -o pid=X,comm=Y` is apparently different on various systems, some recognize the comma as column separator, others take it as part of the column header.
    -
    Use multiple `-o` to disambiguate.

    If all columns are renamed to the empty string, no header will be shown:
code {
ps -o pid= -o comm=
code }

    }
  }
  { Output modifiers

    table { ll

     `c` ☰ Show the true command name (executable file rather than `argv` value), `args` → Linux/shell/commands/ps/format-specifiers[format keyword] becomes `comm`.
     `--cols n` ☰ Set screen width.
     `--columns n` ☰ Set screen width.
     `--cumulative` ☰ Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).
     `e` ☰ Show the environment after the command.
     `f` ☰ ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).
     `--forest` ☰ ASCII art process tree.
     `h` ☰ No header. (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality). The `h` option is problematic. Standard BSD ps uses this option to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux ps uses this option to totally disable the header. This version of ps follows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case it prints a header on each page of output. Regardless of the current personality, you can use the long options `--headers` and `--no-headers` to enable printing headers each page or disable headers entirely, respectively.
     `-H` ☰ Show process hierarchy (forest).
     `--headers` ☰ Repeat header lines, one per page of output.
     `k spec`, `--sort spec` ☰ Specify sorting order with a multi-letter → Linux/shell/commands/ps/format-specifiers. The syntax is `[+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,…]]`. Default is order in increasing order (number or lexicographically). For example: `ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid`
     `--lines n` ☰ Set screen height.
     `n` ☰ Force numeric output for `wchan` and `user` → Linux/shell/commands/ps/format-specifiers[format specifiers], including all types of UID and GID.
     `--no-headers` ☰ Print no header line at all. `--no-heading` is an alias for this option.
     `O order` ☰ Sorting order (overloaded). The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order. Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g. with `-O` or `--sort`).
     `--rows n` ☰ Set screen height.
     `S` ☰ Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes into their parent. This is useful for examining a system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work.
     `w` ☰ Wide output. Use this option twice for unlimited width.
     `-w` ☰ Wide output. Use this option twice for unlimited width.
     `--width n` ☰ Set screen width.

    table }

    The following example uses the output modifiers `e` to print the process' environment.
    -
    `-p $$` selects the current process.
    -
    `-o cmd` selects a minimal set of columns.
    -
    The output is piped into `→ Linux/shell/commands/tr ' ' '\n'` so that each environment variable's name and value is printed on a separated line:

  The `-e` option shows every process.

code {

  Using `-A` (apparently standing for *all*) is equivalent.

{ Select displayed column (-o)

  `ps` can be invoked with the `-o` option (*user defined format*) to specify which columns should be reported.

  Show Process ID (`pid`), Parent Process ID (`ppid`) and command with all its name (`arg`)
code {
ps -o pid,ppid,args
code }

  The (identical) BSD option of `-o` is `o`, the GNU long option is `--format`.

}
{ Change column width

  The width of the columns that were selected with `-o` can be changed with `:n`:

  The width of `cmd` is specified to be 40, the width of the user column to be 15:
code {
ps -e -o cmd:40,user:15,time
code }

  The width of the last column is not truncated even when specifying its width

}
{ cmd vs comm, changing the process name

  The following → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C[C program] changes the process name as reported with the column `cmd`.

  gh|shell-commands|/ps/change-command-name.c||

  When the program runs, it first asks to print the two columns `cmd` and `comm`.
  -
  After pressing a key, the program changes its programm name and asks again to print `cmd` and `comm`.

  It can be seen that the process name was changed.

}
{ Some columns

  `STAT`: the → Linux/kernel/process/states[process state]. An `s` indicates a *session leader*, a `+` that the process is part of a foreground process group. These attributes are
  related to job control (pressing Ctrl-Z or starting a process in the background `&`).
