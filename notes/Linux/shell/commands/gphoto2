$ Shell command: gphoto2
@ gphoto2

{ Showing available storages

code {
$ gphoto2 --storage-info
$ gphoto2 --storage-info | grep basedir
code }

}
{ Listing directories in a given folder

  The following command lists the subfolders in a given folder (for example `/store_00010001/DCIM`). The `-f` flag specifies the folder, the `-l` flag specifies to list the sub folders:

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM -l
code }

  In order to turn off the recursive listing, the `--no-recurse` flag can be applied.

  One might try to list the folders the root folder `/` in order to start down- or uploading files.

}
{ Listing files in a given folder #L

  This is almost the same as above, but with `-L` instead of `-l`.

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 -L
code }

  The listing prints an image's number and its name on a line. The numbers can be used to → #download-range[download a range] of images.

}
{ Downloading a specific file

  Downloading a specific file by its filename doesn't seem to be possible. The `--filename` names the files that are downloaded, not the files to be downloaded.

code {
gphoto2  -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 -p 42 --filename my-favorite.jpg
code }

}
{ Getting all files from a given folder

  The `-P` flag specifies that all files from a given folder are copied to the current working directory.

  `gphoto2` will ask if a file should be overwritten, if a file name is already present.

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 -P
code }

}
{ Getting a range of pictures #download-range

  The `-p` flag also allows to specify a range of images to download. The following command downloads images numbered 1490 through 1995.

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 -p 1490-1995
code }

  The image numbers can be found out by using the → #L[`-L`] flag.

}
{ Using the --new flag

  Apparently, `-P` (to get all files from a folder) can be combined with the `--new` flag so that only files will be retrieved that are not already downloaded.

}
{ Putting a file to the device

  The `-u` flag specifies the file which should be uploaded to the device:

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/Movies -u foo.mp4
code }

}
{ Deleting a file

A file to be deleted can be named with the `-d` flag:

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/Movies -d foo.mp4
code }
}
