$ Shell command: gphoto2
@ gphoto2

{ Listing directories in a given folder

  The following command lists the subfolders in a given folder (for example `/store_00010001/DCIM`). The `-f` flag specifies the folder, the `-l` flag specifies to list the sub folders:

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM -l
code }

}
{ Listing files in a given folder

  This is almost the same as above, but with `-L` instead of `-l`.

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 -L
code }

}
{ Downloading a specific file

  The `--filename` option allows to name a file to be downloaded from the camera.

code {
gphoto2  -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 --filename IMG_5292.JPG
code }

}
{ Getting all files from a given folder

  The `-P` flag specifies that all files from a given folder are copied to the current working directory.

  `gphoto2` will ask if a file should be overwritten, if a file name is already present.

code {
$ gphoto2 -f /store_00010001/DCIM/106___10 -P
code }

}
{ Using the --new flag

  Apparently, `-P` (to get all files from a folder) can be combined with the `--new` flag so that only files will be retrieved that are not already downloaded.
