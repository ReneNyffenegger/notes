$ Shell command: chmod
@ chmod

`chmod` changes the file mode bits.

A file's file mode bits determine who is able to read, write or execute a file.

{ Making a file read only

  Removing the `w` flag makes a file read only.

  The following command removes the `w` flag for everyone (`a` = all)
code {
chmod a-w readme.txt
code }

  The following command adds the `w` flag for the file's owner (`u` = user) so that at least the owner of the file can change it:
code {
chmod u+w readme.txt
code }

  The following command removes the `r` flag from others (`o`) so that the «rest of the world» cannot read the file:
code {
chmod o+w readme.txt
code }

}

{ Changing files to 644, directories to 755

  Uppercase X (`+X`) set the executable bit for directories only.
 
code {
chmod -R a=r,u+w,a+X /path/to/directory
code }


}
