$ Reduce file sizes on the shell with the gzip command
@ gzip

`gzip` compresses files so that their file size is smaller. Compressed files have the file → development/filename-extensions[suffix] `.gz`.

Usually, a set of files is first packed into a → Linux/shell/commands/tar[`tar`] → development/archive-files[archive] (with the file suffix `.tar`) and the gzip'ed, resulting in a
file with the suffix `.tar.gz` (sometimes, `tgz` is seen instead).
-
The alternative → Linux/shell/commands/zip[`zip`] utility does both in one step: it packages files and compresses them.

`gzip` uses the *Lempel-Ziv* (LZ77) coding.
