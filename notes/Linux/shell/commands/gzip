$ Linux shell command: gzip
@ gzip

`gzip` compresses files so that their file size is smaller. Compressed files have the file → development/filename-extensions[suffix] `.gz`.

Usually, a set of files is first packed into a → Linux/shell/commands/tar[`tar`] → development/archive-files[archive] (with the file suffix `.tar`) and the gzip'ed, resulting in a
file with the suffix `.tar.gz` (sometimes, `tgz` is seen instead).
-
The alternative → Linux/shell/commands/zip[`zip`] utility does both in one step: it packages files and compresses them.

`gzip` uses the *Lempel-Ziv* (LZ77) coding.

Supported compression methods:
  • deflate
  • compress
  • lzh (SCO compress -H)
  • pack.

  With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are those stored within the compress file if present.  With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all files is also displayed, unless some sizes are unknown. With --quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed.

{ Command line options

  table { lll

   `-a` ☰  `--ascii` ☰ Convert → development/line-break[end of lines] using local conventions, supported on non-Unix systems. In Windows environmment, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is converted to CR LF when decompressing.
   `-c` ☰  `--stdout`, `--to-stdout` ☰  Output to → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdout].
   `-d` ☰  `--decompress`, `--uncompress` ☰ Decompress
   `-f` ☰  `--force` ☰
   `-h` ☰  `--help` ☰
   `-l` ☰  `--list` ☰  When compressing: print compressed size, compression ratio and name of the uncompressed file. With `--verbose`, it also prints comppression method, crc, time stamp of uncompressed data.
   `-L` ☰  `--license` ☰ Display the gzip license and quit.
   `-n` ☰  `--no-name` ☰ When compressing, do not save the original file name and time stamp by default. When decompressing, do not restore the original file name and time stamp. *Default option when decompressing*.
   `-N` ☰  `--name` ☰ When compressing, also store the original file name and time stamp. When decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp (if present). *Default option when compressing*.
   `-q` ☰  `--quiet` ☰ Suppress all warnings.
   `-r` ☰  `--recursive` ☰
   `-S` ☰ `--suffix` ☰ Add specified suffix instead of `.gz.` when compressing. `.z` and `.gz` (?) should be avoided to avoid confusion when files are transferred to other systems.
   `-t` ☰  `--test` ☰  Check the compressed file integrity.
   `-v` ☰  `--verbose` ☰ Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed or decompressed.
   `-V` ☰  `--version` ☰ Display the version number and compilation options then quit.
   `-#` ☰  `--fast`, `--best` ☰  `#` = 1…9 (1 = fastests, 9 = best), defualt = `-6`

  In Oracle, a byte stream that is compatible to `gzip -n` can be produced with `→ development/databases/Oracle/installed/packages/utl/compress`.
