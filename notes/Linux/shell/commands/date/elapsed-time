$ Shell: Calculate and/or display elapsed time

`→ Linux/shell/commands/date → Linux/shell/commands/date#shell-date-unix-time[+%s]` returns the → development/date-time/Unix-time, that is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1st 1970. This
allows to calculate the number of elapsed seconds in a shell script in combination with `→ Linux/shell/commands/expr`:
code {
T0=$( → Linux/shell/commands/date → Linux/shell/commands/date#shell-date-unix-time[+%s] )

# do stuff (or take a nap):
sleep 10

echo time elapsed: $( → Linux/shell/commands/expr $( → Linux/shell/commands/date → Linux/shell/commands/date#shell-date-unix-time[+%s] ) - $T0 )
code }
