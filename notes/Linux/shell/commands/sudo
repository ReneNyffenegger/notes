$ Shell command: sudo
@ sudo

`sudo` executes a command as anonther user, called the *target user* which typically is → Linux/user/root.

Becoming → Linux/root: `sudo -i`.

{ Run a command as a specific user

  In order to run a command as a different user than the target user, the `-u` flag must be specified:
code {
sudo -u fred → Linux/shell/commands/ls ~fred
code }

}
{ Print alowed/forbidden commands

What am I allowed to do?
code {
sudo -l
code }

Together with `-U username`, `-l` queries another → Linux/user[user's] permissions. To use `-U`, the `ALL` privilege is needed (or being → Linux/user/root).
code {
sudo -l -U fred
code }

}
{ Not entering passwords

  In order for the → Linux/user[user] fred not to have to enter a password when executing `sudo`, the following line can be added to the → Linux/fhs/etc/sudoers[sudoers] file:
code {
fred ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
code }

  Alternatively, a user can create a little shell script that echoes his password:
code {
#/bin/sh
→ Linux/shell/bash/built-in/echo SecretGarden:w
code }

  He then has to store the path to this shell script in the → development/environment-variable[environment variable] `SUDO_ASKPASS`:
code {
export SUDO_ASKPASS=~/bin/password
code }

When he then executes sudo with the `-A` option, sudo will execute the shell script and take the password from this shell script:
code {
sudo -A do-something.sh
code }


}
{ Sessions

  A sudo session might be recorded and then later replayed with → Linux/shell/commands/sudoreplay

}

  → Linux/shell/commands/index[Shell commands]

  → Linux/fhs/var/log/sudo-io
