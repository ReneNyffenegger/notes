$ Shell command: sudo
@ sudo

`sudo` executes a command as anonther user, called the *target user* which typically is → Linux/user/root.

Becoming → Linux/root: `sudo -i`.

{ Run a command as a specific user

  In order to run a command as a different user than the target user, the `-u` flag must be specified:
code {
sudo -u fred → Linux/shell/commands/ls ~fred
code }

}
{ Print alowed/forbidden commands

What am I allowed to do?
code {
sudo -l
code }

Together with `-U username`, `-l` queries another → Linux/user[user's] permissions. To use `-U`, the `ALL` privilege is needed (or being → Linux/user/root).
code {
sudo -l -U fred
code }

}
{ Sessions

  A sudo session might be recorded and then later replayed with → Linux/shell/commands/sudoreplay

}
