$ Shell command: systemctl
@ systemctl

`systemctl` controls the → Linux/init/systemd system and service manager.

{ name.service files #name-service-files

  `systemctl` reads `name.service` files. These files define how and when services (→ Linux/daemons) should be started.

  These service files are located in → Linux/fhs/usr/lib/systemd/system. (Possibly also in `/run/systemd/system ` or `/etc/systemd/system`).

}
{ Enabling a service

code {
systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
code }

  Note, a service (unit?) can be enabled without being started, or it can be started without being enabled.

}
{ Starting a service

code {
systemctl start avahi-daemon.service
code }

}
{ Showing the status

  Without arguments, `systemctl status` shows the *system status*.
