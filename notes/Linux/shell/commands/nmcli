$ Shell command: nmcli
@ nmcli

`nmcli` is a command-line tool for controlling the → Linux/networking/NetworkManager.

{ Connect to a new WiFi Hotspot

  Show SSIDs
code {
nmcli d wifi list
code }

  Connect to the → development/networking/WLAN#wifi[WiFi] hotspot/SSID. The following command prompts the user to enter the password in a dialog:
code {
nmcli d wifi connect <ssid>
code }

  The password can also be stated non-interactively (note the keyword `password`):
code {
nmcli d wifi connect <ssid> password <password>
code }

}
{ Find available devices #nmcli-d-status

code {
nmcli device status
code }

  `device` and `d` are synonymous.

}
{ Installing in Debian/APT

 `nmcli` is contained in the package *network-manager*. 

}
{ Open a hotspot

  In order ot create a hotspot, the wifi adapter should support AP (=access point) mode.
  -
  If this is the case can be verified with
code {
sudo iw list | grep -A 10 'Supported interface modes'
code }

  Create the hotspot (unfortunately, I was unable to connect to the hotspot created with the following command):
code {
sudo nmcli device wifi hotspot con-name tq84-hotspot ssid tq84-ssid band bg password tq84-password
code }

  Show the hotspots' password (both as ASCII text and as QR code):
code {
nmcli dev wifi show-password
code }

  Remove the hotspot:
code {
sudo nmcli connection delete tq84-hotspot
code }

  Trying to create a hotspot like outlined in → https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/310699[this stackexchange answer] seemed to have more success (after I modified the `802-11-wireless-security.pmf` parameter to `1`).
  -
  Find the device name (in my case `wlp111s0`:
code {
  nmcli device
code }

  Then set up the hotspot:
code {
# sudo nmcli connection add type wifi ifname wlp111s0    con-name tq84-hotspot    autoconnect no  ssid tq84-ssid
  sudo nmcli connection add type wifi ifname wlp111s0    con-name tq84-hotspot    autoconnect yes ssid tq84-ssid
  sudo nmcli connection modify tq84-hotspot 802-11-wireless.mode ap 802-11-wireless.band bg ipv4.method shared
  sudo nmcli connection modify tq84-hotspot wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk
  sudo nmcli connection modify tq84-hotspot wifi-sec.psk tq84password
  sudo nmcli connection modify tq84-hotspot 802-11-wireless-security.pmf 1
  sudo nmcli connection up tq84-hotspot
code }

}
