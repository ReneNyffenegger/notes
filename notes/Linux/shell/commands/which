$ Shell command: which
@ which

`which XYZ` searches the directories that are listed in the `$PATH` environment variable for an executable or script named `XYZ` and, if found, prints the path to the executable or script:
code {
$ which which
→ Linux/fhs/usr/bin/[/usr/bin/]which
code }

If an executable or script is not found, `which` prints nothing.

If there are multiple executable or scripts, `which` only prints the first one found.

`which ${progname}` is equivalent to `→ Linux/shell/commands/type -P ${progname}`.

sa:
  → Linux/shell/commands[Shell commands]

  → development/languages/Perl/modules/_scripts_/whichpm[`whichpm`]: a cross-platform script that locates installed → development/languages/Perl/modules[Perl modules] by their package name.

  The Windows executable `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/where_exe` and the PowerShell command `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/get`.
