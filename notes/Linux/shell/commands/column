$ Shell command: column
@ column

`column` creates visually appealing tables. By default, every line is interpreted as a cell for the table.

The `-c` option determines the widht of the created table (c stands for console columns, not for table columns).

Here's an example with the following simple file:

gh|shell-commands|/column/testfiles/numbers.txt||

The following command
gh|shell-commands|/column/c_display-width_40||
turns the file into
code {
one          eleven
two          twelve
three        thirteen
four         fourteen
five         fivteen
six          sixteen
seven        seventeen
eight        eighteen
nine         nineteen
ten          twenty
code }

With `-c 60` I can specify the output to be wider:
gh|shell-commands|/column/c_display-width_40||
code {
one          eight           fivteen
two          nine            sixteen
three        ten             seventeen
four         eleven          eighteen
five         twelve          nineteen
six          thirteen        twenty
seven        fourteen
code }

Unfortunately, the output is seperated by tabs, not by whitespaces!
