$ Shell command: rm
@ rm

`rm` removes (aka unlinks) files or directories (`-r` needs to be specified for the latter).

{ Options

  table { llll

  `-f` ☰ `--force` ☰ ☰ ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
  `-i` ☰ ☰ ☰ prompt before every removal
  `-I` ☰ ☰ ☰ prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes
   ☰ `--interactive` ☰ `[=WHEN]` ☰ prompt according to `WHEN`: `never`, `once` (`-I`) or `always` (`-i`). Without `WHEN`: prompt always
   ☰ `--one-file-system` ☰ ☰ when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument
   ­☰ `--no-preserve-root` ☰ ☰ do not treat `/` specially
   ☰ `--preserve-root` ☰ `[=all]` ☰ do not remove `/` (default). With `all`: reject any command line argument on a separate device from its parent
  `-r`, `-R` ☰ `--recursive` ☰ ☰ remove directories and their contents recursively
  `-d` ☰ `--dir` ☰ ☰ remove empty directories
  `-v` ☰ `--verbose` ☰ ☰ explain what is being done
   ☰ `--help` ☰ ☰

{ Removing files with special, cryptic or strange characters #rm-special-character

  Determine inode number of file with `-i` option of → Linux/shell/commands/ls[`ls`]:
code {
$ ls -li
code }

  Then use the → Linux/shell/commands/find#find-inum[`-inum`] option of `→ Linux/shell/commands/find`. Since the file is in the current
  directory, `-maxdepth` can be set to 1:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/find -maxdepth 1 -inum FOUND-INUM -exec rm {} +
code }

}
{ Removing sensitive data

  Because `rm` only removes the connection of a filename from an inode and the file's data is marked as free for the filesystem, it's relatively simple to undelete or recover the deleted data until the data is overwritten.
  Therefore, `rm` cannot be considered safe to delete sensitive data.

  A somewhat more secure way to erase sensitive data is to use the `shred` command - however, this is not necessarily true anymore on solid state disks (SSD), see the stackexchange question → https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/593181/is-shred-bad-for-erasing-ssds[Is shred bad for erasing SSDs?].

{ Misc

  Contrary to an → https://twitter.com/kmcquade3/status/1570553560479453185[assertion in a tweet], the following command *does not* remove the french language pack :)
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/sudo rm -fr ./*
code }
