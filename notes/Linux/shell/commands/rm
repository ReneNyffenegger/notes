$ Shell command: rm
@ rm

{ Removing files with special, cryptic or strange characters #rm-special-character

  Determine inode number of file with `-i` option of → Linux/shell/commands/ls[`ls`]:
code {
ls -li
code }

  Then use the `-inum` option of → Linux/shell/commands/find[`find`]. Since the file is in the current
  directory, `-maxdepth` can be set to 1:
code {
find -maxdepth 1 -inum FOUND-INUM -exec rm {} +
code }

}
{ Removing sensitive data

  Because `rm` only removes the connection of a filename from an inode and the file's data is marked as free for the filesystem, it's relatively simple to undelete or recover the deleted data until the data is overwritten.
  Therefore, `rm` cannot be considered safe to delete sensitive data.

  A somewhat more secure way to erase sensitive data is to use the `shred` command - however, this is not necessarily true anymore on solid state disks (SSD), see the stackexchange question → https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/593181/is-shred-bad-for-erasing-ssds[Is shred bad for erasing SSDs?].
