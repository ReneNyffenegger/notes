{ Some extracts from man resize2fs

*The resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of hardware/harddisk/partition[partitions].*

*If you wish to enlarge a â†’ Linux/filesystem/filesystems, you must make sure you can expand the size of the underlying partition first.  This can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting  the  partition  and  recreating  it  with  a larger size or using lvextend(8), if you're using the logical volume manager lvm(8).  When recreating the partition, make sure you create it with the same starting disk cylinder as before!*

*If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use resize2fs to shrink the size of filesystem.  Then you may use fdisk(8) to shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size of the partition, make sure you do not make it  smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!*
