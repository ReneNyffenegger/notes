$ Shell command: tar
@ tar

`tar` is an archiving utility: it takes a set of files and creates *one* file of it.

Often, tar is used in combination with → Linux/shell/commands/gzip[`gzip`] so that the tarred file can be reduced in size (the resulting file is then a `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` file).

A peculiarity of the `tar` command is that it doesn't introduce command line options with a hyphen or dash.

{ Example

  The following example
    • creates a tar file, then
    • updates files within the tar file, then 
    • lists the file names within the tar file, then
    • extracts a file from the tar file, then
    • updates a file within the tar file again, then
    • deletes a file within the tar file, then
    • extracts the tar file's entire content to a different directory.
