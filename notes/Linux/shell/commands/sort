$ Shell command: sort
@ sort

`sort` sorts lines of text files.

`sort` is especially useful in conjunction with → Linux/shell/commands/uniq[`uniq`] (because `uniq` needs the input lines to be sorted).
-
However, the traditional sequence `sort | uniq` can nowadays usually be abbreviavated with `sort -u`

{ In place sorting

  The `-o` flag specifies an output file name for the sorted file.
  -
  If the specified file name is equal to the sorted file, this file will then
  have the sorted content.
