$ Shell command: ld
@ ld

The → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/linker[standard linker] is part of → development/GNU/toolchain/binutils, but not of the
→ development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC[GNU compiler collection]. This is why `ld` is installed under → Linux/fhs/usr/bin and not in the GCC bin path.
-
Also, GCC does not directly call `ld`, it calls `collect2`.

`ld` is not to be confused with the → development/dynamic-linker.
