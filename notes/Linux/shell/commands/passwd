$ Shell command: passwd
@ passwd


Change a → Linux/user[user's] → development/security/password[password]:
code {
$ passwd mySecretPassword
code }

Root can change another user's password:
code {
# echo 'mySecretPassword
mySecretPassword
' | passwd rene
code }

In order to change passwords in shell scripts or batch mode, `→ Linux/shell/commands/chpasswd` should be used.

{ Options

  table { llll

   `-a` ☰ `--all` ☰ ☰ Shows status for all users, can only be used with `-S`
   `-d` ☰ `--delete` ☰ ☰ Delete (empty) a user's password.
   `-e` ☰ `--expire` ☰ ☰ Immediately expire an account's password - user needs to change the password at next login.
   `-h` ☰ `--help` ☰ ☰
   `-i` ☰ `--inactive` ☰ `INACTIVE` ☰ This option is used to disable an account after the password has been expired for a number of days. After a user account has had an expired password for INACTIVE days, the user may no longer sign on to the account.
   `-k` ☰ `--keep-tokens` ☰ ☰  Indicate password change should be performed only for expired authentication tokens (passwords). The user wishes to keep their non-expired tokens as before.
   `-l` ☰ `--lock` ☰ ☰ Lock the password by prepending a `!` to its encrypted value so that effectively no password fits the encrypted password - does not disable the account as the user may still be able to login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key). To disable the account, administrators should use `usermod --expiredate 1`. Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their password. See also `-u`
   `-n` ☰ `--mindays` ☰ `MIN_DAYS` ☰ Set the minimum number of days between password changes to `MIN_DAYS`. A value of zero indicates that the user can always change the password.
   `-q` ☰ `--quiet` ☰ ☰
   `-r` ☰ `--repository` ☰ `REPOSITORY` ☰ change password in `REPOSITORY` repository
   `-R` ☰ `--root` ☰ `CHROOT_DIR` ☰ Apply changes in the `CHROOT_DIR` directory and use the configuration files from the `CHROOT_DIR` directory. (Only absolute paths are supported)
   `-P` ☰ `--prefix` ☰ `PREFIX_DIR` ☰ Apply changes to configuration files under the root filesystem found under the directory PREFIX_DIR. This option does not chroot and is intended for preparing a cross-compilation target. Some limitations: NIS and LDAP users/groups are not verified. PAM authentication is using the host files. No SELINUX support.
   `-S` ☰ `--status` ☰ ☰ Display account status information. 1) Loginname, 2)   `L` = Locked, `NP` = no password , `P` has password, 3) date of last change, 4) minimum age, 5) maximum age, 6) warning period, 7) inactivity period (last four values expressed in days)
   `-u` ☰ `--unlock` ☰ ☰ Unlock the password of the named account to value used before using `-l`.
   `-w` ☰ `--warndays` ☰ `WARN_DAYS` ☰  Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required.
   `-x` ☰ `--maxdays` ☰ `MAX_DAYS` ☰ Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid. After `MAX_DAYS`, the password is required to be changed. Passing the number -1 as `MAX_DAYS` will remove checking a password's validity.
   `-s` ☰ `--stdin` ☰ ☰  This option is used to indicate that `passwd` should read the new password from → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdin] (which can be a pipe).
