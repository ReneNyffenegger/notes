$ Shell command: [
@ [

`[` is a regular executable (`/usr/bin/[`).

`[ xxx ]` is equivalent to `→Linux/shell/commands/test xxx`.

`[` can can be used, for example, in an → Linux/shell/bash/if[if] statement.

{ [[ … ]] vs [ … ]

  In → Linux/shell/bash[bash], `[[` is a built-in.

  Because `[[` is a built-in, it allows to compare strings with `<` and `>`.
  With `[ … ]`, `<` and `>` would be treated as file redirectors, hence a file would be (over-)written or tried to read from a file.
