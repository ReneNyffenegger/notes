@ umount

`umount` unmounts mounted → Linux/filesystem[file systems]

{ target is busy

  Identify the → Linux/kernel/process that uses the mounted file system:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/fuser -amuv → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[/dev/sdb2]
code }

  Apparently, → Linux/shell/commands/lsof might help to identify such processes, too.
