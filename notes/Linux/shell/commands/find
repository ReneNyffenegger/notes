{ Find files case insensitively

Use the `-iname` argument:
code {
$ find . -iname '*foo*'
code }

}

{ Find files that were changed during the last 5 minutes

code {
$ find . -cmin -5
code }
Note the minus in front of the five: this finds files changed between 0 and 5 minutes. with `-cmin 5` only files changed *exactly* five minutes ago would be found.
`-cmin +5` find files changed earlier than five minuts ago.

→ development/GNU[GNU] understands date reference strings that can be given to `→ Linux/shell/commands/date#d[date -d]`.
code {
$ find . -newermt '5 minutes ago'
code }

}
{ Find files that were changed during the last n days

Similarly, files that were changed during the last week can be found so
code {
$ find . -ctime -7
code }

}
