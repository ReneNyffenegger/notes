$ Shell command: blockdev
@ blockdev

`blockdev` allows to call → Linux/devices#block-devices[block device] → Linux/kernel/syscalls/ioctl[ioctls].

code {
blockdev [-q] [-v] command [command...] device [device...]
blockdev --report [device...]
blockdev -h|-V
code }

It is possible to give multiple devices and multiple commands.

{ Options

  table { ll
    `-q` ☰ Be quiet.
    `-v` ☰ Be verbose.
    `--report` ☰ Print a report for the specified device. It is possible to give multiple devices. If none is given, all devices which appear in `→ Linux/fhs/proc/partitions` are shown. Note that the partition `StartSec` is in 512-byte sectors.
    `-h`, `--help` ☰ Display help text and exit.
    `-V`, `--version` ☰ Print version and exit.
  table }

}
{ Commands

  table { ll

    `--flushbufs` ☰ Flush buffers.
    `--getalignoff` ☰ Get alignment offset.
    `--getbsz` ☰ Print blocksize in bytes.  This size does not describe device topology.  It's size used internally by kernel and it maybe modified (for example) by filesystem driver on mount.
    `--getdiscardzeroes` ☰ Get discard zeroes support status.
    `--getfra` ☰ Get filesystem readahead in 512-byte sectors.
    `--getiomin` ☰ Get minimum I/O size.
    `--getioopt` ☰ Get optimal I/O size.
    `--getmaxsect` ☰ Get max sectors per request
    `--getpbsz` ☰ Get physical block (sector) size.
    `--getra` ☰ Print readahead (in 512-byte sectors).
    `--getro` ☰ Get read-only. Print 1 if the device is read-only, 0 otherwise.
    `--getsize64` ☰ Print device size in bytes.
    `--getsize` ☰ Print device size (32-bit!) in sectors. Deprecated in favor of the `--getsz` option.
    `--getss` ☰ Print logical sector size in bytes – usually 512.
    `--getsz` ☰ Get size in 512-byte sectors.
    `--rereadpt` ☰ Reread partition table
    `--setbsz bytes` ☰ Set blocksize. Note that the block size is specific to the current file descriptor opening the block device, so the change of block size only persists for as long as blockdev has the device open, and is lost once blockdev exits.
    `--setfra sectors` ☰ Set filesystem readahead
    `--setra sectors` ☰ Set readahead (in 512-byte sectors).
    `--setro` ☰ Set read-only. The currently active access to the device may not be affected by the change. For example filesystem already mounted in read-write mode will not be affected. The change applies after remount.
    `--setrw` ☰ Set read-write.
