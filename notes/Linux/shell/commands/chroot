$ Shell command: chroot
@ chroot

`chroot` is a way to change a process' top directory to another directory than the → Linux/fhs/root-directory.

Apparently, only → Linux/user/root can execute `chroot`, other users get a *cannot change root directory to …: Operation not permitted* error message.

sa:

 `systemd-nspawn` runs a command or OS in a leight-weight namespace container and is therefore somewhat similar to `chroot` but more powerful because it fully virtualizes the file system hierarchy, process tree, IPC subsystems and host and domain name.
