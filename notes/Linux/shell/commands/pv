$ Shell command: pv
@ pv

`pv` (pipe viewer) displays the progress of data flowing through a pipeline

`pv` needs to be inserted between two commands in a pipeline. It will then read → development/stdin-stdout-stderr[stdin] and pass it to its stdout while shoing progress information on standard error.

Display progress of a file being gunzipped:
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/zcat boot.img.gz | pv > boot.img
code }

Measure how fast data can be read from `→ Linux/fhs/dev/zero` and written to `→ Linux/fhs/dev/null`:
code {
$ pv → Linux/fhs/dev/zero > → Linux/fhs/dev/null
code }

sa:
  → Linux/shell/commands/index[Shell commands]
