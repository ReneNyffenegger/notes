$ Shell command: grep
@ grep

{ Recursive grep

  Only search `*.txt` files:
code {
grep -R --include=*.txt search-pattern
code }

}
{ Binary file ... matches

  Apparently, `grep` considers a file with a `NUL` character a binary file and won't by default print matched text for such files.

  In order to still print matches, one can use `-a` or the equivalent `--text` or still `--binary=text`.
