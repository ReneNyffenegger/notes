$ Shell command grep: find lines that match a regular expression
@ grep

In its basic use, `grep` prints lines of a text file that match a basic → development/regular-expressions[regular expression].

{ Recursive grep

  Only search `*.txt` files:
code {
grep -R --include=*.txt search-pattern
code }

}
{ -P #grep-P

  With the `-P` flag, the pattern is interpreted as a
  → development/languages/Perl/regular-expressions[Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE)].

  The default is to interpret is as *basic regular expression* (BRE).

  For example, to match a digit with BRE, you'd use `[0-9]`, with pcre, `[0-9]` as well as `\d` is possible.
  -
  To match three consecutive numbers, the curly braces must be escaped with backslashes: `[0-9]\{3\}`. With pcre, they don't: `\d{3}`.


}
{ Print matched part, not entire line

  With `-o` (or `--only-matching`), only the matched part of a line is printed (as opposed to the entire line that contains the matched text).

  If the mattern matches multiple times per line, each match is printed

  So, the following prints the words in a (text-)file:

code {
grep -oP '\w+' file.txt
code }

}
{ Print lines around matched line

  `-An` prints the matched line and the `n` lines following it.

  `-Bn` prints the matched line and the `n` lines preceeding it.

  `-cn` prints the matched line and the `n` lines preceeding and following it.


}
{ Searching multiple patterns at once

code {
$ grep -e PatternOne -e PatternTwo -e PatternThree file
code }

Find lines that match any of `PatternOne`, `PatternTwo` or `PatternThree`.

}
{ Searching for hexadecimal values

With → Linux/shell/bash/quoting/index#bash-ansi-c-quoting[ansi c quoting] (`$'...'`), it is possible to search for hexadecimal values. This is not a feature
of grep, but of the shell from which it is invoked.

The following example searches the → development/Unicode/UTF-8[utf 8] representation of `é`:

code {
$ grep $'\xc3\xa9' some-file
code }

}
{ Binary file ... matches

  Apparently, `grep` considers a file with a `NUL` character a binary file and won't by default print matched text for such files.

  In order to still print matches, one can use `-a` or the equivalent `--text` or still `--binary=text`.
