$ Shell: find regex's stored in a file with grep -f

`→ Linux/shell/commands/grep[grep] -f regexp.txt data.csv` finds lines that are stored in the `data.csv` that match the → Linux/shell/bash/variables/regular-expressions[regular expressions] that are stored in the
file `regexp.txt`.

`grep -f` is the abbreviation for `grep --file`.

{ Example

  The use of `grep -f` is demonstrated in the following simple example.
 
  This is `data.csv`, the file in which we want to search for regular expressions:
  gh|shell-commands|/grep/f-regular-expressions-in-file/data.csv||

  This is `regexp.txt`, the file that contains the regular expressions. Each regular expression occupies one line:
  gh|shell-commands|/grep/f-regular-expressions-in-file/regexp.txt||

  Executing `grep -f regexp.txt data.csv` prints the two lines that match the regular expressions stored in `regexp.txt`:
code {
def ghi;999;bar
barbarossa;33;qux
code }

}
