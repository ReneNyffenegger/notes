$ Shell command: md5sum

@ md5sum

`md5sum` computes an MD5 message digest or checks a file against the previously created message digest.

First, we create a file (`file.txt`) and compute its MD5 digest and → Linux/shell/bash/redirection/[redirect] it into `file.md5sum`.

Then, we use `file.md5sum` to check the integrity of `file.txt`.
gh|shell-commands|/md5sum/check-sum||

We tamper with `file.txt` …

… and check its integrity again:
