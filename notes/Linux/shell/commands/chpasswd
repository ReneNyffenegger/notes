$ Shell command: chpassswd
@ chpassswd

`chpassswd` can be used to change passwords in *batch mode*.

The following snippet changes the password of the user *fred* to *secretGarden*.

Apparently, it is useful if sudo was run recently and thus, root's password needs not be entered here.

code {
echo 'fred:secretGarden' | → Linux/shell/commands/sudo passwd
code }

  → Linux/shell/commands/passwd

  → Linux/shell/commands/index[Shell commands]

  → Linux/fhs/etc/passwd

  → Linux/shell/commands/chgpasswd
