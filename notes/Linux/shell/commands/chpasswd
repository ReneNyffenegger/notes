$ Shell command: chpasswd
@ chpasswd

`chpasswd` can be used to change → Linux/security/password[passwords] in *batch mode*.

The following snippet changes the password of the user *fred* to *secretGarden*.

Apparently, it is useful if sudo was run recently and thus, root's password needs not be entered here.

code {
echo 'fred:secretGarden' | → Linux/shell/commands/sudo passwd
code }

sa:

  → Linux/shell/commands[Shell commands] such as `→ Linux/shell/commands/passwd` and  `→ Linux/shell/commands/chgpasswd`

 `→ Linux/fhs/etc/passwd`
