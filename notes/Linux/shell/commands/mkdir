$ Shell command: mkdir
@ mkdir

{ Creating nested (sub-)directories

  mkdir (without `-p`) will won't create a directory under a directory that does not exist:
code {
$ mkdir foo/bar/baz
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘foo/bar/baz’: No such file or directory
code }

However, using the `-p` option, it will:
code {
$ mkdir foo/bar/baz
$ cd foo/bar/baz
code }

}
