*ANSI Escape Sequences* are instructions for consoles to position the cursor, change and set color and fonts and perform other operations.
-
These instructions are encoded in a series of characters whose first byte is the escape character (ASCII 27, octal `\033`, hex `0x1b`).
-
Apparently, VT 100 influenced these instructions heavily.

{ Assembling colors

  There are eight basic colors, each of which is identified by a single digit:
  table { rl
   0 ☰ black
   1 ☰ red
   2 ☰ green
   3 ☰ yellow
   4 ☰ blue
   5 ☰ purple
   6 ☰ cyan
   7 ☰ white
  table }

  Each of these colors has a *high intensity* variant.

  In order to create a color code, the color-digit needs to be prepended with one or two other digits (the dot represents the digit for the color):
  table { rl
     3. ☰ foreground / normal intensity
     4. ☰ background / normal intensity
     9. ☰ foreground / high intensity
    10. ☰ background / high intensity
  table }
  

}
{ Positioning the cursor

  Using `H` to position the cursor on specific coordinates.

  The first number ist the y coordinate, the second number the 
  x coordinate.

{ Clearing the screen

  gh|ANSI-escape-sequences|/clear-screen||

}
{ bg-48-fg-38-5

  The following script uses the `38;5` escape function to create 216 background colors (The red, green and blue components are each in the range 0 … 5)

  gh|ANSI-escape-sequences|/bg-48-fg-38-5||

  The output of the script is

  gh|ANSI-escape-sequences|/img/bg-48-fg-38-5.png||

  Apparently, → https://github.com/segaleran/eran-dotfiles/blob/master/bin/terminalcolors.py[python script] does more or less the same thing.
  -
  → https://gist.github.com/hSATAC/1095100[This is a perl script] does seems to do the same.
  -
  And then, there is also the shell command `msgcat --color=test`.

{ Determine sequence for specfic key on keyboard

  In order to determine a key's emitted sequence, one can use `ctrl-v` followed by the key.

}
{ PowerShell

  In PowerShell, the escape character can be expressed by casting *27* or its hexadecimal representation *0x1b* to a `char`:
code {
Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/host/write[write-host] "$([char]0x1b)[40;91m red on black $([char]27)[0m"
code }

  PowerShell 7 (6?) shortens this cast to a backtick-e which is visually easier to read:
code {
write-host "`e[32;103m green on intense yellow `e[0m"
code }

}
