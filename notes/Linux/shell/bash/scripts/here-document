$ Bash: here document

{ Creating a file #here-doc-create-file

  Combining → Linux/shell/commands/cat[`cat`] with a here document allows to create a file:
  gh|about-Bash|/scripts/here-document/cat-to-file||

}
{ Reading lines from a here document #here-doc-read-lines

  Similarly, lines can be read with → Linux/shell/bash/built-in/read[`read`] and a → Linux/shell/bash/while[`while` loop] to iterate
  over the lines of a here document:

  gh|about-Bash|/scripts/here-document/while-read||

}
{ Suppress leading tabulators

  If the *limit string* starts with a hyphen, leading tabulators are suppressed.
  
  Thus, it is possible to create here document with that look nicer.

  gh|about-Bash|/scripts/here-document/suppress-leading-tabs||

}
