$ Bash: $? exit status

`$?` stores the *exit status* of the last command.

In bash, an exit status of zero represents true and all non-zero values represent false.
Therfore, the exit status of → Linux/shell/commands/true[`true`] is `0`:
gh|about-Bash|/parameters/special/exit-status/true-and-false.sh||

{ C standard library

  With the c standard library, the exit status can be set with the accordingly named `exit()` function.

  The following program (`prog_0`) sets it to zero:
  gh|about-Bash|/parameters/special/exit-status/prog_0.c||

  And this program (`prog_1`) sets it to one:
  gh|about-Bash|/parameters/special/exit-status/prog_1.c||

  Bash's → Linux/shell/bash/if[`if`] statement decides the true or false value opon the evaluated command's exit status:
  gh|about-Bash|/parameters/special/exit-status/run.sh||

}
