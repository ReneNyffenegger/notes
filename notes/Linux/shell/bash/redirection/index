$ Bash redirection
@ redirection

{ Notation

  { fd> fileName

   `cmd fd> fileName` creates a file with name `fileName` and  redirects file descriptor *fd* (which is a number) to this file.
   
   If the file existed, it's first deleted

   If *fd* is not given, it defaults to `1`.

   There must be no space betweend *fd* and the `>`. Spaces between `>` and `fileName` are possible.

  }
  { fd>> fileName

     `cmd fd>> fileName` appends file descriptor to the file with name `fileName`
     
      If the file didn't exist, it is created.

      If *fd* is not given, it defaults to `1`.
  }
  { fdA>&fdB

    `fdA>&fdB` redirects file descriptor *fdA* to file descriptor *fdB*.

     If *fdA* is omitted, it defaults to `1`.

     There must be no spaces between *fdA*, `>` and *fdB*.
