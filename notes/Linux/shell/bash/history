The commands executed in a shell (at least in → Linux/shell/bash) are stored in a → Linux/fhs/home/username/_bash_history[history file].

{ Using !


Repeat previous command:
code {
!!
code }

Repeat most recent ls command:
code {
!ls
code }

Just print most recent ls command
code {
!ls:p
code }


}
{ Environment variables

  { HISTCONTROL #histcontrol

    When set to `ignorespace` (or `ignoreboth`), command lines starting with a space won't go to the history file.

  }
  { HISTIGNORE #histignore

    HISTIGNORE is a colon-delimited list of (non regexp?) patterns that should be ignored in the history file.

    The `&` is a special pattern to supress duplicate entries.
