The bash built-in `fc` processes the → Linux/shell/bash/history[command history list].

code {
fc
code }
Invokes → development/environment-variable#editor[`$EDITOR`] and lets one write a (possibly complex) → Linux/shell/commands[shell command]. After saving and closing the
editor, that command is executed. Alternatively, `<Esc>v` can be used (provided `set -o vi` is used)

{ esc v

  When in vi mode, `esc` followed by `v` also opens the editor. It has the advantage that the currently typed (but not executed) command is taken into the editor for further processing
