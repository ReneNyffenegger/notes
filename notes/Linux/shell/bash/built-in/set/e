$ Bash - Immediately exit a script when it encounters an error: set -e
@ set -e

`set -e` causes a script immediatly exits when it encounters an error. If one of the commands (or executables) that the script calls, returns a non-zero value, this is considered an error. 

`set -e` is equivalent to → Linux/shell/bash/built-in/set/o[`set -o errexit`].

The behaviour of `set -e` is demonstrated with the following four scripts (of which the latter three are called by the first one):

{ run.sh

  gh|about-Bash|/built-in/set/e/run.sh||

}
{ script-1.sh

  gh|about-Bash|/built-in/set/e/script-1.sh||

}
{ script-2.sh

  gh|about-Bash|/built-in/set/e/script-2.sh||

}
{ script-3.sh

  gh|about-Bash|/built-in/set/e/script-3.sh||

}

sa:
  → Linux/shell/bash/built-in

  → Linux/shell/bash/built-in/set

  Apparently, it's better to use `→ Linux/shell/bash/built-in/trap[trap] function ERR` instead of `set -e`.
