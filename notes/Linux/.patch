code {

code }

Creates file `0001-Changed-the-wrong-path-drivers-char-sysrq.c-to-the-c.patch`.

Use → Linux/kernel/source/scripts/get_maintainer_pl to find the maintainer for this patch:
code {
perl scripts/get_maintainer.pl 0001-Changed....
code }

Since it is a *trivial patch*, I also added `trivial@kernel.org` (the trivial patch monkey).

[PATCH] Fixed spelling errors within comments

This is my first patch submission. Please let me know if I have made a mistake anywhere.

To check if the mail with the patch is ok, it is a good approach is to email
the patch to yourself and ensure that the result applies before trying again.


{ Sending the patch with Thunderbird

  Unfortunately, I was unable to to setup git so that it can send mails - I therefore used →tools/Thunderbird

  According to → Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/email-clients_txt, I first had to install an «external editor»
  for Thunderbird (I Used → tools/Thunderbird#external-editor[this one]).

  Then, I had also to got to *Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Config Editor* and make the these changes
    • mailnews.send_plaintext_flowed = false
    • mailnews.wraplength = 0

  Also, View -> Character Encoding should be *Unicode* and View -> Message Body As should be *Plain Text*.

  Finally, messages should be sent as *plain text*: Account Settings -> Composition & Addressing : Uncheck *Compose messages in HTML format*.
