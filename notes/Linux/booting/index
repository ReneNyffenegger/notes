$ booting Linux

→ development/boot-loader[boot loaders] for Linux: → Linux/booting/GRUB, → Linux/booting/SYSLINUX, → Linux/booting/LILO.

Among others, the → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/kernel[kernel] initializes the → Linux/Clocks#system-clock[system clock] from the
→ Linux/Clocks#hardware-clock[hardware clock] when the system is booted up.

{ Tasks to bring up a system

   When a linux system is booted up, severel tasks need to be accomplished:
     • mount virtual → Linux/filesystem[file systems]
     • initialize devices
     • mount a file system unto `/`. This is special because it does not involve the `mount` system call, and there is no file system where it is mounted into.
     • mount swap partitions or  swap files
     • check integrity of file systems (for example with → Linux/shell/commands/fsck[`fsck`])
     • activate → Linux/swap-space[swap]
     • set the → Linux/Clocks/index#system-clock[system clock]
     • connect to the internet/network
     • start the → Linux/kernel/process[process] with PID 1. This is special because it does not use `fork`.
     • start daemons

  These tasks should run as parallel as possible to bring up the system as fast as possible.
