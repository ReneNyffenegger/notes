wp:GNU_GRUB

GRUB stands for *Grand Unified Bootloader*.

GRUB can not only load Linux but other Operating Systems as well.

Arguably the most flexible →development/boot-loader for → Linux. Other Linux boot loaders are → Linux/booting/SYSLINUX and → Linux/booting/LILO.

→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/grub/_cpu_-_platform_/index[image directory] (s.a. → Linux/booting/GRUB/image-files).

{ GRUB Legacy vs GRUB 2

  There are two versions of GRUB:
    • GRUB Legacy (also referred to as GRUB 1)
    • GRUB 2

  Both of these versions can be referred to as GRUB, making it impossible to distinguish between them.

  Development on GRUB Legacy has halted. GRUB 2should be used.

{ Installing GRUB

  GRUB is usually installed into the → hardware/harddisk/MBR[MBR], using `→ Linux/shell/commands/grub-install`, for example `grub-install → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[/dev/sda]``.

}
{ Bootloader

  GRUB's bootloader apparently loads → Linux/fhs/boot/grub/i386-pc/boot_img, then `→ Linux/fhs/boot/grub/i386-pc/core_img`, then
 `→ Linux/fhs/boot/grub/grub_cfg` and then the necessary `*.mod` files (under `→ Linux/fhs/boot/grub/i386-pc`).

}

{ Two boot methods

  GRUB boots either
  • the OS directly, or
  • it uses *chain-load* which loads another → Linux/booting/boot-loader[boot loader]


}

{ Windows

  GRUB cannot directly boot Windows, it needs the *chain-load* mechanism.

{ TODO

  Stanza

}

sa:

  → Linux/fhs/boot/grub/

  → Linux/fhs/boot/grub/grub_cfg

  → Linux/booting/boot-loader[boot loaders].
