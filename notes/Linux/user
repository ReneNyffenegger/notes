$ User [Unix]

In Unix, a user is identified by a user id (UID) (and often by a name). Such a user has a → Linux/home-directory (typically under → Linux/fhs/home/index).
This directory is pointed at by the → development/environment-variable#home environment variable.

A user belongs to one or more → Linux/group[groups].
The groups that a user belongs to is shown with the → Linux/shell/commands/id[`id`] command.

Adding users: → Linux/shell/commands/adduser, → Linux/shell/commands/useradd.
