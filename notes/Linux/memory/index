$ Linux: memory
@ memory

A → Linux/kernel/process[process'] *virtual address space* is divided into *segments* which are contiguous ranges of virtual addresses.
-
There are three important segements:
  • *text*: the actual program (machine instructions)
  • *data*: the working data storage for the process
  • *stack*

{ Address translation

  Address translation (or address binding) is the mapping of virtual addresses onto physical addresses.
