$ Linux: memory
@ memory

A → Linux/kernel/process[process'] *virtual address space* is divided into *segments* which are contiguous ranges of virtual addresses.
-
There are three important segements:
  • *text*: the actual program (machine instructions)
  • *data*: the working data storage for the process
  • *stack*

The three main memory allocators are
table { ll
  `kmalloc` ☰ Fast and efficieant for small memory blocks (say less than 128 KB)
  `vmalloc` ☰ Allows to allocate large memory blocks in the virtual address space, even if no contiguous address space is availabe.
  `slab` ☰ Used for memory that is frequently used by the Kernel (network packets, disk buffers etc). Such memory is reused when possible, rather than freeing and reallocating them.
table }

{ Address translation

  Address translation (or address binding) is the mapping of virtual addresses onto physical addresses.
