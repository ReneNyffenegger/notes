$ Linux: read and write another process's memory
@ Read and write another process's memory

This is an example that tries to show how a c program can read from and write into another → Linux/kernel/process[process's] → Linux/memory.

The example consists of two sources that each need to be compiled into an executable.

{ proc-1.c

  This is the first source. It prints its PID and the address and length of a variable (`foo`).

  gh|about-Linux|/memory/read-write-another-processes-memory/proc-1.c||

}
{ proc-2.c

  This program takes the information that the first program printed to open a »file« and read the memory of the variable of the first program.

  After it has printed the value of the variable it overwrites it with another string. The first program will then see the new value.

}

sa:
  → Linux/memory
