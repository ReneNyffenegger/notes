$ Direct Rendering Infrastructure

Abbreviated by: *DRI*.

DRI is a framework that allows processes to safely and efficiently access graphic hardware.

→ Linux/X (via → Linux/graphic/mesa/ ?) installs DRI if the graphic card supports it.

Apparently, a → Linux/user must be member of the → Linux/group#group-video[video group] to be able to access graphic hardware acceleration.

{ Checking if DRI is enabled

code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/grep DRI → Linux/fhs/var/log/Xorg_N_log[/varlog/Xorg.0.log]
code }
should print something like `(II) intel(0): direct rendering: DRI2 enabled`

Alternatively, if `glxinfo` is installed, the following → Linux/shell/commands/grep can be used:
code {
glxinfo | grep -B2 'direct rendering'
code }
It should print
code {
name of display: :0
display: :0 screen: 0
direct rendering: Yes
code }

Finally, the working of DRI can be confirmed with
code {
glxinfo | egrep 'OpenGL (vendor|renderer|version)'
code }
If this `egrep` *does not* print something like `Software Rasterizer`, then the → Linux/user who ran this command has working acceleration.
