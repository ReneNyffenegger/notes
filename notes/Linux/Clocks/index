$ Clocks in Linux

There are two types of clocks in a Linux systems: the hardware clock and 

{ Hardware clock #hardware-clock

  Gone to → hardware/PC/real-time-clock[real time clock].


}
{ System clock #system-clock

  The system clock is operated by the Linux kernel and updated through → Linux/kernel/interrupt[interrupts].

  The value of the system clock is the number of seconds since January first, 1970, 00:00:00. As the precision
  of this value is of infinite precision (if desired?), it is not limited to integers.

  The system clock is initialized from the value of the hardware clock when the system is → Linux/booting/index[booted up].

  The current system clock time can be read with → Linux/shell/commands/timedatectl[`timedatectl`].

}

sa:
  → Linux/shell/commands/hwclock, → Linux/shell/commands/timedatectl, → Linux/fhs/etc/adjtime, → Linux/fhs/dev/rtc

  → Linux/Clocks/NTP

  → hardware/PC/real-time-clock

  → hardware/Motorola-MC146818

  → Linux/timezone

  → Linux/shell/commands/faketime[`faketime`] and the *fudgetime utilities*.
