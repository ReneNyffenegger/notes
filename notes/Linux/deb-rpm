$ .deb / .rpm

{ .deb files  

  For Debian derivatives (such as Ubuntu)

  On Ubuntu, a `.deb` file is apparently installed like so
code {
→ Linux/distributions/Debian/dpkg/index[dpkg] -i file.deb
code }

}

{ .rpm

  Red Hat, Fedora, Suse

  → Linux/rpm

}

{ TODO

  Is there also a *slp* format by stampede? 

}
