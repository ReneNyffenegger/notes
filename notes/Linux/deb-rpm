$ .deb / .rpm

{ .deb files  

  For Debian derivatives (such as Ubuntu)

  A `.deb` file contains
    • the files that are needed to run an application (`dpkg -c pkg.deb`) and
    • additional data such as dependencies on other packages (`dpkg -i pkg.deb`).

  On Ubuntu, a `.deb` file is apparently installed like so
code {
→ Linux/distributions/Debian/dpkg/index[dpkg] -i file.deb
code }


}

{ .rpm

  Red Hat, Cent OS, Fedora, Suse

  → Linux/rpm

}

{ TODO

  Is there also a *slp* format by stampede? 

  Apparently, `alien` can convert between `.deb` and `.rpm` packages.

}
