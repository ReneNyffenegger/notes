$ .deb / .rpm

{ .deb files  

  For Debian derivatives (such as Ubuntu)

  A `.deb` file contains
    • the files that are needed to run an application (`dpkg -c pkg.deb`) and
    • additional data such as dependencies on other packages (`dpkg -i pkg.deb`).

  On Ubuntu, a `.deb` file is apparently installed like so
code {
→ Linux/distributions/Debian/dpkg/index[dpkg] -i file.deb
code }


}

{ .rpm

  Red Hat, Cent OS, Fedora, Suse

  → Linux/package-managers/RPM

}

{ TODO

  Is there also a *slp* format by stampede? 

  → https://sourceforge.net/projects/alien-pkg-convert[alien-pkg-convert] is a → development/languages/Perl utility than can convert RPM packges various other
  package formats (such as between .rpm and .deb)
