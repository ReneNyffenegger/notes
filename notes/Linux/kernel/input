{ libinput

  libinput is an input stack for processes that need to provide events from commonly used input devices such as
    • mice
    • keyboards
    • touchpads
    • touchscreens
    • graphics tablets
    • virtual absolute pointing devices such as those used by QEMU or VirtualBox
    • switches (lid switch and tablet mode switch)
    • trackpoints and pointing sticks

  A notable absent input device type is the *joystick*.

  { Wayland

    libinput is not used directly by Wayland applications, rather it is used a an input stack used by the compositor.

  }
  { X.Org

    X applications use libinput indirectly through the custom *xf86-input-libinput* driver.

  }
