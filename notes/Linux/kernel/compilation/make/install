$ Kernel compilation: make install
@ install

? `→ Linux/kernel/compilation/make install` installs the → Linux/kernel using `~/bin/installkernel` or (distribution) `→ Linux/fhs/sbin/installkernel` or install to `$(INSTALL_PATH)` and run → Linux/booting/LILO.
-
? On the other hand, it also seems like `make install` calls `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/install_sh`

The script that is invoked to install the kernel can be overridden by setting the environment variable `INSTALLKERNEL`.

sa:

 `→ Linux/fhs/sbin/installkernel`

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/install_sh`
