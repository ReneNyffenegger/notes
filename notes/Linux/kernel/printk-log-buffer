aka: kernel ring buffer or kernel log buffer

The kernel ring buffer is a *cyclic buffer* whose size is controlled by `LOG_BUF_LEN`.


{ printk #printk

  `printk` (defined in → Linux/kernel/source/kernel/printk/printk_c) fills the *kernel log buffer*  with messages. The size of the log buffer is (`1<<→ Linux/kernel/CONFIG/LOG_BUF_SHIFT`)

}

{ Log levels

  Each message is associated with a log level:
    • `KERN_EMERG`   (0) - System is unusable
    • `KERN_ALERT`   (1) - Action must be taken immediatly
    • `KERN_CRIT`    (2) - Critical conditions
    • `KERN_ERR`     (3) - Error conditions
    • `KERN_WARNING` (4) - Warning conditions
    • `KERN_NOTICE`  (5) - Normal, but significant condition
    • `KERN_INFO`    (6) - Informational
    • `KERN_DEBUG`   (7) - Debug-level messages

  { Console log level #console-log-level

    Messages with a log level less than the *console log level* are printed to the console.

    The console log level corresponds to the first number in → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/kernel/printk.

  }
     
}

{ TODO

  It seems as though `printk` can only be used when PDA is initialized.

}


sa:

  → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/kernel/printk

  → Linux/kernel/CONFIG/LOG_BUF_SHIFT

  → Linux/shell/commands/dmesg[`dmesg`] can be used to examine the kernel ring buffer.
