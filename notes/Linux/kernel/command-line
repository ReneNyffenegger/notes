$ Linux kernel command line

The kernel command line consists of `name=value` pairs. It is exhibited through `→ Linux/fhs/proc/cmdline`.

Unrecognized kernel parameters will be passed to user space.

sa:

 `__setup`, defined in `→ Linux/kernel/source/include/linux/init_h`, seems to be a macro with which command line options can be declared.

  `→ Linux/kernel/source/lib/cmdline_c`
    -
  `→ Linux/kernel/source/kernel/params_c` (for example the function `parse_args()`).
     -
  `→ Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/lib/cmdline_c`
