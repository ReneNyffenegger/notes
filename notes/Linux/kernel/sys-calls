A program requests the execution of a service provided by the → Linux/kernel[kernel] through *system calls* (aka «kernel calls»). These calls are identified by a number (
  see  → Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64_tbl and
  → Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64_h)

{ TODO

Syscall entry points seem to be indacted by the `SYSCALL_DEFINE1` .. `SYSCALL_DEFINE6` macros (defined in → Linux/kernel/source/include/linux/syscalls_h).

Time related syscall interfaces are found in → Linux/kernel/source/kernel/time/time_c.
