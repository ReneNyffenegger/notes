When →Linux/index boots up, it needs a disk to store files (such as →Linux/kernel/module[kernel modules]) in order to mount the real/physical disk. This disk that is needed during the
boot process is called *initial ram disk* and is stored entirly in memory.

At times, the initial ram disk is abbreviated with *initrd*.

→Linux/shell/commands/mkinitcpio can be used to create initrams.

{ Preset #preset

  A preset is a reusable definition to create (multiple) initial ramdisks with the `-p` flag in →Linux/shell/commands/mkinitcpio.
