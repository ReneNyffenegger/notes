A *keymap* is a → hardware/keyboard table description.

The format is *vaguely* similar to those accepted by → Linux/shell/commands/xmodmap.

The kernel has a *keymap* built into it. This keymap can be modified with → Linux/shell/commands/loadkeys and viewed with → Linux/shell/commands/dumpkeys.

The kernel source contains a default keymap: → Linux/kernel/source/drivers/tty/vt/defkeymap_map.

{ Keycode definition #keycode-definition

code {
→ hardware/keyboard#keycode[keycode] keynumber = → hardware/keyboard#keysym[keysym] keysym keysym ...
code }

*keynumber* is an internal identification number for a key, roughly equivalent to its → hardware/keyboard#scancode[scancode].
