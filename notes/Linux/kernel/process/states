$ Linux process states

A linux → Linux/kernel/process[process] is in one of the following states:
  • (R)unning or runnable (on the run queue)
  • (U)ninterruptible sleep (waiting for some event)
  • (I)nterruptible sleep (waiting for an event or or a signal)
  • (S)topped (either by job control signal or because of being traced by a debugger)
  • (Z)ombie process (terminated, but not reaped by parent process)

`→ Linux/shell/commands/ps#ps-long[ps -l]` shows the state of a process in the first character of the `STAT` column.
There are also optional attributes such as `s` for a session leader or `+` if the process is part of a foreground process group.

Additionally, the `WCHAN` (wait channel) column shows which kernel event a sleeping process is waiting for.
