$ Linux signals

A signal interrupts the execution of a → Linux/kernel/process. In certain situations (such as when the cpu is asked to divide a number by zero or trying to access invalid memory), the operation system
uses signals to notify a process of this situation.

{ Signal numbrs

  A signal is identified by its number.

  For *software interrupts*, the number is between 0 and 255. For *exceptions* (like `SIGINT`, `SIGHUP` etc) , the range is between 256 and 287.

}
{ Handling signals

  Except for *SIGKILL* and *SIGSTOP*, a process can handle signals differently:
    • Ignore it.
    • Accept default action.
    • Use its own specific signal handler.
