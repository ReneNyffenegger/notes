$ Linux signals

A *signal* is a *software interrupt* that is sent to a → Linux/kernel/process. Thus, it is a means to report the occurence of exceptional situations to a process.

A signal interrupts the execution of a → Linux/kernel/process. In certain situations (such as when the cpu is asked to divide a number by zero or trying to access invalid memory), the operation system
uses signals to notify a process of this situation.

{ Signal numbrs

  A signal is identified by its number.

  For *software interrupts*, the number is between 0 and 255. For *exceptions* (like `SIGINT`, `SIGHUP` etc) , the range is between 256 and 287.

}
{ Handling signals

  Except for *SIGKILL* and *SIGSTOP*, a process can handle signals differently:
    • Ignore it.
    • Accept default action.
    • Use its own specific signal handler.
}

{ Some signals

  The following section lists a few signals and their default *dispostion* (which is what a process should do when it receives the signal).
  
  { SIGTERM #sigterm
  
    Terminate a → Linux/kernel/process. Even →Linux/daemons react to this signal.
  
  }
  { SIGHUP
  }
  { SIGINT #sigint

   The → Linux/TTY driver sends SIGINT when the *interactive attention character* (default: ctrl-c, ascii 3) was found in the input stream.

   The interactive attention character can be changed with → Linux/shell/commands/stty#stty-intr[`stty intr`].

  }
  { SIGQUIT

    `SIGQUIT` is similar to `SIGINT`. The triggering character is `^\`
    
  }
  { SIGPIPE

    `SIGPIPE` is sent to processes that attempt to write into a pipe without a reader.

    For example: a `SIGPIPE` terminates `→ Linux/shell/commands/yes` in `
  }
  { SIGCHILD

    `SIGCHILD` is sent to the parent → Linux/kernel/process that changes its state.

  }
  { SIGSTOP

    `SIGSTOP` suspends the respective process. The signal can not be reconfigured by a process.

    The suspended process will resume work with a `SIGCONT` signal
    
  }
  { SIGCONT

    Resume a stopped process (See `SIGSTOP`).
     
  }
  { SIGTSTP
  }
  { SIGTTIN
  }
  { SIGTTOU
  }
  { SIGWINCH
  }

}
{ TODO

  `→ Linux/shell/commands/ps[ps] -s`

}

sa:

  → Linux/shell/commands/kill[`kill`]
  -
  Use `→Linux/shell/commands/kill -l` to list implemented signals.

  Signals can be traced with → Linux/shell/commands/strace[`strace`].
