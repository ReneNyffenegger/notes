  A process is executing either in user space or in kernel space.

  When executing in user space, the process can or cannot do certain things
  according to its privileges.

  A process switches to kernel space by calling a → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[syscall].

  ?Exception: → Linux/kernel/syscalls/iopl

  ?Apparently user space is also called user mode, kernel space is also called kernel mode.

  Between user and kernel space «lies» the → Linux/kernel/ABI.
