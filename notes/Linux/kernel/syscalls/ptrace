On Linux, → development/tools/gdb[gdb] apparently used `ptrace` to debug a program.

  → Linux/kernel/sys-calls,
  → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

  → Linux/kernel/source/kernel/ptrace_c

  → Linux/shell/commands/strace[`strace`] which provides to ability to trace → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[system calls] of the traced program.

  `ltrace` is similar to `strace` but also traces calls from dynamic library functions.
