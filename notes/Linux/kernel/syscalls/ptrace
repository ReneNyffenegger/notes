`ptrace` is a system call that allows → Linux/kernel/process[process] to trace systems calls made by their child processes.

When a (parent) process uses `ptrace` to monitor the system calls of (one of) its child processes, the parent-process gets a notification (call back function) right *before* the child's
system call is executed. The parent can then inspect inspect the values in the CPU-registers and those on the stack and, if desired, change them. When the parent is done
inspecting these values, the syscall will be executed (possibly with the changed values). When the syscall returns, the parent process is notified again to have a possibility
to check the syscall's return value or other data.

`ptrace` is not a → Linux/POSIX system call. Thus, it is not standardized among different UNIX flavours.

On Linux, → development/tools/gdb[gdb] apparently used `ptrace` to debug a program.

  → Linux/kernel/sys-calls,
  → Linux/fhs/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

  → Linux/kernel/source/kernel/ptrace_c

  → Linux/shell/commands/strace[`strace`] which provides to ability to trace → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[system calls] of the traced program.

  `ltrace` is similar to `strace` but also traces calls from dynamic library functions.
