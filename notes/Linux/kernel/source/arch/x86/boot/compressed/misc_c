  This is a collection of several routines used to extract the kernel which
  includes KASLR relocation, decompression, ELF parsing, and relocation
  processing. Additionally included are the screen and serial output functions
  and related debugging support functions.

This code is relocated dynamically at run time (compiled with → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/GCC/options/f/pic[`-fPIC`]).

The source also contains this note: *When adding a new decompressor, please update the analysis in → Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/header_S[`../header.S`]*.
