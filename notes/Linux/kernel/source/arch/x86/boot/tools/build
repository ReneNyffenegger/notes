$ arch/x86/boot/tools/build

`arch/x86/boot/tools/build` is a tool to buld a *disk-image* (like `→ Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/bzImage`) from the following three files:
  • → Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/setup_bin[`setup.bin`] (8068 machine code to set up system parm)
  • → Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/vmlinux_bin[`vmlinux.bin`] (80386 code for actual systems)
  • → Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/zoffset_h[`zoffset.h`] (Header with `ZO_*` defines)

One of the tasks of `arch/x86/boot/tools/build` is to update some pre-reserved fields that are declared in `→ Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/header_S` (such as the size of the resulting `bzImage`, the address of the entry point).
