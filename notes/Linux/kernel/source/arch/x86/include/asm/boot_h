 `LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR` is the physical address at which the kernel should be loaded.

  This value is defined as
code {
#define LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR ((CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START \
                                + (CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN - 1)) \
                                & ~(CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN - 1))
code }

  The default of `CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START` is → https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9ed22ae6be817d7a3f5c15ca22cbc9d3963b481d/arch/x86/Kconfig#L2067[`0x1000000`].
