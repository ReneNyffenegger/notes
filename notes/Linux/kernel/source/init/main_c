$ init/main.c

Then it spawns the idle → Linux/kernel/process[process], the → Linux/kernel/process/scheduler[process scheduler] and the → Linux/init[init process]

Apparently, `main.c` also processes the *bootparams* (such as `root=`, `init=` etc.)

{ start_kernel()

  `start_kernel()` performs most of the kernel setup:
     • → Linux/kernel/interrupts[interrupts]
     • memory management
     • → hardware/device initialization
     • → Linux/kernel/drivers

  The last function that `start_kernel` calls is `rest_init()`. This function apparently does not return.
}
{ do_basic_setup()

  This function is called when the machine is initialized and the CPU subsystem is started.

  None of the devices have been touched at this moment.

}
{ kernel_init_freeable() #kernel_init_freeable

  This function opens, among others, → Linux/fhs/dev/console

}

sa:

  → Linux/kernel/boot-process
