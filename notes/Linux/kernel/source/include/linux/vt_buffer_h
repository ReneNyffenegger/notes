$ include/linux/vt_buffer.h

 A set of macros and functions which are used in the console driver and related
 code to access the screen buffer. In most cases the console works with simple
 in-memory buffer, but when handling hardware text mode consoles, we store the
 foreground console directly in video memory.

 { scr_writew, scr_readw

  `scr_writew(val, addr)` writes the value `val` to the location pointed at by the pointer `addr`:
code {
#define scr_writew(val, addr) (*(addr) = (val))
code }

  Similar idea:
code {
#define scr_readw(addr) (*(addr))
code }

}
