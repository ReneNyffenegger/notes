$ include/linux/ctype.h

`include/linux/ctype.h` defines the following macros:
   • `isalnum(c)`
   • `isalpha(c)`
   • `iscntrl(c)`
   • `isgraph(c)`
   • `islower(c)`
   • `isprint(c)`
   • `ispunct(c)`
   • `isspace(c)`
   • `isupper(c)`
   • `isxdigit(c)`
   • `isascii(c)`
   • `toascii(c)`
   • `isdigit(c)` (if not available as GCC built-in, `isdigit` is an inline function)
   • `tolower(c)`
   • `toupper(c)`

A comment in the source file states that EOF is not handled as required by the standard C library.

sa:
  `lib/ctype.c` defines the value of `_ctype[]`.
