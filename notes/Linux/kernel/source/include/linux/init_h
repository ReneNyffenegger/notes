$ include/linux/init.h

Macros used to mark functions or initialized data as *initialization* functions.

The kernel can take this as a hint that the function is used only during the initialization phase and free up used memory resources after.

`__setup` seems to be a macro with which â†’ Linux/kernel/command-line[command line] options can be declared, try
code {
$ grep -r __setup > ~/github/temp/Linux/kernel/source/greps/__setup
code }

Using `__setup` is somehow associated with the `struct obs_kernel_param`:
code {
struct obs_kernel_param {
   const char *str;
   int (*setup_func)(char *);
   int early;
};
code }
