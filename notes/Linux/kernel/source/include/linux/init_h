$ include/linux/init.h

Macros used to mark functions or initialized data as *initialization* functions.

The kernel can take this as a hint that the function is used only during the initialization phase and free up used memory resources after.

{ __setup #linux-src-__setup

  `__setup` seems to be a macro with which → Linux/kernel/command-line[command line] options can be declared, try
code {
$ grep -r __setup > ~/github/temp/Linux/kernel/source/greps/__setup
code }


  Using `__setup` is somehow associated with the `struct obs_kernel_param`:
code {
struct obs_kernel_param {
   const char *str;
   int (*setup_func)(char *);
   int early;
};
code }

  The script `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/checkpatch_pl` explicitly checks for new command line options that might be added but were forgotten to be documented in `→ Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters_txt`, see
  → https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/affc5af36bbb62073b6aaa4f4459b38937ff5331/scripts/checkpatch.pl#L2706-L2708[here] and
  → https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/affc5af36bbb62073b6aaa4f4459b38937ff5331/scripts/checkpatch.pl#L7177-L7185[here].

{ early_param #linux-src-early_param

  The `early_param` defines → Linux/kernel/command-line#linux-cmd-line-early-params[early command line parameters].
