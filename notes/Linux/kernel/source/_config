$ .config

`.config`is an → development/Unicode/ASCII that stores the values of the *config symbols*.

This file is not part of the git source tree, it must be created before building/making the kernel, for example with `make menuconfig`. After its creation, it's located in the top directory
of the kernel source tree.

The content of the `.config` file, that is: the values of the config symbols, determine, among others, which → Linux/kernel/drivers/index are built, and if so if they're built into the kernel or as
loadable module.

  → Linux/fhs/proc/config_gz,
  → Linux/kernel/source/_config_old
