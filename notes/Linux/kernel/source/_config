$ .config

The `.config` file in the kernel source directory determines which → Linux/kernel/drivers/index are built, and if so if they're built into the kernel or as
loadable module.

The `.config` file is not part of the git source tree, it must be created before buidling/making the kernel.


sa:

  → Linux/fhs/proc/config_gz,
  → Linux/kernel/source/_config_old
