$ .config

`.config` is the default kernel configuration file.
-
This file is an → development/Unicode/ASCII file that stores the values of the → Linux/kernel/CONFIG[config symbols] (which determine, among others, which → Linux/kernel/drivers are built, and if so if they're built into the kernel or as
loadable module).

{ Creation of the .config file

  This file is not part of the git source tree, it must be created before → Linux/kernel/compilation[compiling the kernel], for example with
code {
$ → Linux/kernel/compilation/make menuconfig
code }

   Alternatively, the default configuration can be produced with
code {
$ → Linux/kernel/compilation/make/defconfig
code }

   After its creation, it's located in the → Linux/kernel/source[top directory of the kernel source tree].

}
{ Using a non-default config file

  When building the Kernel, a non-default config file can be specified using the environment variable `KCONFIG_CONFIG`:
code {
$ → Linux/kernel/compilation/make KCONFIG_CONFIG=config-lean
code }

}
{ Scripted manipulation of .config values

 `.config` values can be manipulated from shell scripts or the command line with `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/config`.

}

sa:

  The environment variable `KCONFIG_CONFIG` specifies the path to an alternate kernel config file (if set).

  The environment variable `KCONFIG_DEFCONFIG_LIST` specifies a list of config files which can be used as basis to create `.config` if `.config` does not exist.
  -
  The elements in this list are separated by spaces.

  The environment variable `KCONFIG_OVERWRITECONFIG` can be set to prevent Kconfig from breaking symlinked `.config` files.

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/include/config/auto_conf` mirrors the content of `.config.

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/config` allows to manipulate options in a `.config` file from the command line.

 `→ Linux/fhs/proc/config_gz`,
 `→ Linux/kernel/source/_config_old`
