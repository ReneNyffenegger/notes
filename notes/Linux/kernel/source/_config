$ .config

`.config` is the default kernel configuration file.
-
This file is an → development/Unicode/ASCII file that stores the values of the *config symbols*.

This file is not part of the git source tree, it must be created before building/making the kernel, for example with
code {
→ Linux/kernel/compilation/make menuconfig`
code }
After its creation, it's located in the top directory of the kernel source tree.

The content of the `.config` file, that is: the values of the config symbols, determine, among others, which → Linux/kernel/drivers/index are built, and if so if they're built into the kernel or as
loadable module.

A non-default config file can be specified using the environment variable `KCONFIG_CONFIG`:
code {
$ → Linux/kernel/compilation/make KCONFIG_CONFIG=config-lean
code }

sa:

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/include/config/auto_conf` mirrors the content of `.config.

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/config` allows to manipulate options in a `.config` file from the command line.

 `→ Linux/fhs/proc/config_gz`,
 `→ Linux/kernel/source/_config_old`
