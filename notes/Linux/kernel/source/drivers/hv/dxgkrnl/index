$ drivers/hv/dxgkrnl

`drivers/hv/dxgkrnl` contains the sources for the *dxgkrnl* driver which supports paravirtualized virtual compute devices, exposed by → Windows/optional-features/Hyper-V when Linux is running inside of a virtual machine (such as for example → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux).
hosted by Windows.

Although this driver shares the name with the Windows counterpart, it is a clean room implementation of a Linux GPU driver based on Microsoft's GPU-PV protocol.

The `→ Linux/kernel/source/drivers/hv[drivers/hv]/dxgkrnl` directory is added to the Kernel development of → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux (See → https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/tree/linux-msft-wsl-6.1.y/drivers/hv/dxgkrnl[their Github repository]).

In order to compile this driver, the config symbol `CONFIG_DXGKRNL` must be set.
