→ https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin-guide/efi-stub.rst[`Documentation/admin-guide/efi-stub.rst`] says that
`drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/x86-stub.c` and `→ Linux/kernel/source/arch/x86/boot/header_S` are collectively known as the *EFI boot stub*, which is the code
that modifies the `bzImage` header along with the EFI-specific entry point which the firmware loader jumps to.
