$ drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c

? Is the scancode -> keycode mapping happening here?

{ kbd_connect()

  This function is called when a keyboard (or another input device) is found.

  If the function determines that it likes the device, it opens it to get events from it.

  The function apparently also decides which VT a keyboard is initially bound to.
