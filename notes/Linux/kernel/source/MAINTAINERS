  table { ll

    `M` ☰ *Mail* patches to: `FullName <address@domain>`.
    `R` ☰ Reviewer: `FullName <address@domain>`. These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
    `L` ☰ → Linux/kernel#linux-kernel-mailing-list[Mailing list] that is relevant to this area
    `S` ☰ *Status*, one of the following: `Supported`:	Someone is actually paid to look after this; `Maintained`:	Someone actually looks after it. `Odd Fixes`: It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do much other than throw the odd patch in.  `Orphan`:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the role as you write your new code]. `Obsolete`: Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means it has been replaced by a better system and you should be using that.
    `W` ☰ *Web-page* with status/info
    `Q` ☰ *Patchwork* web based patch tracking system site
    `B` ☰ URI for where to file *bugs*. A web-page with detailed bug filing info, a direct bug tracker link, or a mailto: URI.
    `C` ☰ URI for *chat* protocol, server and channel where developers usually hang out, for example `irc://server/channel`.
    `P` ☰ Subsystem Profile document for more details submitting patches to the given subsystem. This is either an in-tree file, or a URI. See `Documentation/maintainer/maintainer-entry-profile.rst` for details.
    `T` ☰ *SCM* tree type and location.  Type is one of `git`, `hg`, `quilt`, `stgit` or `topgit`
    `F` ☰ *Files* and directories wildcard patterns.  A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.  `F: drivers/net/:` all files in and below `drivers/net`; `F drivers/net/*` all files in `drivers/net`, but not below; `F */net/*`: all files in *any top level directory* `/net`.  One pattern per line but multiple `F` lines acceptable.
    `X` ☰ *Excluded* files and directories that are *not* maintained, same rules as for `F:`. Files exclusions are tested before file matches.  Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance: `F: net/` and `X: net/ipv6/`  matches all files in and below `net` excluding `net/ipv6/`.
    `N` ☰ Files and directories → development/regular-expressions[regex] patterns. (`N: [^a-z]tegra` matches all files whose path ends on `tegra`, files like `integrator` are not included). One pattern per line, multiple `N:` lines acceptable. `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/get_maintainer_pl` has different behavior for files that match `F:` pattern and matches of `N:`  patterns. By default `get_maintainer.pl` will not look at *git log* history when an `F:`  pattern match occurs. When an `N:`  match occurs, *git log history* is used to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.
    `K` ☰ *Content regex* (perl extended) pattern match in a patch or file.

{ Get list of subsystems

code {
$ → development/languages/awk 'BEGIN {emptyLine=0} /^\s*$/ {emptyLine=1; next} emptyLine {print; emptyLine=0}' MAINTAINERS

 As of Linux version 6.5, these are approximately 2700 subsystems!

{ Get files and file patterns for a given subsystem

  The following command finds the files and file patterns that are maintained by the *EXTENSIBLE FIRMWARE INTERFACE (EFI)* subsystem.
code {
$ → development/languages/sed/examples/print-between-patterns[sed] -n '/EXTENSIBLE FIRMWARE INTERFACE (EFI)/,/^\s*$/p' MAINTAINERS  | → Linux/shell/commands/grep '^F:'
F:      Documentation/admin-guide/efi-stub.rst

F:      arch/arm/boot/compressed/efi-header.S

}
{ Get number of maintainers

  As of version 6.5, there are approximately 1700 mainainters:
code {
grep "^M:" MAINTAINERS | awk -F '\t' '{print $2}' | sort -u | wc -l
code }

  The number reported is too high because of different spellings or email addresses of maintainers.
