$ Kernel sources: Development

{ Patches

  Patches must be prepared against a specific version of the kernel (typically the current mainline version) - but sometimes, it's necessary to create a patch against *linux-next*, -mm or a subsystem tree.

  Complex modification or additions of functionality should be submitted as a *series of patches*.

  Use `scripts/checkpatch.pl` to verify the format of a patch.

  { Mailing patches

    Patches should always be sent in plain text format.

    { Subject line

     `[PATCH nn/mm] subsys: one-line description of the patch` where `nn` is a counter and `mm` the number of patches in a series and subsys is the name of the affected subsystem.
     -
     `nn/mm` can be omitted for single standalone patches.

? Before a patch is applied to the Linux repository, if typically goes into on of → https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git[the other repositories].
