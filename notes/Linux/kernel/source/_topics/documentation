$ Linux kernel sources: Documentation

Some documentation about the kernel sources is found under `→ Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/` directory.
-
This documentation is complemented in the source files itself as *kerneldoc comments* (i.e. comments that start with `/**`),

{ Kernel-doc comments #linux-kernel-doc

  Kernel-doc comments are C comments that start with `/**` (and thus are similar to javadoc, gtk-doc or Doxygen).
  -
  Such comments can be interpreted by `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/kernel-doc` and `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/split-man_pl`.

 `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/find-unused-docs_sh` detects files with kernel-doc comments for exported functions that are not included in documentation.


  Kernel-doc comments should be written for (or is at least advisable for)
    • Every function exported to loadable modules using `EXPORT_SYMBOL` or `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`
    • Functions and data structures in → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/header-files intended to be used in modules.
    • Functions externally visible to other kernel files (i. e. non `static` functions) («good practice»)
    • Functions marked `static` («recommendation»)

  Guidelines to documenting rust code is found in `Documentation/rust/general-information.rst`.

  Syntax and more for kernel-doc is described in `→ Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc_rst`.

{ The documentation TODO list

  → https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/doc-guide/contributing.rst[Documentation/doc-guide/contributing.rst] notes:
  "
    The documentation build currently spews out an unbelievable number of
    warnings. When you have that many, you might as well have none at all;
    people ignore them, and they will never notice when their work adds new
    ones. For this reason, eliminating warnings is one of the highest-priority
    tasks on the documentation TODO list.
  "

{ Log files of patches

? Apparently, some documentation of functionality can also be extracted from the log files that accompany a patch.

}
{ Non-typos that should not be fixed

  Both, American and British spelling is allowed.

  Off topic are debates such as if
    • a period must be followed by one or two spaces
    • the Oxford comma is allowed.
