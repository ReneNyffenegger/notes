$ Linux kernel sources: syscall.tbl files

`syscall.tbl` files contain *system call numbers* and *entry vectors* for a particular architecture.

These files contain tabulator separated values in the following format:
code {
<number>  <abi>  <name>  [<entry point>  [<compat entry point>]]
code }

For some architectures, the `syscall.tbl` file is found `→ Linux/kernel/source/arch/[arch/]…/kernel/syscalls`.
-
For `mips`, there is  a `syscall_n32.tbl`, `syscall_n64.tbl` and `syscall_o32.tbl` file.
-
For `arm` the file is under `…/tools/syscall.tbl`
-
For `x86`, there are two files: `syscall_64.tbl` and `syscall_32.tbl`.

In addition, some `.tbl` files are also found under `tools/perf/arch/…/entry/syscalls/….tbl`

It looks like these `syscall.tbl` files are processed by the three scripts `syscallhdr.sh`, `syscalltbl.sh` (and `syscallnr.sh`?), found under `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts`.
-
Files that are generated by `syscallhdr.sh` and `syscalltbl.sh` seem to include:
   • `arch/$SRCARCH/include/generated/asm/syscalls…{32,64}.h`
   • `arch/$SRCARCH/include/generated/uapi/asm/unistd_{32,64}.h`
   • … ?

{ TODO

? Apparently, some *syscall.tbl* files are used by several arch-dependend scripts named `mksyscalltbl` under `→ Linux/kernel/source/tools[tools]/perf` to generate «system call tables».

}

sa:
  there is also `scripts/atomic/atomics.tbl`.
