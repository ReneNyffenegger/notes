$ Linux kernel sources: Subsystems

The kernel sources are divided into subsystems according to their functionality.

{ Maintainers #linux-subsystem-maintainers

  A *maintainer* should be assigned to each subsystem.

  The maintainers are responsible for accepting a *patch* for the corresponding subsystem.

  When the *merge window* opens, the maintainers send selected patches to Linus Torvalds to merge them into the Linux kernel git repository.

  The maintainer for a source file can be obtained with `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/get_maintainer_pl`

{ Mentioning subsystems in patches

  Subsystems are often (and as I believe even required) to be mentioned in the subject line of a patch.

  The following git command shows the subject lines for the patches that modified a file in the kernel sources and demonstrates that they often
  refer to the same subsystem (the word left to the first colon):
