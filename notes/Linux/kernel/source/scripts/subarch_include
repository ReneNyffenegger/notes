$ scripts/subarch.include

`scripts/subarch.include` is included from the top-level `→ Linux/kernel/source/Makefile` (if not a so-called mixed-build) and
determines the value of `SUBARCH` (basically with a variation of `→ Linux/shell/commands/uname -m`)

`SUBARCH` tells the usermode build what the underlying arch is. That is set
first, and if a usermode build is happening, the `ARCH=um` on the command line
overrides the setting of ARCH below. If a native build is happening, then
`ARCH` is assigned, getting whatever value it gets normally, and `SUBARCH` is
subsequently ignored.

The value of `SUBARCH` is also used to set the value of `ARCH` if not overridden with → Linux/kernel/compilation/make#linux-make-ARCH[`make ARCH=…`].
