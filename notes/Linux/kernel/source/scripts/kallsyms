$ scripts/kallsyms

`scripts/kallsyms` is a binary that creates assembler source code that contains *symbol information* (see also → Linux/kernel/source#linux-kallsyms[kallsyms]) in compressed form.
-
In the context of the Linux kernel, the produced files are → Linux/kernel/source/_tmp_vmlinux_kallsymsN_S[`.tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms1.syms` and `.tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms2.syms`].

The compression ratio for kernel symbols is approximately 50%.

This binary is created from the source file `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts[scripts]/kallsyms.c`.

{ Usage

code {
kallsyms [--all-symbols] [--absolute-percpu] [--base-relative] [--lto-clang] in.map > out.S
code }

}

sa:

 `kallsyms` is called from the shell script function `kallsyms` in `→ Linux/kernel/source/scripts/link-vmlinux_sh`.
