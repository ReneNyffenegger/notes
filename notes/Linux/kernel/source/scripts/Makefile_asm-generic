$ scripts/Makefile.asm-generic

"
â†’ Linux/kernel/source/include/asm-generic[include/asm-generic/] contains a lot of files that are used
verbatim by several architectures.

This Makefile reads the file arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/(uapi/)/asm/Kbuild
and for each file listed in this file with generic-y creates
a small wrapper file in arch/$(SRCARCH)/include/generated/(uapi/)/asm.
