$ scripts/diffconfig

`scripts/diffconfig` is a utility for comparing two `.config` files.
-
Using standard `→ Linux/shell/commands/diff` to compare `.config` files often includes extraneous and distracting information. 

Compare using this script with
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/cp old.config .config
$ → Linux/kernel/compilation/make listnewconfig
code }
