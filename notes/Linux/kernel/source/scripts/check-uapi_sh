$ scripts/check-uapi.sh

`scripts/check-uapi.sh` is the *UAPI checker*.
-
This shell script checks UAPI header files for userspace backwards-compatibility across the git tree.

The intention is for this script to be used as a quick check for maintainers or
automated tooling, not as the end-all authority on patch compatibility. It's
best to remember: use your best judgment (and ideally a unit test in userspace)
to make sure your UAPI changes are backwards-compatible!

{ TODO

  Is this script related to `â†’ Linux/kernel/source/include/uapi`?
