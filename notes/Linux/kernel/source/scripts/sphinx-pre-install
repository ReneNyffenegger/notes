$ scripts/sphinx-pre-install

`scripts/sphinx-pre-install` is a → development/languages/Perl script that autotmatically checks for Sphinx dependencies.
-
By default, it checks all the requirements for both html and PDF, including
the requirements for images, math expressions and LaTeX build, and assumes
that a virtual Python environment will be used.
-
The ones needed for HTML builds are assumed to be mandatory; the others to be optional.

{ Options

  table { ll

  `--no-virtualenv` ☰ Use OS packaging for Sphinx instead of Python virtual environment.
  `--version-check` ☰ If version is compatible, don't check for missing dependencies
  `--no-pdf` ☰ Disable checks for PDF

  table }

}
{ Formulate commands to install required dependencies

  If the script recognizes the → Linux/distributions[distribution], it also helps to formulate the command to install
  the required dependencies:
code {
$ ~/linux ./scripts/sphinx-pre-install
Detected OS: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye).
Warning: better to also install "dvipng".
Warning: better to also install "latexmk".
Warning: better to also install "rsvg-convert".
Warning: better to also install "texlive-lang-chinese".
Warning: better to also install "xelatex".
You should run:

        sudo apt-get install dvipng latexmk librsvg2-bin texlive-lang-chinese texlive-xetex

Sphinx needs to be installed either:
1) via pip/pypi with:

        /usr/bin/python3 -m venv sphinx_2.4.4
        . sphinx_2.4.4/bin/activate
        pip install -r ./Documentation/sphinx/requirements.txt

    If you want to exit the virtualenv, you can use:
        deactivate

2) As a package with:

        sudo apt-get install python3-sphinx
  …
code }

  After installing the suggested pacakges and software:
code {
$ ~/linux ./scripts/sphinx-pre-install
Detected OS: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye).
Sphinx version: 3.4.3


All optional dependencies are met.
Needed package dependencies are met.
code }

}
