{ Generic interrupt handling layer #generic-interrupt-handling-layer

  The generic interrupt handling layer provides an abstraction of interrupt handling for → Linux/kernel/drivers[device drivers].

  The drivers do not have to know anything about interrupt hardware details, so they can be used on different
  platforms without code changes.

  See → Linux/kernel/source/Documentation/DocBook/genericirq_tmpl

}

{ Mutexes

  → Linux/kernel/locks/mutex[Mutexes] may not be used in hard- or software
  interrupt contexts such as tasklets and timers.

}

{ TODO

 `kstat_irqs` (in → Linux/kernel/source/kernel/irq/irqdesc_c) returns the sum of interrupt counts on
  all cpus since boot for a specific irq.
