DWARF was originally developped in combination with → Linux/ELF on Unix related operating systems, but has since attempted to be an independent from a given OS or object file format.

{ The seven dwarves

  The → https://landley.net/kdocs/ols/2007/ols2007v2-pages-35-44.pdf[7 dwarves] are tools that consume DWARF debugging information. These tools are
  table { ll
   →  Linux/ELF/DWARF/7/pahole[`pahole`] ☰ Examine `struct` layout. This is the most advanced dwarf.
   `pfunct` ☰ Examine executable code characteristics
   `codiff` ☰ Compare executables
   `ctracer` ☰ Trace execution of functions associated with a `struct`
   `pdwtabs` ☰ Pretty-print DWARF information
   `pgloban` ☰ List global symbols
   `prefcnt` ☰ Count the number of times each set of tags is used
  table }

  All these tools use the `libdwarves` library.

? The Linux kernel configuration symbol `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO`  causes the kernel to be built with DWARF information.
