`init` is called by the → Linux/kernel[kernel] when it has finished its → Linux/kernel/boot-process[booting sequence] (See → Linux/kernel/source/init/main_c)

`init` is the parent of *all* → Linux/kernel/process[processes].

{ Init process

  Init takes a parameter: the *→Linux/runlevel* (1-6). 

  The «root» of all processes. Almost all → Linux/daemons are spawned by init.

  After setting everthing up, init goes to sleep and is only woken up
    • when process has ended
    • a power failure signal was detected
    • the runlevel is changed with `/sbin/telnit`

  The init process runs in user space.

}
{ Run levels #system-v-run-levels

  • S: Not really meant to be used directly. It's apparently used in conjunction with the action `sysinit` in order to go to runlevel 1 or more.
  • 0: halt
  • 1: Single user mode
  • 2: Multi user, without networking (→ Linux/filesystem/NFS[NFS]) and GUI.
  • 3: Full multi user mode, but still no GUI
  • 4: user definable / undefined
  • 5: Full multi user with → Linux/X/display-manager[display manager]
  • 6: reboot.

  The runlevels are controlled via the → Linux/fhs/etc/inittab file.

  They determine which sub systems to run.

  The runlevel is changed with `/sbin/telnit`.

  Some systems also have runlevels 7-9.

  Apparently runlevels `S` and `s` are synonyms.

  The source code of `init` also talks about the fake run levels `#` for *SYSINIT* and `*` for *BOOT* and *BOOTWAIT*.

}
{ Configuration

  The top level configuration file is → Linux/fhs/etc/inittab.
  

}
{ Init scripts #init-scripts

  An *init script* requires an ~action~ (which is passed as a string to the script) which is one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *try-restart*, *reload*, *force-reload* or *status*.

  Apparently, an init script is supposed to source → Linux/fhs/lib/lsb/init-functions.

  Init scripts are located in `/etc/rc*`.

  When `init` starts a new process, it first checks whether the script → Linux/fhs/etc/initscript[`/etc/initscript`] is available. If so, this script is used to start the process.

}
{ Boot process #boot-process

  The first script that is called in the boot process is → Linux/fhs/etc/rc_d/init_d/rc.

  The boot process can be somewhat configured in → Linux/fhs/etc/sysconfig/rc_site

}

sa:

  → Linux/init/systemd

  → Linux/fhs/dev/initctl

  → Linux/fhs/etc/sysconfig/rc_site
