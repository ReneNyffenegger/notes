{ Init process

  Init takes a parameter: the *→Linux/runlevel* (1-6). 

  The «root» of all processes. Almost all → Linux/daemons are spawned by init.

  After setting everthing up, init goes to sleep and is only woken up
    • when process has ended
    • a poer failure signal was detected
    • the runlevel is changed with `/sbin/telnit`

  The init process runs in user space.

}
{ Run levels

  • 0: halt
  • 1: Single user mode
  • 2: Multi user, without networking
  • 3: Full multi user mode
  • 4: user definable
  • 5: Full multi user with → Linux/X/display-manager[display manager]
  • 6: reboot.

  The runlevels are controlled via the → Linux/fhs/etc/inittab file.

}
{ Configuration

  The top level configuration file is → Linux/fhs/etc/inittab.
  

}
{ Init scripts #init-scripts

  An *init script* requires an ~action~ (which is passed as a string to the script) which is one of *start*, *stop*, *restart*, *try-restart*, *reload*, *force-reload* or *status*.

  Apparently, an init script is supposed to source → Linux/fhs/lib/lsb/init-functions.

  Init scripts are located in `/etc/rc*`.

}
{ Boot process #boot-process

  The first script that is called in the boot process is → Linux/fhs/etc/rc_d/init_d/rc.

  The boot process can be somewhat configured in → Linux/fhs/etc/sysconfig/rc_site

}

sa:

  → Linux/init/systemd
