{ Services

  Start, stop and restart service named svcxyz:
code {
$ /etc/init.d/svcxyz start
$ /etc/init.d/svcxyz stop
$ /etc/init.d/svcxyz restart
code }

  Is this the same as … ?
code {
$ rc-service svcxyz start
code }

  { Init scripts

    Init scripts are somewhat similar to sysvinit scripts used in sysvinit. However, some several simplify their creation.

    The initscript for the service named `svcxyz` is `/etc/init.d/svcxyz`.

 ?  Init scripts are apparently interpreted by `openrc-run`.

  }
  { Configuration file

    The configuration file for the init script `/etc/init.d/svcxyz` is `/etc/conf.d/svcxyz`.

  }

}
{ TODO

code {
$ rc-status
code }

 The files under `{/mnt/livecd,}/lib/rc/sh/`

}

sa:

 `/etc/rc.conf` stores the *global OpenRC configruation settings.


? `/var/log/rc.log` is the default log file.

  The runlevels under `/etc/runlevels` have symlinks to the actual init scripts.

 `/lib/rc/sh/openrc-run.sh` (in a live cd located under `/mnt/livecd/…`) is a shell warapper for `openrc-run`.
