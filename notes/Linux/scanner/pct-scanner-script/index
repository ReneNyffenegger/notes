$ pct-scanner-script

`pct-scanner-script` is a bash script (with configuration facility) that drives → Linux/scanner/scanadf, DjVu and PDF tools to create DjVu
and → design/graphic/pdf/index[PDF] output from a → Linux/scanner.

It's quite clumsy in handling it and does not produce what you want.

Apparently, it does not support OCR!


code {
$ psct-scanner-script -c --device epkowa:net:192.168.1.102 --source Flatbed -o ~/scanner/output
code }

{ --search #search

  `-a` is a synonym for `--search`.
