D-Bus = Desktop Bus. The Desktop Bus allows applications to talk to one another (IPC and RPC). It is non-transactional, stafeful and conection based.
-
Originally, D-Bus was created to replace the CORBA-like component model underlying the → Linux/GUI/GNOME[GNOME] desktop environment.

D-Bus is simalr to DCOP which is used by → Linux/GUI/KDE.

{  Major components

   There are two major components to D-Bus:
     • A *dbus library* to exchange messages among processes
     • *dbus → Linux/daemons[daemons]* which run busses.

    A *dbus daemon* is started via `dbus-launch`.

    Usually, two bus daemons are running
      • the *system bus* and
      • the *session bus*

    The *system bus* reports events such as a new → hardware/device or changes in some status.

    The *session bus* is the bus over which applications communicate.



}
{ Objects

  An object is participant of the communcation (an endpoint).

  The bus itself is also an object.

  Wkithin the D-Bus, objects are uniquely iedentified by
    • bus name and
    • object path

  The *bus name* identifies a client application that is connected to the bus. Apparently, bus names start with a colon (as in `:1.128`) or have a *well known* name
  (such as `com.foobar.Application`).

  The *object path* identifies an object *within* that application.
  -
  The path looks like a standard Unix file system path (but conisists fo letters, numbers, underscores and forward slashes only).

  The bus itself is identified by an address.

}
{ Bindings

  A *binding* is an interface to a specific → development/languages[programming language].
  

}
{ Configuration files

  → Linux/fhs/etc/dbus-1/system_conf (for the system bus) and
  → Linux/fhs/etc/dbus-1/session_conf (for the session bus), which apparently are both deprecated or obsoleted.

  → Linux/fhs/etc/dbus-1/system_d

  → Linux/fhs/usr/share/dbus-1/session_conf controls the per-user-login-session message bus.

  → Linux/fhs/usr/share/dbus-1/system_conf

{ TODO

  { dbus-launch

    A ~session bus instance~ is started with `dbus-launch`.

    Examples:
code {
dbus-launch --exit-with-session openbox
code }

  }
