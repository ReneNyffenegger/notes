"
  In Linux there are two potential sources of kernel log information: the → Linux/fhs/proc
  file system and the → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[syscall] `sys_syslog` interface, although ultimately they
  are one and the same. → Linux/logging/klogd[Klogd] is designed to choose whichever source of
  information is the most appropriate. It does this by first checking for the
  presence of a mounted /proc file system. If this is found the → Linux/fhs/proc/kmsg file
  is used as the source of kernel log information. If the proc file system is
  not mounted klogd uses a system call to obtain kernel messages
