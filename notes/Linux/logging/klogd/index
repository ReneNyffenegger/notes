The klogd → Linux/daemons[daemon] listens to → Linux/kernel[kernel] message sources and is responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system messages.

klogd is run as a client of → Linux/syslogd[syslogd] or optionally as a standalone program.

Klogd can be used to decode EIP addresses if it can determine a → Linux/fhs/boot/System_map[System.map] file. 

{ Reading kernel messages

  After a → Linux/kernel/boot-process[system boot], the kernel messages might be dumped into a file with
code {
klogd -o -f /tmp/kmsg
code }

}
{ Maintenance

  It seems that *Martin Schulze* took over maintenance, see also → http://www.infodrom.org/projects/sysklogd/.
