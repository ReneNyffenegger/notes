TTY is the abbrevation of *teletypewriter*. Originally, a TTY was physically connected to a Unix machine as an input/output device.
-
Later, also serial port connections were referred to as TTYs.


{ Terminal devices

  A TTY (or terminal) device is a special class of a → Linux/devices#character-devices[character device].

  A Terminal device might act as a *controlling terminal* for a session, such as
    • virtual consoles
    • serial prots
    • → development/misc/pseudo-terminal (PTYs)

  All registered TTY devices that are present in the → Linux/kernel are found under → Linux/fhs/sys/class/tty.

  The most important *data structure* to implement a TTY driver is the struct `tty_driver` which is found in → Linux/kernel/source/include/linux/tty_driver_h.

}
{ Flip buffer

  A *flip buffer* contains two input buffers. One buffer is used to store data from the TTY while the user reads from the other buffer.
  
  These buffers *flip* their role when the input-buffer becomes full or the user flushes it.


}
{ TODO

  VT (as in VT100) stands for *video terminal* (as opposed to the paper based TTYs).
