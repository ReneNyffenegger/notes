The man pages are located in →Linux/fhs/usr/share/man/index

*Man pages* are the historical and well known way way on Unix for documentation. In a
→ Linux/shell[shell], a man page is accessed through the → Linux/shell/commands/man[`man`] command.

Some conventions for writing man pages are found using
code {
$ → Linux/shell/commands/man[man] 7 man-pages
code }

{ Finding all man pages

  `apropos .`, `man -k .`, `whatis -r .`

}
{ Structures of man pages #man-structure

  Usually, man pages have a variation of the following section headers:
    • NAME
    • SYNOPSIS
    • DESCRIPTION
    • SEE ALSO
    • BUGS
    • AUTHOR

  Compare with the → development/languages/Perl/POD#perl-pod-recommended-order[Recommended order of sections] in a → development/languages/Perl/POD[Perl POD (Plain Old Documentation] file.

  In a `groff` input file, section headers are created with the `.SH` directive.

  An simple nroff file with the structure:
  gh|about-man-pages|/examples/structure||


 
}
{ Comments and new lines

  In a roff source, a *comment* is introduced with `\"`. However, this won't remove the new line which
  will cause a new paragraph in the output.
  
  Therefore, comments that span an entire line and need to be completely removed while parsing, a
  comment usually is introduced with a leading dot: `.\"` which is interpreted as an undefined
  request.

  Consider:
  gh|about-man-pages|/examples/comments-and-new-lines||

  If run through → Linux/shell/commands/man[`man`], it produces:
code {
line one

line two

line three line four
code }

}
