$ Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
@ ALSA


ALSA deprecated → Linux/sound/OSS with Linux 2.6 since when ALSA is Linux' default sound system.

ALSA is used in frameworks such as → Linux/sound/JACK or → Linux/sound/PulseAudio.

{ Configuring

  → Linux/fhs/usr/share/alsa/alsa_conf is the main entry point for configuring the ALSA system.

  → Linux/fhs/home/username/_asoundrc

}
{ Plugins

  ALSA consists plugins.
  
  The *hw* plugin does not processing, it accesses the hardware driver.

  The *plug* plugin performs channel duplication, sample value conversion and resampling (when necessary because not supported by the hardware).

  The *file* plugin writes sample data to a file.

}
{ Cards, devices, subdevices, interfaces

  { Cards

    A card is either a *physical or logical* kernel device that is albe to record, process or emit sound.

    ALSA counts up to eight *cards*, numbered from 0 to 7 or alternatively identified by an *ID*.

  }
  { Devices

    Each card has devices whose numbers again start with 0.

    These devices have a specific kind such as
      • playback
      • capture
      • control
      • timer
      • sequencer

    The device »level« is where most of the hardware access takes place.

  }
  { Subdevices

    A device might have *subdevices*.

    A subdevice, if available, specifies a sound end point.

  }
  { Interfaces

    An interface specifies an asla protocl to a card/device/subdevice triple.

    An interface string thus might look like `interface:CARD=0,DEV=1,SUBDEV=1`.


  }

}
{ Utilities

  `alsactl` allows to save settings for a device.

  `amixer` to make adjustments to devices volume and sound controls.

  `alsamixer` is the → Linux/ncurses version of `amixer`.

  `acconnect` and `aseqview` to make midi connections and view the list of connected ports.

  `aplay` plays back a sound file.

  `arecord` records a sound file.

  `alsaconf`

}
