{ Keyboard mapping

  { Components

    A keyboard mapping consists of some components:

    { Keycodes #keyboard-mapping-keycode

      Specifies the range and interpretation of the raw keycodes reported by the device.
      
      It sets the keycodes
      *symbolic name*, the minimum and maximum legal codes for the keyboard, and the
      *symbolic name* for each key. The keycodes component might also contain aliases
      for some keys, symbolic names for some indicators and a description of which
      indicators are physically present.

    }
    { Geometry #keyboard-mapping-geometry
      
      Specifies the geometry of a keyboard.

      It might contain ~aliases~ for some keys, or symbolic names for
      some indicators and might affect the set of indicators that
      are physically present.
      
      Key aliases defined in the geometry component of a
      keyboard mapping override those defined in the →#keyboard-mapping-keycode[keycodes] component.

    }
    { Types #keyboard-mapping-type

       Specifies the key types that can be associated with the various keyboard keys.
       
       The types component can optionally contain also real modifier bindings
       and symbolic names for one or more virtual modifiers.
