`startx` is a shell script that that gathers the arguments to finally execute → Linux/X/xinit[`xinit`].

The default `startx` script (in → Linux/fhs/usr/bin) has the following note:
"
  This is just a sample implementation of a slightly less primitive
  interface than xinit. It looks for user .xinitrc and .xserverrc
  files, then system xinitrc and xserverrc files, else lets xinit choose
  its default. The system xinitrc should probably do things like check
  for .Xresources files and merge them in, start up a window manager,
  and pop a clock and several xterms.
  
  Site administrators are STRONGLY urged to write nicer versions.
