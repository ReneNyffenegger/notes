  { Display server (=X Server?)

    Responsible for the *graphical environment*.

    Implementations: Xorg (which is the popular in the → Linux community), XFree86 and X11.

    An *X Server* implements *X11* (a network protocol)

    The X Server is responsible for
      • managing resources
      • processing drawing requests
      • dispatching events (keyboard, mouse etc)
    

  }
  { Display manager #x-display-manager
   
    If the system starts up, this is the first program (after running the display server?)
    -
    The → Linux/X/display-manager[display manager] allows a user to login in (hence, the display manager is also known as »login manager«).
    -
    When the user is logged in, the display manager starts an X-Session.


  }
  { Window manager #x-window-manager

    todo: moved to → Linux/X/window-manager


  }
  { Desktop environment

    A → Linux/X/desktop-environment[desktop environment] tries to create a consistent experience for the user. Thus, it ships with a set of applications that are
    all written using a common widget toolkit and set of libraries.

{ Starting X

  X is usually started with → Linux/X/xinit.

{ VcXsrv

  I don't like installers, therefore, I want to extract the content of the VcXsrv installer. First, the installer is downloaded to `~/Downloads`. Then:
code {
$ mkdir  /mnt/c/Users/Rene/vcxsrv
$ 7z x -o/mnt/c/Users/Rene/vcxsrv vcxsrv-64.1.20.14.0.installer.exe
code }

  Adding the address of the connecting client to `C:\Users\Rene\vcxsrv\X0.hosts` (in order to prevent the *Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified* error message
  when starting an X client.

  Then: start the server
code {
C:\users\rene\vcxsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl
code }
 
  Unblock the firewall to allow x-clients to connect to VcXsrv:
code {
PS C:\> get-netFirewallRule -displayName vcxsrv.exe
PS C:\> set-netFirewallRule -displayName vcxsrv.exe -action allow
code }

  Now, on the Linux side (192.168.0.89 is the Address of the Windows Machine whre VcXsrv is running):
code {
$ export DISPLAY=192.168.0.89:0
$ xterm
code }
