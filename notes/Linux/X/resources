$ X resources

An *X resource* is a key value pair that is stored with the X server. For the X server, the value is meaningless - it's up to the clients to parse and understand it.
-
Usually, such values are used to tune the appearance of client applications: colors, fonts, cursors, themes etc.

{ Format

  The format for an X resource is.
code {
application.component.subcomponent.subcomponent.attribute: value
code }
or
code {
name.class.resource: value
code }

   The first part (`application … attribute`) is the key.

}
{ xrdb

  Resources are managesd with the xrdb program.

  A resource file (for example → Linux/fhs/home/username/_Xresources) is loaded with `xrdb resource-file` (usually `xrdb ~/.Xresources`). This gets rid of the old
  resources and replaces them with the new set.

  In order not to get rid of old resources, `xrdb -merge resource-file` should be used.

  The X resources currently being in effect can be queried with `xrdb -query`.

}

sa:
  → Linux/fhs/home/username/_Xresources
