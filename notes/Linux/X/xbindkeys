xbindkeys allows to define keyboard-shortcuts to execute (or start) applications.

Such shortcuts can either be stored in → Linux/fhs/home/username/_xbindkeysrc or somehow made within the gui (`xbindkeys_config`?).
-
After adding a shortcut, the configuration file can/must be reloaded with `xbindkeys -p`.

A → Linux/X/XKB/database#keycodes[keycode] can be identified with `xbindkeys -k`

  → Linux/X
