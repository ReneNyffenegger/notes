$ XKB database

The XKB database has five components:

{ Keycodes #keycodes

  Keycode tables define *symbolic names* for → hardware/keyboard#scancode[scancodes].

  Apparently, a keycode can be identified with the `-k` flag of `→ Linux/X/xbindkeys`.

  s.a. `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes`

}
{ Types #types

  A key has a type (ALPHABETIC (letters) or ONE_LEVEL (Enter))

  s.a. `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/X11/xkb/types`

}
{ Compat #compat

  s.a. `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/X11/xkb/compat`

}
{ Symbols #symbols

  Map scancodes (whose symbolic values are defined in →#keycodes[keycodes]) to all possible symbols (the number of which depends on →#types[types]).
  -
  The different symbols are »reached« by using different → hardware/keyboard#modifier-keys[modifier keys].

  s.a. `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols`

}
{ Geometry #geometry

  Where is which key on the → hardware/keyboard

  s.a. `→ Linux/fhs/usr/share/X11/xkb/geometry`
}
