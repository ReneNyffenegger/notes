§offb-1-10: *am Tag des HERRN* (ἐν τῇ κυριακῇ ἡμέρᾳ): gem. RL besser übersetzt als «dem Herrn gehörenden Tag». (κυριακός, Strongs 2960, 2x, ist ein Adjektiv). Vgl. §1kor-11-20

    John was given this vision ἐν τῇ κυριακῇ ἡμέρᾳ (*en tē kyriakē hēmera*, on the Lord’s Day), a phrase found only
    here in the NT. Three options have been suggested for
    its meaning: (1) It may be a reference to the
    eschatological day of the Lord, so that John is
    transported to the time of the eschaton (so Bullinger
    1909: 12; Walvoord 1966: 42); but neither the language
    here nor the contents of 1:12—20 make that likely, for
    the NT commonly uses the genitive Kupiov (kyriou,
    Lord’s) to designate the “day of the Lord,” while John
    here has the adjective. (2) It may refer to Easter Sunday
    as the day of the parousia within the confines of Easter
    liturgy (M. Shepherd 1960; Strand 1966—67); but this is
    highly speculative, and this view did not arise until at
    least a century later. (3) Most likely this phrase refers
    to Sunday, chosen by the early church on the basis of
    the resurrection as the day of worship (Stott 1965—66;
    Bauckham 1982: 221—50). Stott (73—74) argues that
    κυριακῇ was originally associated with the resurrection
    and then with the eschatological triumph of the Lord
    of lords and thereby came to be used of the “Lord’s
    Day.” It is likely that the Jewish-Christian church
    worshiped in the synagogues on the Jewish Sabbath and
    in their own assemblies from the earliest times on
    Sunday, celebrating the Eucharist and worshiping
    Christ together (cf. Acts 2:42). While this is the first
    appearance of “the Lord’s Day” as a technical term for
    Sunday worship, it became a common term for such in
    the second century. John was worshiping on that day
    and received this vision.
