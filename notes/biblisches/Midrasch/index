{ Adam Clarks Einschätzung

  Adam Clark schreibt:
  "
   The Jewish philosophy, such as is found the Cabala, Midrashim, and other
   works, deserves the character of vain deceit, in the fullest sense and
   meaning of the words. The inspired writers excepted, the Jews have ever been
   the most puerile, absurd, and ridiculous reasoners in the world. Even Rabbi
   Maimon or Maimonides, the most intelligent of them all, is often, in his
   master-piece, the Moreh Neochim, the teacher of the perplexed, most
   deplorably empty and vain.
  " [ 1831, VI, p. 486 ]
