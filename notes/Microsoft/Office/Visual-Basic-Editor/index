$ Microsoft Office: Visual Basic Editor
@ visual basic editor

`Alt+F11` takes one from an → Microsoft/Office[Office application] to the *visual basic editor*.

From the visual basic editor, the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window[immediate window] can be opened with `Ctrl-G`.

{ Renaming modules

  Apparently, code modules cannot be renamed with a right mouse click. Instead. the module needs to be selected and its name then
  changed in the properties window in the lower left corner.

}
{ Module name equal to sub name

  It seems that some problems might be caused if the name of a module is equal to the name of a sub. When the sub is called from the
  → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window/index[immediate window] with `call subName`, it causes
  the »compile error« *Expected variable or procedure, not module*.

  This »problem« can be circumvented by qualifying the sub name: `call equalName.equalName`
