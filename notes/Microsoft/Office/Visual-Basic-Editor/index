$ Microsoft Office: Visual Basic Editor
@ Visual Basic Editor


{ Keyboard shortcuts

  `Alt+F11` takes one from an → Microsoft/Office[Office application] to the *Visual Basic Editor*.

  From the Visual Basic Editor, the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window[immediate window] can be opened with `Ctrl-G`.

  The → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Browser is opened with `F2`.

}
{ Renaming modules

  Apparently, code modules cannot be renamed with a right mouse click. Instead. the module needs to be selected and its name then
  changed in the properties window in the lower left corner.

}
{ Module name equal to sub name

  It seems that some problems might be caused if the name of a module is equal to the name of a sub. When the sub is called from the
  → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window/index[immediate window] with `call subName`, it causes
  the »compile error« *Expected variable or procedure, not module*.

  This «problem» can be circumvented by qualifying the sub name: `call equalName.equalName`

}
{ Jumping to the definition of a sub or function

  At least in → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel], it's possible to jump to the definition of a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub or function] using
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/goto[`application.goto …`] by giving it the name of the sub or procedure.
  
code {
application.goto "nameOfSub", scroll = true
code }

}

{ Opening VB Editor with VBA

code {
→ Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/CommandBars/executeMso[application.commandBars.executeMso] "VisualBasic"
code }

  { Automatically opening the VB Editor when an Office App is started
  
    In order to have the VB editor automatically opened when → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] is started, the following macro can be used (Apparently, in
    → Microsoft/Office/Word[Word], `AutoOpen` rather than `auto_open` is needed). (*2019-09-11*: I was just informed that these two events are obsolete).
  code {
  sub auto_open()
    application.vbe.mainWindow.visible = true
  end sub
  code }
  
  }

}
