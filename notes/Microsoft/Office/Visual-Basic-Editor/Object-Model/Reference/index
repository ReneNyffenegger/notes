$ VB Editor Object Model: Reference

{ Two types of reference

  A `Reference` object references either
     • → Windows/development/COM/type-library or
     • another → development/languages/VBA#vba-project[VBA project] (that is set of → development/languages/VBA/language/module[modules]).

  Thus, adding references to VBA project extends the available functionality for the project with the functionality that is found in the TypeLib or the other project.

  The type of a `reference` object is exposed in its `.type` property which is assigned one of the two following enumeration values
    • `vbext_rk_typeLib` (= 0)
    • `vbext_rk_project` (= 1)

}
{ Adding a reference #VBIDE-add-reference

  A `Reference` object can be added using the `References` collection:
code {
….references.addFromGUID(→ development/UUID-GUID[guid], major, minor)
code }

  `guid` refers to a GUID found in the → Windows/registry[registry] under the → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/TypeLib[`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib`].

}
