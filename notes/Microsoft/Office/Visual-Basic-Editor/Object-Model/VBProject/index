$ VB Editor Object Model: VBProject

{ Relationship to Office documents

  There is usually (always?) a one to one relationship between an → Microsoft/Office file (or document such as a word document or an
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Excel workbook]) and its corresponding `vbProject` object.
  -
  For example, the `vbProject` of a workbook can be found with an expression like
code {
? activeWorkbook.vbproject.name
code }


}
{ Container for code and forms

  A `vbProject` object is a container for all → development/languages/VBA[VBA] code and forms within the Office document that stores it. These items are referred to as «components» and might be referenced with an expression like
code {
? activeWorkbook.vbproject.vbComponents…
code }

}
