{ Relationship to Office documents

  There is usually (always?) a one to one relationship between an → Microsoft/Office file (or document such as a word document or an
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Excel workbook]) and its corresponding `vbProject` object.
  -
  For example, the `vbProject` of a workbook can be found with an expression like
code {
? activeWorkbook.vbproject.name
code }


}
{ Container for code and forms

  A `vbProject` object is a container for all → development/languages/VBA[VBA] code and forms within the Office document that stores it. These items are referred to as «components» and might be referenced with an expression like
code {
? activeWorkbook.vbproject.→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBComponent[vbComponents]…
code }

}
{ Adding references to a VBA project #vbProject-add-reference

  A → development/languages/VBA#vba-project[VBA project] can use the functionality of another VBA project by adding a → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference[`reference`] to the project from which it wants to import
  the desired functionality.
