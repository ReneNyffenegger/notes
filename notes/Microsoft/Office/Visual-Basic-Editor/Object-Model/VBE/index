$ VB Editor Object Model: VBE

`VBE` is the *root object* of the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model[VB Editor Object model]: it contains all other objects and collections

In most Office applications, this object can be referred to via `application.vbe`. A notebale exception is → Microsoft/Office/Outlook/Object-Model[Outlook's object model] which, probably for security
reasons, does not allow to refer to this object.
