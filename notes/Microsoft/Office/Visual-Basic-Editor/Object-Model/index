{ Adding a reference to a library programmatically

  The programmatical equivalent of *Tools -> References -> …. * is to use the `VBProject.references` object.

  The object that needs to be added is represented by  GUID. The GUID in the following example represents
  the *Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3* library.


In → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel]:
code {
thisWorkbook.VBProject.references.addFromGuid _
        GUID   :="{0002E157-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}", _
        major  :=  5,                                      _
        minor  :=  3
code }

In → Microsoft/Office/Word[Word], `thisWorkbook` needs to be changed to `thisDocument`
