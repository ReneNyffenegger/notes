$ Visual Basic Editor: Object Browser 
@ Object Browser

The *Object Browser* allows to inspect the available objects in a → development/languages/VBA[VBA] project.
-
The information that the Object Browser displays is found in → Windows/development/COM/type-library[type libraries].

The *Object Browser* is started from the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor by pressing `F2` (or alternatively using the manu: View -> Object Browser)

By default, the Object Browser does not show hidden objects (such as for example Excel `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Global` object). In order to see them, *Show Hidden Members* must be chosen
with a right click.
