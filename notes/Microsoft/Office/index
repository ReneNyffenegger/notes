  a an *uninstall support tool* (= `o15-ctrremove.diagcab`?) that *Completely uninstalls Office* (because, apparently, the ordinary software deinstallation of Microsoft at time cannot do that)

{ Pain Points

  The ease with which Excel can be used also comes with a a huge risk: Companies might have hundreds or thousands of Excel-based applications and reports lurking on a company drive or file shares. Without proper managment and
  adminsitration, it is almost impossible to audit data access and guarantee compliance regulations promulgated by Sarbanes-Oxley 404, the National
  Association of Insurance Commissioners Model Audit Rule, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Financial Services Authority, Solvency II, Basel II, MFID etc.

  With the sheer number of Excel sheets, companies also have to face the reality of potential or incurred financial losses.
