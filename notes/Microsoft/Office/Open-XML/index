$ Microsoft Office Open XML

*Office Open XML* is also known as *OpenXML* or *OOXML*.

*Office Open XML* is the default format for all → Microsoft/Office[MS Office] documents.

*Office Open XML* is not the same as *Open Office XML* or the *Open Document Format* (ODF).

An Office Open → development/XML/DOM/nodes/document is basically a → Linux/shell/commands/zip[zipped] → development/archive-files[archive] of a few
→ development/XML documents.

  { VBA macros/source code

    → development/languages/VBA[VBA] macros (and or source code?) are apparently not stored in an XML file, but in a binary file
    called `vbaProject.bin` (`vbaProject.bin` seems to be the default name; the name can be changed in `…/_rels/document.xml.rels`).

    This `vbaProject.bin` file is an *OLE compound file* in binary format.
