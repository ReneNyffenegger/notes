  { VBA macros/source code

    → development/languages/VBA[VBA] macros (and or source code?) is apparently not stored in an XML file, but in a binary file
    called `vbaProject.bin` (`vbaProject.bin` seems to be the default name; the name can be changed in `…/_rels/document.xml.rels`).

    This `vbaProject.bin` file is an *OLE compound file* in binary format.
