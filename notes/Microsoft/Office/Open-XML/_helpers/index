  `office_zip.pl` creates an → Microsoft/Office/Open-XML[Office Open XML] document from a set of → development/XML documents that are stored in a specific directory.

  `office_zip.pl` is executed in a command line as follows:
code {
office_zip.pl path/to/xml/root docx
code }

The suffix (in the previous example `docx`) might as well be `xlsx`.
