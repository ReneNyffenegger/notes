$ Access: Exporting Data to Excel 

The following → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application] functions attempt to demonstrate how the data of an
→ development/databases/Access[Access database] can be exported into → Microsoft/Office/Excel. The interesting function is
→ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DoCmd/transfer[`DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet`].

After exporting the data, the first row of the exported Excel worksheet is fixed so that it acts as header (and so that the column names are always visible when scrolling down).
