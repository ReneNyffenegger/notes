$ Access: DoCmd.SetOrderBy

`DoCmd.SetOrderBy` specifies the columns whose values specify the order of records (sort) in the table, form, report or datasheet that is active and has the focus.

Sort by (ascending) `articleId`:
code {
doCmd.SetOrderBy "articleId"
code }

Sort by multiple columns (`reportYear` and `reportMonth`):
code {
doCmd.SetOrderBy "reportYear, reportMonth"
code }

`setOrderBy` understands the `desc` key word (which reverses sort order):
code {
doCmd.setOrderBy "eventDate desc"
code }
