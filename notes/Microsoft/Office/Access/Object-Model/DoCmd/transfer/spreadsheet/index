$ Access: DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet

All parameters are optional:
code {
DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet (TransferType, SpreadsheetType, TableName, FileName, HasFieldNames, Range, UseOA)
code }

`TransferType` is either `acExport`, `acImport` or `acLink`, the default is `acImport`.

`SpreadsheetType` is a member of the → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/access.acspreadsheettype[`acSpreadsheetType` enumeration]. In the year 2022, in most cases, I think,
`acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12Xml` will be used.

If `HasFieldNames` defaults to `false`. With `true` when importing a spreadsheet, it is assumed to have a header row with the column names, when exporting, such a header row will be created.

`Range` is only used when importing data and specifies the source range from where data is imported.

The value of `UseOA` is not supported.
