$ Access: DoCmd.Transfer… methods

There are a few `transfer…` commands that allow to export and import → development/Data from/to → development/databases/Access:
  • `transferDatabase`
  • `transferSharePointList`
  • → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DoCmd/transfer/spreadsheet[`transferSpreadsheet`]
  • `transferSQLDatabase`
  • `transferText`

Under the hood, these methods use *Microsoft Access database engine* for the export and import, see
→ development/databases/OLE-DB/provider/Microsoft-Access-database-engine.

A → development/languages/VBA example that demonstrates `DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet` is → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/tests/export/excel-with-header[here].

Compare these methods with `DoCmd.OutputTo …`.
