$ Access Object Model: DoCmd

{ runSQL

 `runSQL` executes an → development/databases/Access/SQL[SQL statement].

  { Suppress «You are about to append … row(s)» #runSQL-you-are-about

    If `runSQL` is used to execute an insert statement, by default, Access pops up a message box with a *You are bout to append … row(s)* message:
    gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Access/DoCmd/img/You-are-about-to-append-1-row.png||

    In order to stop Access from displaying this message box, → #doCmd-setWarnings[`doCmd.setWarnings false`] must be executed beforehand.

  }
  { create view statement not supported

    `runSQL` cannot be used to create views.

  }

}
{ setFilter

  ? Remove the filter on the currently shown table:
code {
doCmd.setFilter ""
code }

}
{ setWarnings #doCmd-setWarnings

 `setWarnings false` might be executed to the → #runSQL-you-are-about[You are about to append … row(s)] message box.

  Compare with → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Application#ms-object-model-application-displayAlerts[`application.displayAlerts`]

}
{ transfer…

  There are a few `transfer…` commands that allow to export and import → development/Data from/to → development/databases/Access:
    • `transferDatabase`
    • `transferSharePointList`
    • `transferSpreadsheet`
    • `transferSQLDatabase`
    • `transferText`

  Under the hood, these methods use *Microsoft Access database engine* for the export and import, see
  → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider/Microsoft-Access-database-engine.

  Compare these methods with `doCmd.outputTo …`.
