$ DAO Object Model: Workspace

A workspace can be thought of as a *session*. Each workspace (session) can have independent and simultaneous transactions.


{ Automatic creation of the default workspace

  The first time a workspace is needed, DAO automatically creates a *default workspace*: `→ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DBEngine[dbEngine].workspaces(0)`.

}
