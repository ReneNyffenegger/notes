$ Access Object Model: Application

{ createXXXX #access-createXXXX

 `createXXXX` creates an object whose type is `xxxx`, for example a → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Form[form].


}
{ createControl #access-createControl

  The second parameter specifies the → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/access.accontroltype[type of the control] (for example *check box*, *image*, *object frame* etc.)

}
{ currentDb #access-currentDb

  `application.currentDb()` returns the → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Database[database] object that represents the currently opened `accdb` file in Access.

   The database pointed at with `currentDb()` can also be found via → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DBEngine#dbengine-find-currentDB[`dbEngine`].

}
{ (No) path

  The `application` object of access does not have a `path` property like the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[`application` object of Excel] or
  → Microsoft/Office/Word/Object-Model/Application[Word] that reveals the path and name of thee executable of the Office application.

  However, it is possible to get the installation directory of MS Access with
code {
debug.print sysCmd(acSysCmdAccessDir)
code }

}
sa:

  → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model

  → Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/Application
