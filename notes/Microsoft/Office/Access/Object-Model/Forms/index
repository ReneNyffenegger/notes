$ Access Object Model: Forms

`Forms` is the collection of *open* → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Form[forms]. The collection of all Forms (wheather open or closed) is → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/AllObjects[`AllObjects`]
(which can be accessed via `→ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/CurrentProject[CurrentProject].allForms`).

Unlike other collections (at least in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model[Excel's Object Model]) The first form has the index `0`, not `1`!

  → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model
