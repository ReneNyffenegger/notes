$ Access Object Model: QueryDef - execute with dbFailOnError

IMHO, the `â†’ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/QueryDef[queryDef].execute` method should always be given the `dbFailOnError` flag.

In the following example, two tables are created that stand in an foreign key relation ship: `tq84_child` references `tq84_parent`. In the example, it is tried to insert a record into `tq84_child`
that does not refer to a corresponding record in `tq84_parent`. If the `execute` statement does not have the `dbFailOnError` flag, no error is raised, thus the user is not informed about the
wrong data.
