$ Access Object Model: QueryDef - Operation must use an updatable query

The following example code creates the run time error 3073 *Operation must be an updatable query* when the → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/QueryDef/execute[`execute`] method
of the → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/QueryDef[queryDef object] is invoked.

*Why* is that? I have no idea.

{ Update

  … so, the problem really seems to be that the parameter names must not be equal to the column name in the assignment part of the update statement …
  
}
