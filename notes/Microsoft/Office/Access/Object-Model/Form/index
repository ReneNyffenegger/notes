$ Access Object Model: Form

A new form is created with → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Application#access-createXXXX[`access.createForm …`].
-
A rudimentary → development/languages/VBA piece of code that is supposed to demonstrate how a form can be created is → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Application/create/Form[here].

Controls can be added to a form with → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Application#access-createControl[`access.createControl`].

{ Opening and closing forms

? A form is opened with → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DoCmd#doCmd-open-close[`doCmd.openForm "frmName" …`] and closed with `→ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DoCmd[`doCmd`].close acForm…`,
code {
doCmd.openForm "frmName", acNormal , , , , acDialog
code }

  { Form view

    An opened form is displayed in one of severelal *form views*. Each of these form views are listed in the → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/access.acformview[`acFormView`] enumeration:
    table { lrl
      `acDesign` ☰ 1 ☰ Design view
      `acFormDS` ☰ 3 ☰ Datasheet view
      `acFormPivotChart` ☰ 5 ☰ PivotChart view
      `acFormPivotTable` ☰ 4 ☰ PivotTable view
      `acLayout` ☰ 6 ☰ Layout view
      `acNormal` ☰ 0 ☰ Form view, this is the default
      `acPreview` ☰ 2 ☰ Print Preview.
    table }

      These `ac…` correspond to the second parameter in `doCmd.openForm…`

  }

}
{ Section

  A form consists of a few sections. In order to address a specific section, the `section(index)` property must be used. `index` is an enum that lists each section:
  table { ll
    `acDetail`     ☰ 0
    `acHeader`     ☰ 1
    `acFooter`     ☰ 2
    `acPageHeader` ☰ 3
    `acPageFooter` ☰ 4
  table }

  For example, the `width` property of a form can be set with `frmObj.width = …`, but the `height` property must be set in the form's *detail* section: `frmObj.section(acDetail).height = …`.

  { Showing/hiding the header and footer section #acc-form-toggle-hdr-ftr

  
    With → development/languages/VBA, the visibility of the header and footer section can be toggled with
code {
→ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/DoCmd#doCmd-runCommand[doCmd.runCommand] acCmdFormHdrFtr
code }

    In the GUI, the corresponding functionality is exectuted by right clicking the *Detail* «bar» above the form and then choosing *Form Header/Footer*:

  }

}
{ Controls on a form

  The controls on a form are accessible via its `controls` property.

? Because this property is the default property of `form`, it can be ommited when referring to a control. Both of the following two statements are equivalent:
code {
forms!frmXYZ.controls!tbEntry
forms!frmXYZ!tbEntry
code }

}
{ TODO

  { Type of a form

    The type of a form with the name `FooBarBaz` is `Form_FooBarBaz`:
code {
debug.print(forms(0).name)
FooBarBaz
debug.Print(→ development/languages/VBA/functions/typeName[typename](forms(0)))
Form_FooBarBaz
code }

  }
 
}

sa:
  → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/AllObjects[`AllObjects`] is the collection that contains all forms, → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Forms[`Forms`] is the collection that
  only contains *open* forms.
