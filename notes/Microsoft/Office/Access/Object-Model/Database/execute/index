$ Access Object Model: Database.execute

`Database.execute` allows to execute an arbitrary → development/databases/Access/SQL[SQL statement] that does not return records, i.e. DML and DDL statements, but not
→ development/databases/Access/SQL/select[select] statements
-
Microsoft seems to refer to statements that don't return a result set as → development/databases/Access/SQL#access-action-queries[action queries].

In order to execute an SQL statement that returns a → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Recordset[Recordset],
→ Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Database/openRecordset[`database.openRecordset`] or `connection.openRecordset` needs to be used.

  It probably makes sense to add the optional `dbFailOnError` flag in the second parameter:
code {
application.currentDb().execute sqlStmt, dbFailOnError
code }

sa:
  The → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/Database[`Database`] object.

  The → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/QueryDef/execute[`execute`] method of the → Microsoft/Office/Access/Object-Model/QueryDef[`queryDef`] object.
