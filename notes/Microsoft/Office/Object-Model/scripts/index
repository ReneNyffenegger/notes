{ diff-object-properties.bas #vba-diff-object-properties

 `diff-object-properties.bas` allows to find differences (changes) of an → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/object[object's] properties.

  The script is used in two steps. In the first step (`gatherProperties`), the object's property names and their values are stored in a
→ development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Scripting-Runtime/dictionary[dictionary].
  -
  The object is then changed.
  -
  The second step (`diffProperties()`) then compares the current values of the object's properties with those stored in the dictionary. If they differ, the name and the old and new
  value of the property are printed.
