$ Office: configure auto corrections with PowerShell

The following → Windows/PowerShell[PowerShell] script first removes all autocorrections (that are stored
in → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Office/MSOxxxx_acl[autocorrect list (.acl) files] under
→ Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Office[%AppData%\Microsoft\Office]) and then adds those that are not
commented.

If the current → Microsoft/Office[Office] installation supports multiple language, it seems that prior to running the script, the default language must be set to the language of
which the autocorrections need to be changed (For example by changing the value of `InstallLanguage` under the → Windows/registry[registry] key
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Common/LanguageResources[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\_version_\Common\LanguageResources`].
