$ PowerPoint: basics of event handling with VBA

In order to handle PowerPoint events in VBA, a → development/languages/VBA/language/classes[class] (stored in a
→ development/languages/VBA/language/module/class[class module]) and a → development/languages/VBA/language/module[regular VBA module] are needed.

{ evt.cls

  The class module is needed to declare a class that receives the events, here: `evtReceiver` and its method(s) which will be called when the associated event is raised.

  Note: the name of the class module (here: `evt`) is needed in the regular module, see below.

}
{ Module

  The regular module is needed to declare a variable whose type corresponds to the name of the class module (here `evt`), to create an instance of that object with
  → development/languages/VBA/language/operators/new[`new`] and to assign `application` to the variable's `evtReceiver` member.
