$ MS Office: 32 bit vs 64 bit

An ~advantage~ of 64-bit Office is that larger file sizes are supported.
-
Also, → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbooks] of the 32-bit version of Excel 2010 can have «only» up to 255 → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[sheets].

A 32-bit → Microsoft/Office/Excel installation can address only up to 2 GB memory. This might impact the *SSAS Vertipaq Engine*, which is used by → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Power-Pivot, negatively.

Some ~disadvantages~ of 64-bit Office include:
  • Some features that are present in 32-bit Office are missing in 64-bit Office (notably: The legacy equation editor of → Microsoft/Office/Word and Word Add-in Libraries (WLLs)).
  • Rendering graphics might be subject to performance degradation because 64-bit does not support MMX.
  • When porting or migrating → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] from → development/languages/VBA/language/32-vs-64-bit[32-bit to 64-bit], → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/declare[`declare`] statements need to be updated (See → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/declare#vba-declare-ptrSafe[`ptrSafe`])
  • ActiveX and → Windows/development/COM[COM] add-ins that were written for 32-bit environments won't run in 64-bit Office. Similarly, In-place OLE activation might not work.
  • → development/databases/Access files with the extensions `.mde`, `ade` and `.accde` that have had their source code removed cannot be run on 64-bit Office
  • MAPI applications need to be rebuilt.

Because the disadvantages in most cases outweigh the advantages, Microsoft recommends for most users to use 32-bit Office.

A 64-bit version of → Microsoft/Office runs on a 64-bit version of → Windows only.

Microsoft does not support the installation of both a 64-bit and 32-bit version of Office on the same machine. Thus, in order to change the Office bitness, the «old» version needs to be uninstalled.

Some applications prevent the installation of a 64-bit Office. These applications include
  • Microsoft Office Excel Viewer
  • → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider/Microsoft-Access-database-engine[Access database engine] of Access 2013
  • Compatibility Pack for the 2007 Office system

  The bitness of an Office installation is also revealed under → Microsoft/Office/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/File/Account[File -> Account], then clicking on *About …*.

  In → Microsoft/Office/Excel, the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[Worksheet function] `info("osVersion")` evaluates to a string like `Windows (32-bit) NT 10.00` which allows to infer the bitness of the Office installation.
