$ Excel: reduce size

An → development/filename-extensions#xlsx[`.xlsx`] or
An → development/filename-extensions#xlsm[`.xlsm`] is a → development/archive-files/zip. Thus, in order to determine what occupies the most size in an Excel file,
it might be copied and renamed with the → development/filename-extensions[extension] `.zip`. The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[sheet] that uses the most space
is then easiliy found.
