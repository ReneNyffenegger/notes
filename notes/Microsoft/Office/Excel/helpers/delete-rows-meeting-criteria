$ Excel: delete rows meeting an arbitrary criteria

The following function takes two arguments: a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] and a formula.
-
The formula is expected to contain a `@`.
-
The function then iterates over each *cell* in the range and applies the function to the cell. During the iteration, it replaces the `@` with the actual value of the cell.
-
Rows in which the formula is true, will be deleted.

When using the function, → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/inputBox[`application.inputBox()`] might be used to select a
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range].

The following example deletes rows in which the selected cells have the letter `a` in the second place.
code {
call deleteRowsWithCriteria(application.inputBox("", type := 8), "mid(@, 2, 1) = ""a""")
code }

This call deletes rows where values of the cells are larger than 2.
code {
call deleteRowsWithCriteria(application.inputBox("", type := 8), "@>2")
code }
