$ PowerShell: Convert Excel worksheets of workbooks in a directory to CSV files

The following → Windows/PowerShell/script[PowerShell script] (or → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[function])
originated in the StackOverflow question → https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68944046[How can I extract a particular worksheet in an xlsx spreadsheet as a text file?].

It iterates over all `*.xls*` → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbooks] in a given directory
(parameter `$dir`), opens each of them, then tries to find a
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet with a given name (parameter `$sheetName`) and then calls the
workbook's method `saveAs()` with the value 6 (which is the number for the file format `xlCSV`).

The function sets the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/display/alerts[`displayAlerts`] property to `$false` to prevent Excel from showing the confirmation
message box when trying to export a file.
