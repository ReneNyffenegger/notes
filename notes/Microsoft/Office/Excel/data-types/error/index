}

{ Error values

  Some (all?) excel error values are:
  table { lll
    `#DIV/0` ☰ Division by zero. ☰
    → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/error/na[`#N/A`]   ☰ A formula cannot find what it is supposed to look for. ☰ This value is also returned by the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[worksheet function] `=na()`.
    `#NAME`  ☰ Unrecognized text ☰
    `#NULL` ☰ ☰
    `#NUM!` ☰ ☰
    `#REF!!` ☰ ☰
    `#VALUE!` ☰ ☰
    `#SPILL!` ☰ ☰
  table }

  { Numbers stored as text #xls-err-num-txt

    A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number[number] stored as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text[text] is also considered an error (it displays the green triangle) along with the
  number. The triangle can be removed (suppressed) in → development/languages/VBA or the Immediate window with variants of:
code {
cells(r, c).→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Errors[errors](xlNumberAsText).ignore = true
code }
  or:
code {
→ development/languages/VBA/language/statements/for#vba-for-each[for each] c in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/selection: c.→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Errors[errors](xlNumberAsText).ignore = true: next c
code }
