$ Excel: the error data type

A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[function] or formula that → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] fails to evaluate yields an *error value*.

{ Green triangle

  A cell that contains an error is recognized by a *green triangle* in its upper left corner as shown in the the cell located at `C3` in the
  following image:

}

{ Error values

  Some (all?) excel error values are:
    • `#DIV/0`: Division by zero.
    • `#N/A`: A formula cannot find what it is supposed to look for.
    • `#NAME`: Unrecognized text
    • `#NULL`
    • `#NUM!`
    • `#REF!!`
    • `#VALUE!`


  Apparently, a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number[number] stored as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text[text] is also considered an error (it displays the green triangle) along with the
  number.
