$ Excel: the error data type

A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[function] or formula that → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] fails to evaluate yields an *error value*.

{ Green triangle #excel-green-triangle

  A cell that contains an error is recognized by a *green triangle* in its upper left corner as shown in the the cell located at `C3` in the
  following image:

}

{ Error values

  Some (all?) excel error values are:
  table { ll
    `#DIV/0` ☰ Division by zero.
    `#N/A`   ☰ A formula cannot find what it is supposed to look for.
    `#NAME`  ☰ Unrecognized text
    `#NULL` ☰
    `#NUM!` ☰
    `#REF!!` ☰
    `#VALUE!` ☰
    `#SPILL!` ☰
  table }


  A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number[number] stored as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text[text] is also considered an error (it displays the green triangle) along with the
  number. The triangle can be removed (suppressed) with → development/languages/VBA like so:
code {
cells(r, c).errors(xlNumberAsText).ignore = true
code }
