$ Excel: Using minus minus to convert a boolean value to 0 or 1

When involved in a mathematical expression, `TRUE` is considered to be `1` and `FALSE` to be `0`.

Thus, → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/boolean[boolean] values can be turned into → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number[numerical] representation by using minus (`-`) twice on the
boolean value.

In the following example, the → development/languages/VBA[VBA] code inserts a few boolean values into the first column and then inserts a formula with two minus signs to represent the boolean value
as `0` or `1`:
gh|about-Excel|/data-types/boolean/dash-dash.bas||

If run, the program produces:
gh|about-Excel|/data-types/boolean/img/dash-dash.png||

sa:

  Using `--` comes in handy for example in the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/sumproduct[`sumproduct`] function.
