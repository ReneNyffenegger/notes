$ Excel: serial number

Excel stores a date and/or time as a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number[(64-bit floating point) number] which stores the (fractional) number of days between December 31st 1899 and the date stored.
-
This number is referred to as *serial number*.

Because Excel has a bug and incorrectly treats the year 1900 as a leap year, it also counts 29th of February 1900 (which is an inexisting date).
-
Thus, the serial numbers become:
table { lr
 ~Date~ ☰ ~Ser. nr.~
  1899-12-31 ☰  0
  1900-01-01 ☰  1
  1900-01-02 ☰  2
  … ☰ …
  1900-01-31 ☰ 31
  1900-02-01 ☰ 32
  … ☰ …
  1900-02-28 ☰ 59
 *1900-02-29* ☰*60*
  1900-03-01 ☰ 61
  1900-03-02 ☰ 62
  … ☰ …
  2009-07-05 ☰ 39999
  2009-07-06 ☰ 40000
  2009-07-07 ☰ 40001
  … ☰ …
  2021-09-05 ☰ 44444
  … ☰ …

table }

{ Fractional part of serial number

  The serial number's fractional part specifies the portition of a day for which time information is stored.

  So *2009-06-07, 6:00 AM* is stored as the serial number 40000.25

}
{ Relation to OLE Automation date representations

  A *OLE Automation date* is a double-precision floating-point number that represents a date as the number of days before or after the base date, midnight, 30 December 1899 and thus related
  to Excel's serial number: for values greater than or equal to 61, an OLE Automation date value corresponds to the same date as the same serial number in Excel.

  The → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/DateTime[.NET type `System.DateTime`] provides the methods
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/DateTime/_FileTime/_OLE-Automation[`FromOADate` and `ToOADate`] to convert between an OLE Automation date and a `System.DateTime` value,
  as is shown in the following simple → Windows/PowerShell snippet:
code {
PS C:\> [System.DateTime]::FromOADate(60)

Wednesday, February 28, 1900 12:00:00 AM

PS C:\> [System.DateTime]::FromOADate(61)

Thursday, March 1, 1900 12:00:00 AM

PS C:\> [System.DateTime]::FromOADate(44444)

Sunday, September 5, 2021 12:00:00 AM
code }


}
