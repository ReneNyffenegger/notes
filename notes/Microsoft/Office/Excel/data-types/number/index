$ Excel: the number data type
@ number

The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[Excel data type] *number* is used to store numbers (which seems obviously) and also dates (see → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number/serial[serial numbers]).

The representation of a number is controlled by a Range's → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range#excel-range-numberFormat[`numberFormat`] property or the *Number* tab in the *Format Cells* dialog box
(to be opened with right-click on a cell/range or via *Ribbon-Home* -> *Number*)

{ TODO

  Apparently, → Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] considers a number stored as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text[text] to be an
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/error[error].

}

sa:

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/type[worksheet function `type(value)`] returns 1 for number values.

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[Excel data types]
