`=address(→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/row-column[row](), → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/row-column[column]())` is particularly useful to create a *reference* to the
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell that contains the function.

{ Comparing with INDIRECT()

  The worksheet function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/indirect[`indirect()`] creates a reference that can be used as input for `address()`.

  The following formula evaluates to `D1`:
code {
=address(indirect("d1"); true; 4)
code }

}
