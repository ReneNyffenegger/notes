$ Excel conversion functions

Excel has some conversion functions whose name generally is `x2y`, for example `dec2bin` which converts a decimal number to its binary representation.

{ Demonstration of dec2bin

  The following example tries to demonstrate `dec2bin`.

  Unfortunately, as the second row shows, `dec2bin` cannot convert a number greater then 511, it causes a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell/errors[`#NUM!` cell error].
  -
  Therefore, the third row concatentes two resultes of `dec2bin` with the concatenation operator `&`.
