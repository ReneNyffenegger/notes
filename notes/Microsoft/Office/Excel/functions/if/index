$ Excel function: if

`=if(condition, value-true, value-false)` behaves like a *ternary operator*: it checks if the first argument is true and shows either the second or third argument.

{ Eliminate outliers

  With `if`, it's possible to eliminate outliers. This is demonstrated in the following example.
  -
 `testData()` fills a few values into the first column and adds an average below the values.
  -
 `removeOutliers()` uses `if(â€¦)` to check if the value in the cell to the left is greater than 100 in which case it is eliminated. It also adds an average for the values.
