$ Excel function: IF

`=if(condition, value-true, value-false)` behaves like a *ternary operator*: it checks if the first argument is true and evaluates to either the second (if true) or third argument (if false).

{ Notify user if two cells have different values

  A common use case for `if` is to compare the data that is stored in two cells. The following → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas evaluates to `Values are different` if the values in the
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell `F1` is different from the value in cell F2. If they're equal, the formula evaluates to an empty → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text[string].
code {
=IF(F1<>F2; "Values are different"; "")
code }

}
{ Eliminate outliers

  With `if`, it's possible to eliminate outliers. This is demonstrated in the following example.
  -
 `testData()` fills a few values into the first column and adds an average below the values.
  -
 `removeOutliers()` uses `if(…)` to check if the value in the cell to the left is greater than 100 in which case it is eliminated. It also adds an average for the values.
