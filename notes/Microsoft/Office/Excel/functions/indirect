$ Excel function: INDIRECT
@ indirect

`indirect` returns the *reference* that a given address refers to.

The following → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas returns the reference to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell D1. Because a reference is displayed as the
value of the cell that the reference refers, this → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas just displays the value of the cell `D1`:
code {
=indirect("d1")
code }

Same thing, but use R1C1 → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-cell-address[reference style]:
code {
=indirect("r1c4", false)
code }

Because the returned value is a reference, the following formula evaluates to `true`:
code {
=→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/isref(indirect("f3"))
code }

The «opposite» function of `indirect` is → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/address[`address`]: it turns a reference into a text that identifies the referenced cell.
-
The following formula evaluates to `D1`:
code {
=address(indirect("d1"); true; 4)
code }

A convoluted way to display the value of the cell that is above the cell containing a formula:
code {
=indirect(→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/address( row()-1, column() ))
code }

{ Misc

 `indirect` is a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/_volatile.

}

sa:

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/offset[`offset()`] is another function that returns a reference.
