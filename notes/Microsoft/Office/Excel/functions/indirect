$ Excel function: indirect


Return reference to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell D1:
code {
=indirect("d1")
code }

Same thing, but use R1C1 stype:
code {
=indirect("r1c4"; false)
code }

Because the returned value is a reference, the following formula evaluates to `true`:
code {
=→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/type(indirect("f3"))
code }

The function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/address[`address`] turns a reference into a text that identifies the referenced cell.
-
The following formula evaluates to `D1`:
code {
=address(indirect("d1"); true; 4)
code }

{ Misc

 `indirect` is a *volatile function*.

}

sa:

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/offset[`offset()`] is another function that returns a reference.

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[Excel functions]
