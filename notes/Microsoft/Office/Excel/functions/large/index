$ Excel function: large

{ Sort numbers

  The following → development/languages/VBA[VBA] example fills 10 random numbers (→ development/languages/VBA/functions/rnd[`rnd()`]) into the first column and uses the
 `large(range, n)` function to sort these random numbers in the second column:
  gh|about-Excel|/functions/large/sort-numbers.bas||

  If run, the function produces:
  gh|about-Excel|/functions/large/img/sort-numbers.png||

  The same can also be achieved with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/array[array formulas] by
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/array/row/large[combining `large` and `row`].
