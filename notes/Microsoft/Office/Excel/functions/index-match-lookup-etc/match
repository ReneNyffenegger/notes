$ Excel function: match

code {
=match(value, array)
=match(value, array, matchType)
code }

`match` returns the (1-based) position of the element in `array` that is equal to or comes closest to the value of `value`.

If `matchType` is `0`, the value in `array` must be equal to the `value` searched for and the order of the elements in `array` is not important.

If `matchtype` is `1`, the array must be sorted in ascending order and `match(…)` returns the last position of the element whose value is equal or smaller than the `value` searched for.
-
If `matchtype` is `-1`, the opposite is true: the `array` must be sorted in descending order and `match(…)` returns the position of the last element in `array` whose value is larger or equal to
the `value` searched for.

The default for `matchtype` is `1`.

{ Hardcoded value for 2nd parameter

  It's possible to use hardcoded values in the 2nd parameter using curly braces.

  If the value of cell `d3` is `mi`, the following example evaluates to 3.
code {
=match(d3; {"mo","di","mi", "do", "fr", "sa", "so"}; 0)
code }

}

{ Demonstration

  The following example tries to demonstrate the different possible combinations.

  The values in the first column are ordered and a named → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range is assigned to it: `someNumbers`. Such a named range can be used to refer to `array` in
 `match(…, arrayName, …).

  The values in the second column are unordered and the name of its range is `spellings`.

  The fourth and seventh column show a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[function] that uses `match()` and the
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cells] right to it what the formula
  evaluates to.

  It can be seen that `array` needs to be ordered when using `matchtype` different from 0. For example, `match("thirty", spellings, 1)` returns `2`.
