$ Excel function: let

The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[Excel function] `let` allows to declare variables and then use their values within the function.

Assign 17 to `x`, 13 to `y`, then calculate `x*y`:
code {
=let( x; 17 ;  y; 13 ;   x*y )
code }


It's possible to assign the returned value of an Excel function to a variable.
-
Here, the string `"Hello world"` is assigned to `txt`, then the length of that string is evaluated with the function `len()` and assigned to
the variable `txtLen`, finally, a string which is assembled of text constants and the values of the variables is returned.
code {
=let( txt; "Hello world" ;  txtLen; len(txt) ; "The length of '" & txt & "' is " & txtLen )
code }
