$ Excel function: hyperlink

code {
=hyperlink(target)
=hyperlink(target; friendlyName)
code }

{ Jumping to a certain address

  In order to jump to address `N18` on the *same* → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet, the target is simply `#N18`:
code {
=hyperlink("#N18"; "Go to N18)
code }

  The address can also be specifed in `RxCy` notation:
code {
=hyperlink("#r18c9"; "Jump to to row 18, column 9")
code }

  It's possible to specify a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range#excel-range-name[named range] as destination:
code {
=hyperlink("#target"; "Go to target")
code }

  In order to have a hyperlink to another sheet, the sheet name must be separated from the target by an exclamation mark. (See also → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range#excel-range-refer-to[referring to ranges in Excel]):
code {
=hyperlink("#SheetName!addr"; "...")
code }

  Finally, a target in another → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook] can be linked to like so (sheet is 
code {
=hyperlink("[C:\users\rene\Documents\workbook.xlsx]sheet!addr"; "...")
code }

}
{ Calling a VBA function with a hyperlink

  It is possible to call a → development/languages/VBA/functions[VBA function] with a hyperlink by prepending the name of the `target` with a hash symbol (`#`):
code {
=hyperlink("#hyperlinkClick()"; "go")
code }

The function then needs to be declared in a → development/languages/VBA/language/module[VBA module] like so
code {
function hyperlinkClick() as range

   set hyperlinkClick = → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/index#excel-application-selection[selection]
   msgBox "clicked

end function
code }

  It is also possible to pass parameters (references, scalars…) to to the function

code {
=hyperlink("#funcWithParam(  a1)"                ; "go")
=hyperlink("#funcWithParam(""hard coded value"")"; "go")
code }

}
