$ Excel function: lookup

There's a vector and an array form for → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/lookup[`lookup`]. Microsoft recommends to use `vlookup` or `hlookup` instead of the *array* form of `lookup`.

Vector form:
code {
=lookup( lookupValue, lookupVector [, resultVector] )
code }

Array form:
code {
=lookup( lookupValue, array )
code }

In both forms, the items in `lookupVector` or `array` must be sorted in ascending order, otherwise `lookup` does not work properly.

`lookup` finds the element in `lookupVector` or `array` that comes right before or is `lookupValue`, that is the largest element that is smaller than or equal to `lookupValue`.

If `lookupValue` is smaller than the smallest value, `lookup` returns → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/error/na[`#N/A`].


{ Simple example

  2019-10-01: It turns out that this example is *not* a good example and needs to be corrected. The thing is that `lookup`
  relies on an *ordered* → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] to perform its lookup. September returns the «correct» value in the following example by sheer chance.
