$ Excel function: find

code {
fsubstr; text[; start_pos])
code }

`find` returns the position of the character in `text` at which `substr` is (case-sensitively) found (after `start_pos`). Evaluates to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell/errors[`#VALUE`] if not found.

The following example combines `find` with `left`, `right` and `len` to split a text on a given separator (which is the vertical bar in the example):
