$ Excel: Volatile functions
@ volatile function

The *volatility* of a function (either → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[worksheet functions] or → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[user defined VBA functions]) affect when
the the function is called for → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[formula recalculation purposes].

A *volatile function* is always called when
  • The value of *any* cell changes on the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet]
  • One of the `F9` → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[recalculation] shortcut keys is pressed.

In contrast, the *non-volatile function* are only called by pressing
  • `ctrl+alt+F9`
  • `ctrl+alt+shift+F9`


Volatile → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[worksheet functions] include
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/cell[`cell`]
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/info[`info`] (for some arguments)
  • `now`, `today`
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/offset[`offset`]
  • `randBetween`
  • `sumIf`

A → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[user defined VBA function] can be marked (in Excel, that is) to be volatile with
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/volatile[`application.volatile`].
