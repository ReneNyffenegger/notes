$ Excel function: sumproduct

`=sumproduct( array-1, array-2, … )` multiplies each array's nth element and sums up their products.

{ Simple example

  The following → development/languages/VBA[VBA] code inserts a few values into the first and second column and then inserts the `sumproduct` formula into
  the lower right adjacent cell to calculate the sum of the numbers in the same row:

  The result is 62 = 5*3 + 7*2 + 4*6 + 1*9:

}
{ Finding equal values

  The following example tries to demonstrate how `sumproduct` can be used to sum the values in the third
  coulumn where the values in the first and second column are equal.

  In the inserted formula, the first array is constructed by comparing the values of the first and second column which returns
  a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/boolean[boolean] value. The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/boolean/minus-minus[`--` (minus minus)] in the
  formula is then used to convert this boolean value into `0` or `1`.

  The formula returns 24 which is the sum of 2 (3rd row) and 22 (7th row):
