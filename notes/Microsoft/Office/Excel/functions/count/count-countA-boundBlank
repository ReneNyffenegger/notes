$ Excel functions: count, countA, countBlank

`count` only counts → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number[numbers].

`countA` counts everything that is non empty, even → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/error[error values].

`countBlank` seems to count the opposite set of what `countA` counts.

The following simple → development/languages/VBA program creates some test data to play with these functions:
gh|about-Excel|/functions/count/count-countA-countBlank.bas||

Whe executed, the program produces:
gh|about-Excel|/functions/count/img/count-countA-countBlank.png||

In the fifth row, `countA()` evaluates to `2` beacuse `" "` and `chr(9)` (the tabulator) are counted as non-empty.

{ Use countA() to count the number of elements in a list

 `countA()` can be applied on a list in which case it counts the number of elements in this list:
  -
 `=countA("foo"; 42; "baz"; 99; "bar")` evaluates to `5`

}
