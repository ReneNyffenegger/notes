$ Excel function: filter

code {
=filter(rng; cond [; if_empty])
code }

`filter` copies («spills») the portion of the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] `rng` for which the condition `cond` matches to the cell that contains the formula.

{ Visual Basic for Applications example

  The following → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)] example tries to demonstrate how `filter()` might be used:

  First, the → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[function] `testdata` fills the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] `B2:D9` with some test data. The first column (`B`) is the value that will be used for
  filtering the rest of the data.

  Then, the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell `F1` set to the value we want to filter on (`bar`).

  Finally, the cell `F2` is given the `filter()` formula to display the values of `C2:D9` for which the value in the column `B` matches that of `F1`:
