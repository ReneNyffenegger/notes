$ Excel worksheet functions

Most of the Excel worksheet functions are exposed to → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] through the
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/WorksheetFunction[WorksheetFunction] object.

Although white spaces can usually bu used liberally when entering → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formulas], the parentheses after the function name cannot be separated by a space.

Depending on a setting, arguments in a worksheet function must be separated with either → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/_semicolon-or-comma[semicolons or formulas].

With the function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/let[`let`], it's possible to declare local variables in a function and use them.
