$ Excel worksheet functions

Most of the Excel worksheet functions are exposed to → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] through the
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/WorksheetFunction[WorksheetFunction] object.

TODO:
  • `countA(rng)` returns the number of cells in `rng` that are not empty. (Compare with `isBlank()`)
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/countif[`countif`]
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/large[`large`] to find the nth largest element in a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] or → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/array[array]
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/sumproduct[`=sumproduct( array-1, array-2, … )`] multiplies each array's nth element and sums up their products.


{ address #excel-func-address

 `address` returns a textual representation of an → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-cell-address[address] (such as `$E$10` or `R[10]C[5]`).

}
{ cell #excel-func-cell-filename

 `cell(filename); a1` can be used to find the filename of an Excel → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook].

  gh|about-Excel|/functions/cell/filename.bas||

  Getting the path, including trailing backslash, to a workbook
code {
=left( cell("filename";a1) ; find("[" ; cell("filename";a1) )  -1)
code }

  Compare with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet#excel-workbook-fullName[worksheet.fullName].

}
{ find

 `find` returns the position of a character within a text.

  The following example combines `find` with `left`, `right` and `len` to split a text on a given separator (which is the vertical bar in the example):

}
{ if

  `=→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/if[if](condition, value-true, value-false)` behaves like a *ternary operator*: it checks if the first argument (`condition`) is true and shows either the second or third argument.

}
{ index

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/index_[`index`] returns the nth element in an array (which can be specified as a (vertical?) → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range]).

}
{ lookup

  There's a vector and an array form for → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/lookup[`lookup`]. Microsoft recommends to use `vlookup` or `hlookup` instead of the *array* form of `lookup`.

}
{ match

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/match[`match`] returns the index of a given item in an array.


}
{ offset

 → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/offset[`offset()`] returns a reference to a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] that is offset from a specific address
   by a given amount of rows and columns.

}
{ row / column #excel-func-row-column

  `row` and `column` return the row and column number of the current cell or referenced → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-cell-address[address]

  gh|about-Excel|/functions/row-column.bas||

}
{ rows / columns

  See → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/rows-columns[here].

}
{ sumifs

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/sumifs[`sumifs`] adds numbers in a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] that meet certain conditions. 

}
{ type

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/type[`type`] returns a number that indicates the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[data type] (of a cell?).
