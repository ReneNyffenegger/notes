$ Excel worksheet functions

Most of the Excel worksheet functions are exposed to → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] through the
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/WorksheetFunction[WorksheetFunction] object.

Although white spaces can usually bu used liberally when entering → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formulas], the parentheses after the function name cannot be separated by a space.


{ if

  `=→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/if[if](condition, value-true, value-false)` behaves like a *ternary operator*: it checks if the first argument (`condition`) is true and shows either the second or third argument.
