$ Querying data from Excel with SQL using OLE DB

The following → development/languages/VBA code demonstrates how SQL and OLE DB can be used to query data in → Microsoft/Office/Excel:
code {
→ development/languages/VBA/language/statements/option/explicit
 
sub main() ' {
 
  dim con as → development/databases/ADO/objects/connection[adodb.connection]
  set con = openExcelConnection
 
  dim rs as → development/databases/ADO/objects/recordSet[adodb.recordSet]
  set rs = con.→ development/databases/ADO/objects/connection/execute[execute]("select * from rng_2") ' rng_2 is the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range#excel-range-name[name] of a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range]. Use [sheetName$] (with $) to select from an entire sheet.
 
  sheets("sheet3").cells(1,1).→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/copyFromRecordset rs
 
end sub ' }
 
function openExcelConnection() as adodb.connection ' {
 
   dim provider as string
 ' provider="Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0"
   provider="Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.15.0"
 
   set openExcelConnection = new adodb.connection
   openExcelConnection.open                                   _
     "Provider="              &  provider                   & _
    ";Data Source="           &  activeWorkbook.fullName    & _
    ";Extended Properties=""" & "Excel 12.0;HDR=yes"        & """"
 
end function ' }
code }

The workbook, in which this code is executed, needs a → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/Reference to ADODB which can be added in the
→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window with
code {
thisWorkbook.VBProject.references.addFromGuid "{B691E011-1797-432E-907A-4D8C69339129}", 6, 1
code }
