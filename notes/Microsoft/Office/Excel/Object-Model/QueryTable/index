$ Office Object Model: Excel - QueryTable

{ connection

  The `.connection` property is a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string that contains the information needed to connect to a data source and query data from it.

  This string consists of two parts that are separated by a semicolon.
  -
  The *first part* seems to correspond to the value of the queryTable's `.commandType` value (which is a value of the `xlCmdType` enumeration). Some values for the first part include
    • `URL`
    • `TEXT`
    •  etc.

}
{ TODO

  The `saveAsODC` method allows to create → development/filename-extensions#odc[`.ocd` (Office Data Connection) files].

  Apparently, a queryTable's `.recordSet` property evaluates to a → development/databases/DAO record source (probably when the queryTable gets the data from an
  → development/databases/Access[MS Access dtabase]

  { Relationship with List Objects?

    There is a 1:1 relationship between a `queryTable` and a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/ListObject[`listObject`]: the list object has the property `.queryTable` and the query table has the
    property `.listObject` which, at least in my tests point to one another.

    However, not only list objects are consumers of query tables: for example, both the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[`worksheet`] and
    → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`range`] objects have a `.queryTables` property.

  }

}

sa:

  Using a `queryTable` object together with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/ListObject[list objects] to query data from
    • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/ListObject/connectionString/Excel[Excel]
    • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/ListObject/connectionString/CSV[CSV] (Also → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/QueryTable/CSV[here])

  A queryTable can use a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/WorkbookConnection[`workbookConnection`] object which (centrally) stores the information that is needed to access
  (external?) → development/Data.

 → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model
