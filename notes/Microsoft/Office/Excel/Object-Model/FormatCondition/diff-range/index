$ Highlighting differences in two ranges in Excel

This is an example that demonstrates how to highlight data differences in two → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[ranges].

A «record» is identified by an «ID»: columns `C` and `K`. The individual values of a range on the left side
is compared to the values on the right side (for example row 5 (`9-xy-8`) on the left side with row 9 on the right side.

Ids which are only found on one side are marked red:

{ VBA source code

  This is the → development/languages/VBA code to highlight the differences.
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/FormatCondition/diff-ranges/diff-ranges.vb||

}
{ Test data

  Here is a piece of code that creates the test data for the functionality:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/FormatCondition/diff-ranges/test.vb||

}
{ Updates

  2022-03-22: The function `diff_ranges` now sets `external` to `true` in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/address[`range.address`] so as to allow to compare
  data from ranges in two different → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheets].

}

sa:

  Excel's → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/FormatCondition[`FormatCondition` object]
