$ Reading a CSV file into an Excel table (listObject) with Visual Basic for Application

This example tries to demonstrate how a → development/Data/exchange/formats/CSV[CSV file] can be imported into an → Microsoft/Office/Excel/table[Excel table] with
→ development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Application].

In order to access the data in the CSV file, the → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider[OLE DB provider] → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Microsoft_ACE_OLEDB_12_0[Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0] is used.

{ tab.csv

  This is the CSV file we're going to import.

}
{ schema.ini

  The → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider/Microsoft-Access-database-engine/engines/Text/schema_ini[schema.ini] file defines some characteristics of the CSV file, such as column names, column data types and date/time format.
  -
  Because `tab.csv` is encoded in → development/Unicode/UTF-8, the → development/databases/OLE-DB/provider/Microsoft-Access-database-engine/engines/Text/schema_ini[schema.ini] file contains
  the `characterSet = 65001`. This ensures that the fourth data line in the CSV file is imported correctly.

}
{ Created list object

  The following image shows the created list object. As can be seen, the dates are imported with the correct numbers (days since 1899-12-31), but not formatted correctly.

  It also shows that the é of *René* is correct (as per specification of `characterSet` in the *schema.ini* file).
