$ Catching Excel Events with VBA

{ Changes on a worksheet

  The following sub is called when the user changes a value on a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet]. If the changed value is in the second column, the code changes
  the color of the cell left to it to a specific color.

  The code for the sub must be placed into the Visual Basic component belonging to the worksheet rather than into a specific code module.

}
{ Change of a selection #excel-selectionChange

  The event handler `worksheet_selectionChange(→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions/byVal-byRef[byVal] rng as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range])` is invoked when the
  selected set of cells changes on a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet].

  Such a change takes place if a user
    • mouse clicks on a new cells
    • uses the arrow or other naviagation keys to move to different cells
    • … (?)

  A use case for such an event handler might be to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Comment#excel-comment-show-hide[show/hide comments] with the `selectionChange` event handler.

  { Detecting mouse clicks

     Unfortunately, it seems impossible to detect if the user clicked a cell with the mouse with Excel features only.

     However, it *might* be possible with the → Windows/development/WinAPI function `GetAsyncKeyState`, see → https://stackoverflow.com/a/31944759/180275[this Stackoverflow answer]

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Hyperlink/followHyperlink[This example] demonstrates how the
  → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/CodeModule[`codeMOdule`] object is used to create a dynamic
  event khandler for a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Hyperlink[`hyperlink`] on a
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[`worksheet`].
