$ Catching Excel Events with VBA

{ Changes on a worksheet

  The following sub is called when the user changes a value on a worksheet. If the changed value is in the second column, the code changes
  the color of the cell left to it to a specific color.

  The code for the sub must be placed into the Visual Basic component belonging to the worksheet rather than into a specific code module.
