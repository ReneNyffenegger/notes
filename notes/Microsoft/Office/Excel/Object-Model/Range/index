$ Office Object Model: Excel - Range
@ Range

A range consists of a number of → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cells] that need not necessarily be adjacent.

Core properties of ranges include
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/value[`value`]
  • `formula`
  • `format`

A `Range` object can be obtained by using one of the two properties `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-cells[application.cells]` or `application.range`.

The method → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/inputBox[`application.inputBox`] allows a user to select a range with the mouse and pass the selected range to a
→ development/languages/VBA program.

Each of the four edges (borders) of a range is represented by a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Border object.
-
A range's `borderAround` method draws a border around its area.

An individual → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cell] is referred to by a range.

{ default member #excel-range-default-member

  Without arguments, the range's default member returns the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/value[`value`] property.

  With arguments, the default member returns the result of → #excel-range-item[`item(…)`], called with the same arguments.

  Thus,
    • `rngDest = rngSrc` is equivalent to `rngDest.value = rngSrc.value`,
    • `rng(x)` is equivalent to `rng.item(x)` and
    • `rng(x,y)` is equivalent to `rng.item(x,y)`.

}
{ Item(…) #excel-range-item

  The `item` property is called by the → #excel-range-default-member[default member] if invoked with arguments.

  `Item()` method comes in two forms:
    • `item(arg)`
    • `item(arg_1, arg_2)`

   { Referring to other workbooks and/or worksheets #excel-range-refer-to

     Get the value in the 4th row, 2nd column of the *current* worksheet:
code {
val = range("b4")
code }

    In order to refer to the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] named `worksheetName`, the name is separated from the address with an exclamation mark (`!`):
code {
val = range("worksheetName!b3")
code }

    The name of a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook] is put into square brackets:
code {
val = range("[workbookName.xlsx]worksheetName!a3")
code }

   In order to refer to a workbook with full path, single quotes are needed:
code {
val = range("'P:\ath\to\other\[workbookName.xlsx]worksheetName'!a3")
code }

 ? Such single quotes are also advisable when referring to a workbook or worksheet with special characters:
code {
='[foo-bar.xlsm]config'!$D$18
code }

   }

}
{ Selecting multiple cells

  The following example creates a `Range` object and uses it to modify some properties in all → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cells] from *B3* to *E9* (such as assigning a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formula] or modifying
  the font):

}
{ Setting values within the range #excel-range-set-values

  A range's `value` property can be assigned a (one dimension) value in which case all cells of that range will have that value.

  If an → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays is assigned, the values of the array are used to fill the columns of the range.

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/value.bas||

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/img/value.png||


  Compare with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/value#excel-write-2D-array[writing a 2D array to a worksheet] and
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/WorksheetFunction/transpose#excel-transpose-array[Using `WorksheetFunction.transpose` to write an array vertically to a worksheet].

  See also → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/VBA-arrays

}
{ Iterating over the cells in a range #excel-range-for-each

  The → development/languages/VBA/language/statements/for/index#vba-for-each[for each] statement allows to iterate over the cells in a range:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/for-each.bas||

}
{ Modifying a cell's (interior) color

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/interior.bas||

  In order to remove the filling color, the interior's `.pattern` property must be set to `xlNone`:
code {
cells(x, y).interior.pattern = xlNone
code }

}
{ Naming a range #excel-range-name

  A range can be given a hopefully meaningful name by assigning a (→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string]-) value to its `.name` property.
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/name.bas||

  Such a named range is stored in a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Name[`name`] object which is stored in a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook's] `names` collection.
  Thus, a named range can alternatively also be created with `names.add …`.

  Names that are defined with `range(…).name = "…"` are *global* to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook]. It is possible, however, to define names for ranges that are *local* to
  a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet with
code {
activeWorksheet.names.add name := "invoiceNumber", refersToR1C1 := "Sheet1!R5C5"
code }

  The method → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/createNames[`range.createNames`] automatically creates named ranges from a region's header and row names.

  With → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/language[Power Query M formula], it is possible to access the values in a named range with → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/standard-library/Excel/CurrentWorkbook[`Excel.CurrentWorkbook`].

  In the GUI, a range or cell can be named using the *name box*.

  With → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/language[Formula-M], the data of a (named) range can be queried with the
  → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/standard-library/Excel/CurrentWorkbook/get-data-of-range[`Excel.CurrentWorkbook()` function].

}
{ numberFormat #excel-range-numberFormat

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/numberFormat[`numberFormat`] specifies how the → development/Data of a range's underlying → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cells'] data is formatted.

  Formatting, such as what applied with `.numberFormat`, can be removed with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/clearFormats[`rng.clearFormats`].
  
}
{ Selecting multiple colunms

  `Range(…)` can be passed two `columns(n)` in which case it selects the range between those two columns.

  In the following example, the columns 4 through 9 are selected:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/select-multiple-columns.bas||

}
{ autofit #excel-range-autofit

  The `columns` property (defined in `application`) returns a range object on which `autofit` can be called. This will set the width of the columns such
  that the entire text in the columns is visble.

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/autofit.bas||

  In order to set the width of a column to an arbitrary value, `columnWidth` can be used:
code {
columns(7).columnWidth = 3
code }

  `autofit` might be used in conjunction with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/usedRange#usedRange-autofit[`usedRange`] or `columns` and `entireColumn` 
code {
activeSheet.usedRange.entireColumn.autofit
activeSheet.usedRange.columns.autofit
code }
  
 `autofit` does not change the width of columns that contain no data.

}


{ Create a picture #excel-range-copyPicture

 `range(…).copyPicture` creates a picture of the given range and copies it into the → Windows/clipboard.
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/copyPicture/save-range-as-image[This example then pastes the clipboard into a chart and saves it to a file.

  See also → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/copy[`range.copy`].

}
{ address #excel-range-address

 `address` returns a textual representation of the range.

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/address.bas||

  See also the worksheet function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/address[`address`]

}
{ clearContents #excel-range-clearContents

 `clearContents` deletes the content of a range.
  
  It might be used in conjunction with `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet#excel-worksheet-usedRange[worksheet.usedRange]`.

  In order to not only remove the data but also the underlying formatting of the cells, → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/clearFormats[`clearFormats`] must be used

  See also the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/clear_[range's `clear*` methods].

}
{ noteText() #excel-range-noteText

 `.noteText(txt)` seems to be a shorthand to insert a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Comment[comment].

code {
cells(4,5).noteText("some comment")
code }

}
{ Properties related to the size of a range #excel-range-size-properties

  A range's `.width` and `.height` properties return the width and height of the range in *points*. These properties are read only.

 `.rowHeight` corresponds to the height, measured in *points*, of the first row of the range that it is applied on.
  -
 `.columnWidth` corresponds to the width, measured in *characters* of the default font, of the first(?) column of the range that it is applied on.
 -
 `.rowHeight` and `columnWidth` are read/write properties.
