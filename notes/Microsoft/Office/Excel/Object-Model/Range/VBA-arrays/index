$ Excel Range object and VBA arrays

A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`range`] object is related to a one or → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays#vba-array-multidimensional[two dimensional]
VBA → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays

{ Combining resize and assigning an array

  Combining → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/resize[`resize`] and assigning an → development/languages/VBA/language/arrays[array] to the resized range can be used to dump the content
  of the array onto an excel sheet.

  Similarly, a two dimensional array can be written into cells like so:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/dump-2d-array-into-cells.bas||

}
{ Writing an array horizontally or vertically to a worksheet

 `writeArrayToSheet()` is a simple → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[function] that writes the content of a (one dimensional) array to a
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet, either horizontally or vertically, and returns the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`range`] to which
  the values in the array were written.

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/VBA-arrays/write-array-to-sheet.bas||

  After executing `main`, the arrays were written like so:
