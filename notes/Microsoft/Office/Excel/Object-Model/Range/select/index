$ Excel Object Model: Range.Select

`rng.select` (visually) selects the specified range and moves (if possible) the range's top left → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell to the center of the current window.
(Compare with the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Window/scroll/row-column[`.scrollRow` and `.scrollColumn` properties] of the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Window[`window` object]).

Only ranges of the currently active → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet can be selected.

If `rng.select` is invoked while → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-screenUpdating[`application.screenUpdating`] is set to
→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[`false`], Excel will select the cell, but not move to it, even after reverting `application.screenUpdating` to `true.

sa:

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range`] object.

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-selection[`.selection`] property of the
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[`application`] object returns the
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range that is currently selected.

  The method → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/inputBox[`application.inputBox`] allows a user to select a range with the mouse and pass the selected range to a VBA program.
