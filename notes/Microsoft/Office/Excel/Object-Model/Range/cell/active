$ Excel: active cell
@ active cell

There is always *one* active cell in each → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Window[window], even if the current selection contains multiple cells.

The keyboard shortcut key `F2` allows to edit the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas of the active cell.

sa:
  The currently → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell/active can be found with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-active-objects[`application.activeCell`].

  `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[application].moveAfterReturn` controls if the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell/active is moved when the Enter key is pressed. If `true`, it moves to the direction specified in `application.moveAfterReturnDirection`
