$ Excel Object Model: cell
@ cell

The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model[Excel object model] doesn't have a distinct object for a *cell*. Rather, a cell is represented by a
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range` object] that happens to be a 1x1 cell range.

A range that represents an arbitrary cell can be instantiated and accessed by giving the cell's address to the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range`] »constructor«:
gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/b3.bas||

The currently active cell can be found with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-active-objects[`application.activeCell`].

A cell can have a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Comment[comment] whose content is shown in a so-called «ballon».

{ Content of a cell

  A cell
    • is empty, or
    • stores a value (that has an associated → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[data type]), or
    • contains a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formula]

}
