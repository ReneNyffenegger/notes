$ Excel Object Model: cell
@ cell

The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model[Excel object model] doesn't have a distinct object for a *cell*. Rather, a cell is represented by a
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range` object] that happens to be a 1x1 cell range.

A range that represents an arbitrary cell can be instantiated and accessed by giving the cell's address to the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range`] »constructor«:
gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/b3.bas||

The currently → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell/active can be found with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-active-objects[`application.activeCell`].

A cell can have a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Comment[comment] whose content is shown in a so-called «ballon».

`→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[application].findFormat` sets (or returns) the criteria that are used to find cells with a specific formatting.

{ Content of a cell #xls-cell-content

  A cell is either
    • empty, or
    • stores a value (that has an associated → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[data type]), or
    • contains a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formula].

  In addition
    • a cell can be annotated with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Comment[comment] and(?)/or(?) note.
    • With → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/formatting/conditional, the visual appearance of the content changes according to (displayed) value of the cell.
    • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data/validation[Data validation] allows to define rules for values that are permitted to be entered into a cell

  When the content of a cell is modified, the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/_events[worksheet event] `change` is triggered.
