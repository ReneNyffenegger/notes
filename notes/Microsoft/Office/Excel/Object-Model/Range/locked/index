$ Excel Object Model: range.locked

By default, the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cells] of a (new) → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet are locked - but they still can be edited. In order to
protect locked cells from being edited by a user, the worksheet needs to be protected using
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/Home/Cells/Format/Protection[Home -> Cells -> Format -> Protect Sheet] or → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/Review/Protect/Protect-Sheet[Review -> Protect -> Protect Sheet].

sa:
  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/cell[worksheet function `cell(protect, reference)`] allows to determine if a cell is locked.

  Setting `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[application].dataEntryMode` to `xlOn` or `xlStrict` prevents a user from entering data into locked cells of the
  currently selected → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range.
