$ Excel: passing the value of a cell to a VBA function

Excel allows to call a custom → development/languages/VBA[VBA] functions from a worksheet and display the function's return value in a cell. In order to do that,
the cell's formula needs to be set to `=vbaFuncName()`.

It's also possible to pass values from other cells to the function. In that case, the function needs to have one (or more)
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[Range object] parameters. This is demonstrated in the following example:

gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/pass-cell-value-to-function.bas||

After executing `testData()`, the worksheet is filled as follows:

gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/img/pass-cell-value-to-function.png||

sa:
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model
