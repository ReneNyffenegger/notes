$ Excel: Range.numberFormat

A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range's] `numberFormat` property specifies how the underlying → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cells'] data is formatted.

`numberFormat` is technically a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/variant but seems to always be a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string that corresponds to the *Format Cells* dialog
(to be opened with right-click on a cell/range or via *Ribbon-Home* -> *Number*).


{ Format of the numberFormat value

  The value of `numberFormat` constists of one to up to four parts or elements which are separated from each other by a semicolon (`;`):
    • 1st element: positive numbers
    • 2nd element: negative numbers
    • 3rd element: value of zero
    • 4th element: format for text

  If only one element is given, it controls all numbers, positive and negative.

  In order to use the value of a cell whose → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[data type] is → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text[text], the *at sign* (`@`) must be used.

rem {
  It seems that the value of numberFormat is only considered if the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[data type] of the cell is → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/number except the 4th element is included in the `numberFormat` value.
rem }


  Some possible values for `numberFormat` are
    • `General`
    • `0.00`
    • `0.00;[Red]0.00`
    • `0.00_ ;-0.00`
    • `0.00_ ;[Red]-0.00`
    • `d/mm/yy;@`
    • `h:mm:ss;@`
    • etc.

} 
{ Formatting dates

  A number might be formatted according to → misc/ISO/8601 like so
code {
selection.numberFormat = "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
code }

   *Note*: the `mm` is interpreted as a two digit month number *unless* it follows a `hh` or preceedes an `ss` formatting instruction.
   -
   That is: a minute by itself cannot be displayed!

{ Inserting numbers (especially with leading zeroes) as text #excel-insert-number-as-text

 `rng.numberFormat = "@"` changes the data type of the content of a range to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/text. This allows to insert text that represent numbers, especially such with leading zeroes, as text, which left-aligns them.

  When doing that, Excel still believes this is an → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/error[error] and displays a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types/error#excel-green-triangle[green triangle] in the cell. To turn that triangle off,
  the `ignore` property of `errors(xlNumberAsText)` needs to be set to `true`.

}
{ Misc

  The underscore (`_`) is used to insert a space into the formatted result.
  -
? The underscore needs to be followed by a character whose width determines the width of the space that is inserted.
