$ Excel Object Model: Range.Address


`→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range].address` returns a textual representation (a string) of the range.

The returned value is independent from the current → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/referenceStyle[referenceStyle]. By default, the address is returned in absolute A1 style which can be demonstrated
with the following code in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window[immediate window]:
code {
application.ReferenceStyle = xlA1
? selection.address

application.ReferenceStyle = xlR1C1
? selection.address
code }

The `address` property has some parameters that alter the returned semantics of the address. This is demonstrated with the following
→ development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[VBA function]:
gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Range/address.bas||
