$ Excel object model: range.offset


`offset` has two optional parameters:
  • `rowOffset`
  • `columnOffset`

The following example first creates a 2-rows by 3 columns range (named `rng_orig`) and fills
it with the green text *orig*.

It then uses `offset()` on `rng_orig` to create another range (`rng_offset`) that is moved relatively to the original range. `rng_offset` is then filled with an orange color.

Finally, an anonymous range is created around which a blue border is drawn.
