This example tries to demonstrate how a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`range`] object is influenced if row or columns of the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] that the range is created from are deleted.

It turns out that the worksheet shrinks according to the deleted rows and columns.
