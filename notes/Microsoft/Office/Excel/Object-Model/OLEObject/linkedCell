$ Excel Object Model: OLEObject.LinkedCell

The value of `linkedCell` is the address of the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell whose value corresponds to the selected value, for example
in an MS Forms → development/languages/VBA/Useful-object-libraries/Microsoft-Forms/ComboBox.

The cell is updated when the user chooses a value, and vice verse, the combobox is updated when the value in the cell is modified.

Note, the datatype of this property is a `→ development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string`, therefore, it needs to be assigned the address of → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range], not the range object!


sa:
 `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/OLEObject`.
