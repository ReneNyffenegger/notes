$ Excel: evaluate expressions on the worksheet

It is possible to evaluate (mathematical) expressions on a worksheet and display the result.

The following example tries to demonstrate how this might be done with → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications:

gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Name/evaluate-expression.bas||

After running the program, the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet has the following expresssions and results.
gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Name/img/evaluate-expression.png||

This example roughly corresponds to the following GUI manipulations:
  • Enter some expressions (such as `2+3+4+5`)
  • Open → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/Formulas/Defined-Names/Define-Name[Formulas -> Defined Names -> Define Name]
  • Assign `evalExprToTheRight` to *Name*
  • Assign `=evaluate( expressions!rc[-1])` to *Refers To* (Be sure to use a relative referience)
  • Create a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formula] to the right of the expressions with the simple text `= evalExprToTheRight`


sa:
  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Name[`name`] object.
