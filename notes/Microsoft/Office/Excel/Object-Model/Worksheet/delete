$ Excel VBA: Worksheet.Delete

The `delete` method of a `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet` object deletes the worksheet

One might want to set → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/display/alerts[`application.displayAlerts`] to → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[`false`]
before deleting a worksheet so that the user is not prompted to confirm the deletion (Message Box with «Microsoft Excel will permantently delete shis sheet. Do you want to continue?»):
code {
dim ws as worksheet : set ws = sheets("fooBarBaz")
dim da as boolean   : da = application.displayAlerts
application.displayAlerts = false
ws.delete
application.displayAlerts = da
code }

sa:
  → development/languages/VBA/modules/Excel/ExcelHelpers#vba-mod-exh-deleteWorksheet[`deleteWorksheet()`] in → development/languages/VBA/modules/Excel/ExcelHelpers[ExcelHelpers].

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-key-shortcut[keyboard shortcut] `alt+h` -> `d` -> `s` -> `enter` deletes the current worksheet.
