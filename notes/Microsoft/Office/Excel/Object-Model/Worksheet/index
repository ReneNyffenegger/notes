$ Excel Object Model: Worksheet
@ worksheet

A worksheet belongs to *one* → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook]. 

The currently active worksheet can be found with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-active-objects[`application.activeSheet`].

→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/cells[`Worksheet.cells`] returns a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range` object] that consists of *all* cells in a Worksheet.

{ name

  Within a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook, a sheet is identified by a unique name. The name is subject to the following restrictions:
    • maximum length is 31 characters
    • the characters `\`, `/`, `?`, `*`, `[` and `]` are not allowed
    • the name cannot be empty (blank)


  { Name vs. Codename #xls-sheet-name-vs-codename

    A worksheet also has a `.codeName` property (as also have other objects such as a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Chart[`chart`]).

    These values are equal when the object is created but may be changed independently from each other.

    Apparently, the idea of code names is to use it in → development/languages/VBA like so (assuming that the `codename` property value of a sheet is `figures`.
code {
figures.cells(3, 2) = "Year 2019"
code }

    After creating a new → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook:
code {
sheet1.name = "bar" ' Changes name of tab
sheet1.name = "baz" ' Change it again
? worksheets("bar").codeName ' Evaluates to "sheet1"

'
'  Change code name of sheet is not possible at run time, so the
'  following line throws Run-time error 32183: Application-defined or object-defined error.
'
activeWorkbook.→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBProject[vbProject].→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBComponent[VBComponents]("Sheet1").name = "NewCodeNameForTheSheet"

'
'  Use new code name:
'
? newCodeNameForTheSheet.name ' Evaluates to "bar"
code }

    An example how the value of `.codeName` might be changed after creating w worksheet programmatically is found → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Excel/codeName[here].

  }

}
{ usedRange #excel-worksheet-usedRange

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/usedRange[`usedRange`] returns the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] that have had or still have a value.

}
{ calculate #excel-worksheet-calculate

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[Re-calculates the formulas] in a worksheet.

  A re-calculation of formulas can also be triggered with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[some `F9` keyboard shortcuts].

  If a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Workbook's] → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook#excel-workbook-forceFullCalculation[`forceFullCalculation`] property is set to true, the entire worksheet will be forced to be recalculated.

}
{ visible #excel-worksheet-visible

  A worksheet can be hidden by setting its property `.visible` to `xlSheetHidden` or `xlSheetVeryHidden`. If it is «only» hidden, the user sees the sheet name when right-clicking on any sheet name in the bottom of Excel.
  If the sheet is «very hidden», the user doesn't see the sheet anymore by clicking there.

  To show a sheet again with → development/languages/VBA, the property must be set to `xlSheetVisible`.
  -
  In the GUI, the visibility can be set in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor (→ Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-key-shortcut[keyboard shortcut] `alt+F11`) in the properties sheet object (found under *Microsoft Excel Objects*).

  See also the → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.xlsheetvisibility[`xlSheetVisibility`] enumeration.

{ evaluate #excel-worksheet-evaluate

 `worksheet.evaluate(formula)` evaluates a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formula] in the context of the worksheet on which `evaluate` was called. Compare with
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-evaluate[`application.evaluate`].

}

{ Deleting a worksheet

  One might want to set → Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/Application#ms-object-model-application-displayAlerts[`application.displayAlerts`] to → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/boolean[`false`] before deleting a worksheet
  so that the user is not prompted to confirm the deletion:
code {
dim ws as worksheet : set ws = sheets("fooBarBaz")
dim da as boolean   : da = application.displayAlerts
application.displayAlerts = false
ws.delete
application.displayAlerts = da
code }
