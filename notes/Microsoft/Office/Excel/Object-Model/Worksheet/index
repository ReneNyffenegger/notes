$ Office Object Model: Excel - Worksheet
@ worksheet

A worksheet belongs to *one* → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook]. 

The currently active worksheet can be found with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-active-objects[`application.activeSheet`].

→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/cells[`Worksheet.cells`] returns a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range` object] that consists of *all* cells in a Worksheet.

{ usedRange #excel-worksheet-usedRange

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/usedRange[`usedRange`] returns the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] that have had or still have a value.

}
{ calculate #excel-worksheet-calculate

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[Re-calculates the formulas] in a worksheet.

  A re-calculation of formulas can also be triggered with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[some `F9` keyboard shortcuts].

  If a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Workbook's] → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook#excel-workbook-forceFullCalculation[`forceFullCalculation`] property is set to true, the entire worksheet will be forced to be recalculated.

}
{ getWorksheet

 `getWorksheet` is a function that returns a worksheet with a given name.

  { Name vs. Codename

    A worksheet (as well as other objects such as a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Chart[`chart`]) has a `.name` and a `.codeName` property. These values are equal when
    the object is created but may be changed independently from each other.

    Apparently, the idea of code names is to use it in → development/languages/VBA like so (assuming that the code name of a sheet is `figures`):
code {
figures.cells(3, 2) = "Year 2019"
code }


  After creating a new → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook:
code {
sheet1.name = "bar" ' Changes name of tab
sheet1.name = "baz" ' Change it again
? worksheets("bar").codeName ' Evaluates to "sheet1"

'
'  Change code name of sheet:
'
activeWorkbook.→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBProject[vbProject].→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBComponent[VBComponents]("Sheet1").name = "NewCodeNameForTheSheet"

'
'  Use new code name:
'
? newCodeNameForTheSheet.name ' Evaluates to "bar"
code }

  { Hidden and very hidden sheets

    A worksheet can be hidden or very hidden, see the → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.xlsheetvisibility[`xlSheetVisibility`] enumeration).

  The visibility of *gridlines* cannot be changed on the `worksheet` object, it must be changed in the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Window[`window`] object (`displayGridlines = true|false`)

  A sheet can be copied to a new workbook with the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/copy#excel-worksheet-copy-to-new-workbook[`.copy`] method.

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/parent[`parent`] property.

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-key-shortcut[keyboard shorcuts] `ctrl+pageUp` and `ctrl+pageDown` rotate through worksheets.

  A worksheet's → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/AutoFilter[`autoFilter`] object allows to show or hide rows (that is: to filter the rows) based on criteria of the values on that sheet.

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Pages#pages-on-worksheet[Determining the number of pages] on a worksheet.

 The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/PageSetup[`PageSetup`] object control's a worksheet's pages attributes such as paper size, margins orientation etc.
