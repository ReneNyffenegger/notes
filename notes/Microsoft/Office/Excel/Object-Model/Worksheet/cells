  The range returned by `worksheet.cells` allows to select arbitrary cells on a worksheet. `….cells(R, C)` returns a range that represents the cell at row `R` and column `C`.
  Because `item` is the default property of a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`Range` object], `….cells(R, C)` is equivalent to `….cells.item(R, C)`.

  The following example chooses two cells that are used to define the upper left and bottom right cell of a range. Then, the cells in this range is assinged the value `X`:
