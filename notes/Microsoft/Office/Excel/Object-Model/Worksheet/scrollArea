$ Excel Object Model: Worksheet.scrollArea

The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet property `scrollArea` defines the the area within a user can scroll a worksheet.
-
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/cells[Cells] outside of this area cannot be selected.

The value of this property is a → development/languages/VBA/language/datatypes/string[string] representing the area in A1-reference style (see
→ https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/referenceStyle[`application.referenceStyle`]).

code {
activeSheet.scrollArea = range( _
   cells( 21,  3), _
   cells(125, 80)  _
).address
code }

In order to allow scrolling on the entire sheet, the value must be set to the empty string (`""`).
