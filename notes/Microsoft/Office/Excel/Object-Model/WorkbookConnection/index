$ Excel Object Model: WorkbookConnection

A `WorkbookConnection` objects stores the information that is required to obtain → development/Data from an *external data source* (that is: it is not stored within in the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[Workbook] itself).

The information of a workbook connection may be stored within the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook itself or externally in a *connection file* (with the extension
→ development/filename-extensions#odc[`.odc`], `iqy` etc.). If stored externally, these connections may be shared among multiple Excel developers. 

`WorkbookConnection` objects are stored in a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Connections[`Connections`] object which itself is found via `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook].connections`.
