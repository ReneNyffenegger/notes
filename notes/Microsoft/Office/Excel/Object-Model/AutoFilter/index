$ Office Object Model: Excel - AutoFilter
@ AutoFilter

An `AutoFilter` object allows to hide or show rows based on criterias put on the values in the cells of these rows. Thus, it somewhat corresponds to an
→ development/databases/SQL/where[SQL's `where` clause].

{ Basic example

  The following simple example tries to demonstrate how an `autoFilter` object might be used.

  The example also prints the values the worksheet's `.autoFilterMode` and `.filterMode` properties a few times. The meaning of these properties is:
    • `autoFilterMode`, if `true`: drop down triangles are shown
    • `filterMode`, if `true` at least one filter is active, thus some rows might be hidden.
