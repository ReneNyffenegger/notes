$ Using Excel's AutoFilter object in the Immediate Window

Sometimes, it's easier to use Excel's → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/AutoFilter[`AutoFilter` object] in the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/AutoFilter/immediate-window.

The following fragmens assume that a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range is selected whose top row has the headings and rest contains the data to be filtered.

Filter the range on its second and fourth columns:
code {
selection.autoFilter 2, ">10"  , xlAnd, "<99"
selection.autoFilter 4, ">qqq"
code }

Remove the condition of the second column:
code {
selection.autoFilter 2
code }

Modify (override) the condition of the fourth column:
code {
selection.autofilter 3, ">yyy"
code }

Turn off auto filtering:
code {
activeSheet.autofiltermode= false
code }
