$ Excel Object Model: Application.onTime

`Application.onTime` can be used to schedule the execution of a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[procedure].

Apparently, it's not a trivial task to pass parameters to a scheduled execution.

Run a procedure at 5 PM:
code {
application.onTime timeValue("00:01:00"), "someProcedure"
code }

In order to schedule the exection after a given amount of time (as opposed to fix point in time), the following construct can be used:
code {
application.onTime → development/languages/VBA/functions#vba-now[now] + timeValue("00:01:00"), "someProcedure"
code }

sa:
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/wait[`application.wait`] and
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-run[`application.run`].

  The → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[`application` object].
