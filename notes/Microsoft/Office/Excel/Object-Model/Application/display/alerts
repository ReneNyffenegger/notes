$ Excel Object Model: Application.DisplayAlerts

The boolean value of `application.displayAlerts` controls whether Excel prompts the user for a response using a message box or just assumes the action's default value.

This value is typically set to `false` when executing → development/languages/VBA macros that should run through without user interaction.

A typical situation where the user interaction might be desired to be prevented is the `saveAs()` metho of the
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook object.

sa:
  `displayAlerts` as → Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/Application#ms-object-model-applicaion-version[common property in other Office `application` objects].
