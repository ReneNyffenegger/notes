$ Excel Object Model: Application.Selection
@ selection

The `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[application].selection` returns the currently selected object, for example a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`range`] or `picture` object.
-
The object type which `selection` refers to can be determined with → development/languages/VBA/functions/typeName[`typename(selection)`] which returns `Range`, `Picture` etc.

When the current selection changes, the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet/_events[worksheet event] `selectionChange` is fired.

A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] can be selected with the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/select[`range.select` method].
