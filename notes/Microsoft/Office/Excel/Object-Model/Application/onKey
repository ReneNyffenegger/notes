$ Excel Object Model: Application.onKey


application.onKey` allows to programatically set a shortcut key to invoke a function.

table { ll
  `call application.onKey("^q"   , "ctrl_q" )` ☰ Map *ctrl+q* to the sub `ctrl_q`
  `call application.onKey("%a"   , "alt_a"  )` ☰ Map *alt+a* to the sub `alt_a`
  `call application.onKey("+s"   , "shift_s")` ☰ Map *shift+s* to the sub `shift_s`
  `call application.onKey("{F12}", "f_12"   )` ☰ Map a function-key.
table }

In order to disable an association, the second parameter must be omitted:
code {
call application.onKey("^q")
code }

{ Lifespan and scope of shortcut keys

  The assigned short cut keys are stored with the application (not the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook) until the Excel instance is shut down.

  Because a shortcut is not associated with a Workbook, the same shortcut key cannot be assigned to a per-Workbook function at the same time.

  a keyboard shortcut key (at least in Excel).
