$ Excel Object Model: Application.caller

In certain situations, `application.caller` returns some information on what caused the invocation of a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[`sub` or `function`]:

`→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[application].caller` is especially useful in a function that is called from a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell (`=func()). In that case, its value is
a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range] that corresponds to the cell in which this formula is located.

For the four (obsolete) functions `auto_open`, `auto_close`, `auto_activate` and `auto_deactivate`, `application.caller` evaluates to the name of the corresponding document.
