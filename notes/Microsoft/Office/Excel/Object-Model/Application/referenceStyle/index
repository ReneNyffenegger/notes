$ Office Object Model: Excel - Application.ReferenceStyle

Excel has two → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-cell-address[reference styles] which can be chosen by assigning one of the two values `xlA1` or `xlR1C1` to `application.referenceStyle`.

{ Influence on column headers

  With the *A1* reference style in effect, → Microsoft/Office/Excel displays letters as column headers:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Application/referenceStyle/img/cols-A1.png||

  With *R1C1* reference style, column numbers are displayed instead:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Application/referenceStyle/img/cols-R1C1.png||

}

sa:

  The function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/convertFormula[`application.convertFormula()`] converts → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/address[range addresses]
  (for example in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formulas]) between the two reference style and/or between relative and absolute addresses.

  The returned value of → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/address[`range.address`] is not influenced by the currently active reference style.

? `SparklineGroups.add()` can only be executed when the reference style is set to A1.
