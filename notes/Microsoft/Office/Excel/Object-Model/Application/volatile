$ Excel Object Model: Application.volatile

`application.volatile` can be used to mark a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[user defined function] as *volatile* which affects when
this function is called for → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[formula recalculation purposes].

In order to have any effect, this statement must be placed within a user defined function that is used for cell calculation.

A *volatile function* is always called when
  • The value of *any* cell changes on the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet]
  • One of the `F9` → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-recalculation[recalculation] shortcut keys is pressed.

In contrast, the *non-volatile function* is only called by pressing
  • `ctrl+alt+F9`
  • `ctrl+alt+shift+F9`


{ Example VBA module

  The following → development/languages/VBA/language/module[VBA module] defines a volatile, a non-volatile function and a function (`main`) that sets up a
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] in order to be able to experiment with the volatility of VBA functions:
