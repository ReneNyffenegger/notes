$ Excel Object Model:  Application.cutCopyMode

The value of `application.cutCopyMode` indicates if there is something ready either to be copy-pasted or cut-pasted. There are three possible values:
table { ll
  `false` (= 0) ☰ Nothing is selected to be cut-pasted or copy pasted
  `xlCopy` (= 1) ☰ Selection will be copied to destination
  `xlCut` (= 2) ☰ Selection will be cut out from source and copied to destination
table }

If → Microsoft/Office/Excel is either in copy or cut mode, the selected region is displayed with a dashed green border. Otherwise, the selection has a solid green border.

  In the following image, cutCopyMode is `xlCopy`, so the border is green-dashed. Unfortunately, whes using → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/SnippingTool_exe[`SnippingTool.exe`] to take a scren shot, the
  dashed border is lost. Hence, the picture shows it (wrongly) in solid.

  The border is drawn green-dashed, here also, but again copied wrongly by `SnippingTool.exe`.

  Here's the same problem as before: the border is originally drawn green-dashed, but because of the limitation of `SnippingTool.exe`, it is solid again:
