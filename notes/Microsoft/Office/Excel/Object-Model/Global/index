$ Excel Object Model: Global
@ Global

Excel's `Global` object is a hidden object that allows to refer to objects in VBA code in an abbreviated form, for example simply `cells` instead of
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/cells[`application.cells`].

Because the object is hidden, it can be seen in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Browser only if showing hidden members is explicitely enabled (right click).

  When researching the `Global` object the following two Stackoverflow answers were particularly helpful to me:
