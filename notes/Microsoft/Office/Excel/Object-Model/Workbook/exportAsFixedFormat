$ Excel Object Model: workbook.exportAsFixedFormat

The `exportAsFixedFormat` method of a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[`workbook`] object publishes the content of a workbook either in the
→ design/graphic/pdf or XPS format.

{ Export a subset of the available worksheets

 It is also possible to use `→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Sheets[sheets](→ development/languages/VBA/language/arrays/[array](… ))` to select a subset of the available sheets in a workbook to be printed.
 This is demonstrated with the following simple example:

  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Workbook/exportAsFixedFormat.bas||

}

sa:

  Selecting multiple sheets → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook/worksheets/write-to-mutliple-sheets[to write on them concurrently].

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model
