$ Excel Object Model: Workbook.Path

`workbook.path` evaluates to the filesystem directory (without file name) where the corresponding → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook is stored.

In order to get the *full path* (i. e. *with* file name), use the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook/fullName[`fullName`] property, or the more explicit construct:
code {
wb.path & "\" & wb.name
code }

sa:
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook
