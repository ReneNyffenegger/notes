$ Office Object Model: Excel - Workbook
@ workbook

A *Workbook object* is the object that corresponds to an Excel file (`*.xlsm`, `*.xlsx`, etc.).

A *workbook* consisist of multiple → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheets].

The currently active workbook can be found with → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-active-objects[`application.activeWorkbook`].
-
The workbook in which a macro is running is returned by → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-thisWorkbook[`application.thisWorkbook`].

A workbook has *one* corresponding → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model/VBProject[VBProject] in the
→ Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model[VBE object model]. It can be accessed by the `vbProject` property of the workbook.

{ fileFormat

  `fileFormat` returns a document's format, an example is → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook/fileFormat[here].

}
{ fullName #excel-worksbook-fullName

 `fullName` returns path and file name of the worksheet:
  gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/Workbook/fullName.bas||

  Compare with the Excel function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-cell-filename[`cell(filename…)`].

}
{ forceFullCalculation #excel-workbook-forceFullCalculation

  If `forceFullCalculation` is set to `true`, → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet#excel-worksheet-calculate[`calculate()`] (on → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[`worksheet`] object) will calculate every formula, regardless of
  dependencies.

? When excel is restarted, `forceFullCalculation` will be reset to false again.

}
{ path

  `….path` returns the directory where the respective workbook is stored.

}
{ protect / unprotect

  Calling `protect` protects a workbook. Optionally, the function can be given a → development/security/password that is needed to `unprotect` it.

  Apparently, a protected workbook just prevents adding, deleting, showing or hiding → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[workhseets].

code {
activeWorkbook.protect("secretPassword")
code }

  Repeal the protection: 
code {
activeWorkbook.unprotect("secretPassword")
code }

}
{ saveAs

  `saveAs` saves an excel document to disk and allows to specify the file name and → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook/fileFormat[file format].
