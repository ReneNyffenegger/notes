$ Excel: insert directory of workbook into a cell

The following code snippet is an attempt to demonstrate how it is possible to
insert the directory name of an Excel → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook into a
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell.

This is possible because → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/parent[`range.parent.parent`] returns the workbook object in which `range` is located. This object's `path` property is
the directory name that we're interested in.

So, in the cell where we want to display the directory value, we have to insert a formula that calls a → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[user defined function]
(`worksheetDirectory()`) that evaluates this expression.

When `main` is executed, it creates → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet that looks like so:
gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/parent/img/excelDirectory.png||
