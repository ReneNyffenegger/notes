$ Office Object Model: Excel - Parent 

The objects → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[range], → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] and
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbook] each have a `parent` property which returns the instance of which they're part of: `range.parent` returns a worksheet,
`worksheet.parent` returns a workbook, `workbook.parent` returns an → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[`Application` object].

The following piece of code tries to demonstrate that:
gh|about-MS-Office-object-model|/Excel/parent/chain.bas||

code {
Range -> Worksheet
Worksheet -> Workbook
Workbook -> Application
code }

sa:

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/parent/insert-workbook-directory[Insert a workbook's directory name into a cell]
  
 → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model
