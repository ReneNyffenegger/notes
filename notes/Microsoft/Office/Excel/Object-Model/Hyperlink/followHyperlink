$ Excel Object Model: hyperlink event followHyperlink

`FollowHyperlink` is the → development/languages/VBA/language/classes/event that is triggered when a user clicks on a
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Hyperlink[`hyperlink`]. Because the event is delivered to a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[`worksheet`], the
name of the → development/languages/VBA/language/subs-and-functions[sub] must be declared as `worksheet_followHyperlink` and created in the worksheet's code module.

? This event is not triggered when a user clicks on a cell with a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/hyperlink[`=hyperlink(…)`] formula.
