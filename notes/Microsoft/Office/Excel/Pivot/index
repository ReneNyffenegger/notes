{ Visual changes when PivotTable is selected

  When a PivotTable is selected on a WorkSheet, the Ribbon adds *PivotTable Tools* with the associated menus *Analyze* and *Design*. 

  In addition, Excel also shows the *PivotTable Fields* side bar which allows to
    • select the fields for the PivotTable
    • drag fields between columns, rows or select them for values or use them as data-filtes. By default, non-numeric fields are added to columns, date and time hierarchies to columns and numeric fields to values.

}

{ Misc

  In → development/Software/LibreOffice/Calc prior to version 3.4, the feature that corresponded to Excel's PivotTable was named *DataPilot*.
