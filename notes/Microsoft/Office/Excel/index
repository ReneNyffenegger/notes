{ Keyboard shortcuts

  Change sheets: `ctrl + pageUp` / `ctrl + pageDown`

  Select entire column or column: `ctrl + space` (row), `shift + space` (column).

  Turn selected region into *data table*: `ctrl-t`.

  Add total column to data table: `ctrl-shift-t`.

  { Automatically installing a shortcut to calling a sub when an excel is opened

code {
sub auto_open()

end sub
code  }

{ Display Developer tab on Ribbon #excel-display-developer-tab

  In order to have the *record macro* button, the *Developer tab* must be first enabled.

  This can be done in the → Windows/registry[registry] under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Excel/Options#reg-excel-developer-tools[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\_version_\Excel\Options`]
  (value `DeveloperTools`).

  Alternatively, the developer tools can also be enabled via the menu: File -> Options -> Customize Ribbon -> Check *Developer* box on right side.

}
{ Reference style for cell addresses #excel-cell-address

  Each cell on an excel → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] has a unique address. There are two
  so called *reference styles* for these addresses:
    • A1 style
    • R1C1 style

  The A1 style seems to be default: other cells are referenced by the `D5` syntax. (fourth column, 5th row)

  With R1C1, cells can be addressed with `R[-3]C[2]` which is the value of the cell 3 rows above and 2 columns to the right.

  The reference style can be changed through the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[Application] object:
code {
application.referenceStyle = xlR1C1 ' or
application.referenceStyle = xlA1
code }

  It can also be changed through *File -> Options -> Formulas* and (un-)ticking *R1C1 reference style*.

  See also the Excel functions → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-row-column[functions `row` and `column`] and
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-row-column[`address`].

  In → Microsoft/Office/Excel/table[Excel tables], data can be accessed using the so called ~structured references~.

  It seems (at least to me) that the reference style cannot be *permanently stored* except when using a
  → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel/XLSTART/Personal_xlsb[Personal.xlsb] file.

{ Misc
