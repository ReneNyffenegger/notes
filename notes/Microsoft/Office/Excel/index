{ Reference style for cell addresses #excel-cell-address

  Each cell on an excel → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] has a unique address. There are two
  so called *reference styles* for these addresses:
    • A1 style
    • R1C1 style

  The A1 style seems to be default: other cells are referenced by the `D5` syntax. (fourth column, 5th row)

  With R1C1, cells can be addressed with `R[-3]C[2]` which is the value of the cell 3 rows above and 2 columns to the right.

  The reference style can be changed through the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[Application] object:
code {
application.referenceStyle = xlR1C1 ' or
application.referenceStyle = xlA1
code }

  It can also be changed through *File -> Options -> Formulas* and (un-)ticking *R1C1 reference style*.

  See also the Excel functions → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-row-column[functions `row` and `column`] and
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-row-column[`address`].

  In → Microsoft/Office/Excel/table[Excel tables], data can be accessed using the so called ~structured references~.
