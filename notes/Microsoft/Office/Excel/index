  A → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] contains a maximum of 1,048,576 rows and a maximum of 16,384 columns. This corresponds to 17,179,869,184 cells.

{ Keyboard shortcuts

  Some keyboard shortcuts I found useful the other day are …

  Change sheets: `ctrl + pageUp` / `ctrl + pageDown`

  Select entire column or column: `ctrl + space` (row), `shift + space` (column).

  Turn selected region into *data table*: `ctrl-t`.
  -
  Add total column to data table: `ctrl-shift-t`.

 `ctrl+q` opens the query input box (which allows to search for keywords)

 `ctrl+1` opens the *format cells* dialog.

 `ctrl+9` / `ctrl+0` hides selected rows / columns.

 `ctrl+F3` open *name manager* (which is found in the ribbon/menu under *formulas*).

 `shift+F10` opens the *context menu*.
 
 `alt+F11` opens the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor.

 `alt+=` inserts a `=sum(…)`

  { Select tabs on the ribbon

    Some `alt+…` combinations select a tab and then allow to select an item on the tab with another key which is displayed next to the element:
     • `alt+f` file page, use backstage view
     • `alt+h` home tab
     • `alt+p` page layout tab
     • `alt+n` insert tab
     • `alt+m` formula tab
     • `alt+w` view tab

    `F10` shows the keys to be pressed next to the respective tab-selector.

    `ctrl+F1` shows or hides the ribbon bar

  }

  { Automatically installing a shortcut to calling a sub when an excel is opened

code {
sub auto_open()
    → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application#excel-application-onKey[application.onKey] "{F12}", "nameOfSubToCall"
end sub
code  }


  }

}
{ Display Developer tab on Ribbon #excel-display-developer-tab

  In order to have the *record macro* button, the *Developer tab* must be first enabled.

  This can be done in the → Windows/registry[registry] under
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Excel/Options#reg-excel-developer-tools[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\_version_\Excel\Options`]
  (value `DeveloperTools`).

  Alternatively, the developer tools can also be enabled via the menu: File -> Options -> Customize Ribbon -> Check *Developer* box on right side.

}
{ Reference style for cell addresses #excel-cell-address

  Each cell on an excel → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet] has a unique address. There are two
  so called *reference styles* for these addresses:
    • A1 style
    • R1C1 style

  The A1 style seems to be default: other cells are referenced by the `D5` syntax. (fourth column, 5th row)

  With R1C1, the syntax for *relative addresses* of cells is `R[-3]C[2]` which is the value of the cell 3 rows above and 2 columns to the right.
  -
  The syntax for *absolute addresses* is `R4C2` which represents the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cell] in the 4th row and 2nd column.

  The reference style can be changed through the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[Application] object:
code {
application.referenceStyle = xlR1C1 ' or
application.referenceStyle = xlA1
code }

  It can also be changed through *File -> Options -> Formulas* and (un-)ticking *R1C1 reference style*.

  See also the Excel functions → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-row-column[functions `row` and `column`] and
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions#excel-func-row-column[`address`].

  In → Microsoft/Office/Excel/table[Excel tables], data can be accessed using the so called ~structured references~.

  It seems (at least to me) that the reference style cannot be *permanently stored* except when using a
  → Windows/dirs/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel/XLSTART/Personal_xlsb[Personal.xlsb] file.

{ Misc

  On → Linux, there is `sc`, the command line spread sheet.
