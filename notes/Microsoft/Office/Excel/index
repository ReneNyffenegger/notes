{ Reference style

  There are two so called *reference styles* to refer to the value of other cells in a cell's formula:
    • A1 style
    • R1C1 style

  The A1 style seems to be default: other cells are referenced by the `D5` syntax. (fourth column, 5th row)

  With R1C1, cells can be addressed with `R[-3]C[2]` which is the value of the cell 3 rows above and 2 columns to the right.

  The reference style can be changed through the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[Application] object:
code {
application.referenceStyle = xlR1C1 ' or
application.referenceStyle = xlA1
code }

  It can also be changed through *File -> Options -> Formulas* and (un-)ticking *R1C1 reference style*.
