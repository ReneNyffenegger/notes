$ Excel: Power-Pivot (menu)

In order to have → Microsoft/Office/Excel show the *Power Pivot* tab on the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon[Ribbon bar], the *Data Analyis* → Microsoft/Office/add-in[add-in] must be enabled. This can be done
using the menu → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/Data/Data-Tools/Manage-Data-Model[Data -> Data Tools -> Manage Data Model].
