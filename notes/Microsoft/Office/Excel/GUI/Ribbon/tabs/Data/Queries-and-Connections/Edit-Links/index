{ Break Link not working

  I once encountered an Excel sheet where another workbook/sheet was referenced but *Break Link* would not work: although I could click the button and Excel reminded me that
 «breaking links permanently converts formulas and external references to their existing values», the links were not removed.

  I was able to find the cells with the references via
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/File/Info/Check-for-Issues[File -> Info -> Check for Issues], then choosing *Check Compatibility* which showed a «summary» of cells that contained
  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Validation[data validation rules] which referred referred values of the other worksheet.
  -
  After using this functionality to select the cells with references, I could remove the validation rules in the → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Immediate-Window with
code {
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application/selection[selection].validation.delete
code }

}
{ TODO

  The `updateLinks` property of the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[`workbook`] object can be set to one of the values of the
  → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.xlupdatelinks[`xlUpdateLinks`] enumeration:
  table { lr
    `xlUpdateLinksAlways` ☰ 3
    `xlUpdateLinksNever` ☰ 2
    `xlUpdateLinksUserSetting` ☰ 1
  table }

code {
activeWorkbook.updateLinks = xlUpdateLinksAlways
code }

}
sa:

  Apparently, some (or all?) links can be found with → development/languages/VBA[VBA] using the function → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook/linkSources[`workbook.linkSources`].
