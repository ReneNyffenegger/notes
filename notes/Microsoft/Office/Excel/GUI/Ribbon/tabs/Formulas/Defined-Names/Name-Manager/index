$ Excel: Formulas -> Defined Names -> Name Manager

The *Name Manager* is used to create, edit and delete names that refer to → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[ranges] or → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/array/constants[array constants].

After defining such names, these names can be used in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formulas] and especially in → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[worksheet functions] as substitutes for the range (reference) or values in the array
they were defined for. This allows to create cleaner and more comprehensible formulas.

The name manager also allows to to find already defined names.

The *Name Manager* can be opened with the → Microsoft/Office/Excel#excel-key-shortcut[keyboard shortcut] `ctrl+F3`.
