$ Excel: View (Ribbon Tab)

It seems that most configurations that are made on the *View tab* pertain to the *active → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Window[window]* only.
- 
A notable exception is → Microsoft/Office/Excel/GUI/Ribbon/tabs/View/Show[View -> Show] -> Formula Bar which is reflected on all windows
