$ Excel: circular reference


If Excel detects a circular reference on the same → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[sheet] as the user is currently working on, this is displayed in the bottom left corner of the Excel application. The text *circular reference* is followed by the
→ Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range#excel-range-address[address] of the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell where the circular reference is found:

However, if the circular reference is on another sheet, only the text *circular reference is displayed:

In such cases, the location fo circular references can be found using the tab *Formulas*, and then by selecting *Error Checking* from *Formula Auditing* (text hidden in picutre):
