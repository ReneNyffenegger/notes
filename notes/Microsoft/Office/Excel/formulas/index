$ Excel formulas

An *→ Microsoft/Office/Excel[Excel] formula* starts with an equal sign (`=`), a plus (`+`) or a minus (`-`).

A formula contains a combination of
  • constants
  • cell references
  • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions[functions]
  • operators
  • … (?)


{ Display formula text

  *ctrl+`* (gravis) switches between displaying formula-text and formula-result.

  If in *show formula text* mode, the resulting value of a specific formula can be shown by pressing `F2` on the cell with the formula fo

}
{ Intersect operator #excel-intersect-operator

  A *space* is the ~intersect operator~. It's possible to write formulas such as the following which
  calculates the sum of the number in `F10:F12`
code {
=sum(F9:F12 F10:F15)
code }

  An intersection that returns an empty set is shown with the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell/errors[`#NULL!` cell error].

}
{ Recalculation #excel-formula-recalculation

  Keyboard shortcuts around `F9` can be used to perform or force recalculation of Excel formulas:
    • `F9` calculates all → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheets] in all open → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Workbook[workbooks]
    • `alt+F9` calculates the active → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheets]
    • `ctrl+alt+F9` *forces* the recalculation in all worksheets of open workbooks, *even* if Excel thinks they have not changed
    • `ctr+alt+shift+F9` calculates dependent → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/cell[cell]

  The corresponding → development/languages/VBA[VBA] method is → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet#excel-worksheet-calculate[`calculate`] (on a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[`Worksheet`] object).
