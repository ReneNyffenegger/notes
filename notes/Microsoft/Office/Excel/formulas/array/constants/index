$ Excel: array constants

An *array constant* is a list of elements within curly braces. The elements are seperated by either a comma or a semicolon. A comma indicates that the element is in the same row but one cell to the right of
the previous element while a semicolon starts a new row.

Array constants need to be inserted as → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/array[array formulas].

An element in an array constant can contain all (or almost all?) → Microsoft/Office/Excel/data-types[Excel data types] but cannot be a (nested) array constant.
