$ Excel: array formulas

{ Entering array formulas

  In older versions of Excel, an *array formula* is entered by pressing `ctrl+shift+enter`. This is why they're also referred to as *control-shift-enter* or *CSE* formulas.

  Recent versions of → Microsoft/365 have introduced → #excel-dynamic-array-formulas[dynamic array formulas] which allow to simply enter the formula in the top left cell of the output area and then pressing enter.

? After having entered the array formula, they're visually distiguished from «ordinary» formulas by embedding them in curly braces.

  In order to assign an array formula to a → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range[`range`] with → development/languages/VBA, the range's property
 → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/formula/array[`formulaArray`] must be used instead of `formula`.

}
{ Two types of array formulas

  There are two types of array → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas[formulas]:
    • Formulas that aggregate arrays into a single value (`sum`, `average`, `count`, …)
    • Formulas that return an array (whose values are spread into multiple adjacent cells, for example → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/array/countifs[`countifs(…, {…})`]

}
{ Spilling

  With the September 2018 update of Microsoft 365, the values of a formula that returns an array, are *spilled* over adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically. This behavior
  is referred to as *spilling*.

}
{ Dynamic array formulas #excel-dynamic-array-formulas

  A *dynamic array formula* is a formula that returns an array of variable length.

  The values of the returned array are then spilled onto the neighbouring cells of the cell where the formula is located. Thus, they eliminate the
  need for legacy *control shift enter* (CSE) array formula.

  With the introduction of dynamic array formulas in Excel, the default → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas#excel-formula-eval-mode[formula evaluation mode] is
 *array evaluation*.
  -
  As part of this introduction, Excel also introduced the → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/operators/intersection#excel-impl-intersect-op[implicit intersection operator `@`].

  In a formula, the values of the formula that returns an array of variable length can be referred to with the cell address plus the hash symbol, for example
    • Formula in B1: `=unique(A1:A100)
    • Formula in C1: `=sort(B3#)`

}

sa:

  A typical example for a function that needs to be entered as a control-shift-enter formula seems to be → Microsoft/Office/Excel/functions/transpose[`transpose`]

  → Microsoft/Office/Excel/formulas/array/constants[Array constants]
