$ Visio VBA: laying out shapes on a page

The following is a attempt to create a dependency chart. With â†’ tools/Graphviz[Graphviz] this is a breeze, the result of my attempt however is rather dissapointing, I feel the result could look much nicer.

Apparently, in order to create nicer drawings, the behaviour of `layout` should be changed by setting and modifying formulas of cells in the *Page Layout* and *Shape Layout* Shape Sheet sections of the particular page.

Since I haven't done that, this might explain why the result is not that beautiful.
