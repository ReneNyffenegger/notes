$ Microsoft Office Click-to-Run

Office Click-to-Run installs required Office functionality with *streaming techology* which is compared to watching a video: it is not necessary to have downloaded the entire movie to start watching it. Same thing with
the application which will be downloaded as the user is using it.

So, Office Click-to-Run is *not* a new Office prodct, rather, it's a new method of delivering and updating the product.

? Click-to-Run uses or relies on *virtualization technology*.

A Click-to-Run application executes in a *virtual application environment* (on the local machine). So, the modifications within this virtual environment don't interfere with the surrounding «real» components on a computer.

There might be a (virtual) `Q:\` drive which is the virtual file system that is used by Click-to-Run.
