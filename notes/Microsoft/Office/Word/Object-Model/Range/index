$ Office Object Model: Word - Range

A *Range* object applies to a continuous section in a document. The range is delimited (or defined) by its starting and end position.

A Range object only exists while the procedure that defined it is running.

Compare the *Range* object with the → Microsoft/Office/Word/Object-Model/Selection[Selection] object.

{ End of document

  At times, it is necessary to obtain a range that represents the (single point) of the end of a → Microsoft/Office/Word/Object-Model/Document[document].

  It seems that this is possible with the following function (although I am not sure that this is really the most efficient and\
  preferred way to do that):
code {
function endOfDocument(doc as document) as range ' {

    set endOfDocument = doc.content
    endOfDocument.collapse wdCollapseEnd

end function ' }
code }

}
