{ Misc

  After translating a Word document with → https://www.deepl.com[DeepL], the translated Document was protected from editing (Ribbon *Review*, button *Restrict Editing*). It turned out, that a
  → development/security/password was needed to allow editing again. I was able to make the document editable by exporting it as `*.rtf` file, then removing `{\*\passwordhash …}` from the `*.rtf` file and
  opening this `*.rtf` file in word again.
