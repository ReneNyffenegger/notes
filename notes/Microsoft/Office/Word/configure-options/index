$ MS Word: configure options with PowerShell

Apparently, → Microsoft/Office/Word[MS Word] stores the settings in the → Windows/registry[registry] in a binary (!) value under
→ Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Word/Data[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\X.Y\Word\Data`]. Thus, configuring word directly via
→ Windows/registry/regedit or → Windows/registry/reg is not advisable.

However, → Windows/PowerShell makes it quite easy to configure the settings from a script.

Of course, you'll want to change the `$true` and `$false` values according to your preferences…

sa:
  The → Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/scripts#vba-diff-object-properties[`diff-object-properties.bas`] script was quite helpful in determining the names of the properties.

  It seems that Word options can be resetted by deleting the entire → Windows/registry[registry] key
  → Windows/registry/tree/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/application_version/Word[`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\X.Y\Word`]
