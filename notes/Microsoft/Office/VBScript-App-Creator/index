$ VBScript MS-Office App Creator

This page describes a lightweight → development/languages/VBScript library that I routinely use to create Office applications (Access, Excel or Word documents with → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] modules)
from the command line (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[`cmd.exe`] or → Windows/PowerShell).

The source code is → #office-app-creator-source-code[here (`create-MS-Office-app.vbs`)] or on → https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/VBS-MS-Office-App-Creator[github].

{ Subs and Functions

  table { ll

    → #createOfficeApp[`createOfficeApp(prod, fileName)`] ☰ Creates an Office document (`.docm`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsb` or `.accdb`, depending on the value of `prod` and or → development/filename-extensions[extension] of `fileName`). If the document alread exists, it is deleted.
    → #openOfficeApp[`openOfficeApp(prod, fileName)`] ☰ Opens an Office document. Unlike `createOfficeApp()`, no attempt is made to delete it it exists.
    → #insertModule[`insertModule(app, moduleFilePath, moduleName, moduleType)`] ☰ Add a → development/languages/VBA/language/module[VBA module] to the application. If module with same name already exists, it is replaced.
    → #addReference[`addReference(app, guid, major, minor)`] ☰ Add a reference to a → Windows/development/COM/type-library aka typelib.
    → #currentDir[`currentDir()`] ☰ Returns the path of the current directory with a trailing back slash (`\`)
    → #replaceThisWorksheetModuleMOdule[`replaceThisWorksheetModuleMOdule(app, moduleFilePath)`] ☰ Set the content of an Excel's `ThisWorksheet`

  table }

  { createOfficeApp #createOfficeApp

  `createOfficeApp(prod, fileName)` creates an Office document or an → development/databases/Access database.

   The first parameter (`application`) is a string that determines what is to be created. Its value must be one of `word`, `excel` or `access`.
   -
   The second parameter (`fileName`) controls the filename of the document/database that is created. If the file already exists, it is deleted.

code {
set doc = createOfficeApp("word"  , "p:\ath\to\word\document.docm"   )
set xls = createOfficeApp("excel" , "p:\ath\to\excel\worksheet.xlsm" )
set acc = createOfficeApp("access", "p:\ath\to\access\database.accdb")
code }

  }
  { openOfficeApp #openOfficeApp

   `openOfficeApp(prod, fileName)` opens an Office document for further manipulation.

    The meaning of the parameters of `openOfficeApp(prod, fileName)` are the same as those of → #createOfficeApp[`createOfficeApp(prod, filename)`].

    Currently (version 0.03), only `prod = excel` is implemented.
code {
set xls = openOfficeApp("excel"  , "p:\ath\to\excel\worksheet.xlsm")
code }

  }
  { insertModule #insertMOdule

   `insertModule(app, moduleFilePath, moduleName, moduleType)` inserts a → development/languages/VBA/language/module[VBA module].

    `app` must be an application object
      • → Microsoft/Office/Word/Object-Model/Application[`Word.Application`],
      • → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Application[`Excel.Application`] or
      • `Access.Application`
     -
     For Word and Excel documents, the required application object is obtained by using the `.application` property on the object that is returned by `createOfficeApp(…)`.

    `moduleFilePath` is a string that locates the file path of the module that is to be inserted.

    `moduleName` is the name that will be assigned to the inserted module. If there is already a module with this name, it will be replaced.

    `moduleType` is an integer that describes what type of module is to be inserted. The possible values are `1` and `2`. They correspond to the constants `vbext_ct_StdModule` and `vbext_ct_ClassModule`.
    
     An → #office-app-creator-examples[example] that demonstrate how `insertModule()` replaces a module is → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Excel/add-module[here].

  }
  { addReference #addReference

   `addReference(app, guid, major, minor)` adds a reference to a → Windows/development/COM/type-library aka typelib. (See for example → Microsoft/Office/Visual-Basic-Editor/Object-Model#vbe-add-reference[Adding a reference to a library programmatically]).

   `app` has the same meaning as in → #insertMOdule[`insertModule(…)`]

   `guid` is the → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] the uniquely identifies the type library whose reference is to be added.

   `major` and `minor` specify the type library's version.

  }
  { currentDir #currentDir

   `currentDir()` returns the current directory with a trailing backslash (`\`) so that it can be easily concatenated with the relative path names of files, especially in conjunction with inserting modules 
   (→ #insertModule[`insertModule()`])

  }
  { replaceThisWorksheetModuleMOdule #replaceThisWorksheetModuleMOdule

   `replaceThisWorksheetModuleMOdule(app, moduleFilePath)` is quite similar to `insertModule()` but can only be used for an Excel application in order to insert a `ThisWorksheet` module.

    See → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Excel/workbook_open[this example] that demonstrates this function.

{ Examples #office-app-creator-examples

  The three *simple* examples for → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Access/simple[Access],
  → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Excel/simple[Excel] and
  → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Word[Word] are very similar: The create the respective Office document and
  insert a module, named `functions.bas` which has one `sub`, named `main` which calls `msgBox()` to demonstrate that the sub was called.
  -
  When done with the creation of the document, this `main()` sub is called.

  Generally, these examples need to be executed on the command line with
code {
P:\ath\to\example\dir> → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cscript_exe[script] create.wsf
code }

  For Excel, there are also these two additional examples: → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Excel/workbook_open[`workbook_open()`)] and
  → Microsoft/Office/VBScript-App-Creator/examples/Excel/add-module[add/replace modules].
