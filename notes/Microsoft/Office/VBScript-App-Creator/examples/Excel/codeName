$ Examples for VBScript MS-Office App Creator: change the codeName property of a worksheet

{ changeCodeName.vb

  The following function creates a new → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet and changes its `.codeName` property to `shXYZ`.

  It turned out that after creating a worksheet programmatically, its codename property cannot be easily changed because of some quirks with Excel.

  the issue.

}
{ func.vb 

  With the changed `codeName` property, the respective → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet can now be referenced by that name (here: `shXYZ`):
