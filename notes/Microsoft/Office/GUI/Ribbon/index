$ Office Ribbon

{ Expanding/collapsing the Ribbon

  The Ribbon can be expanded or collapsed by double clicking on a Menu/Tab name in the ribbon.

  With VBA, it is possible like so:
code {
→ Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/CommandBars/executeMso[application.commandBars.executeMso] "HideRibbon"
→ Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/CommandBars/executeMso[application.commandBars.executeMso] "MinimizeRibbon"
code }
  Note: in spite the names `HideRibbon` and `MinimizeRibbon`, these command in fact toggles between hidden and shown ribbons and/or menues.

}
