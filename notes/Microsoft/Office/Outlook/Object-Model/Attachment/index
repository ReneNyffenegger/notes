$ Outlook Object Model: Attachment

{ Methods and properties
  table { ll

    `application` ☰
    `blockLevel` ☰
    `class` ☰
    `delete()` ☰
    `displayName` ☰ Seems to correspond to the attachment's file name (but the documentation explicitly states that it does not need to be the actual file name).
    `fileName` ☰
    `getTemporaryFilePath()` ☰ Only valid for those attachments whose type property is `olAttachmentType.olByValue`, i.e. the attachment is a copy and that the copy can be accessed even if the original file is removed.
    `index` ☰
    `parent` ☰
    `pathName` ☰
    `position` ☰
    `propertyAccessor` ☰
    `saveAsFile()` ☰
    `session` ☰
    `size` ☰
    `type` ☰
