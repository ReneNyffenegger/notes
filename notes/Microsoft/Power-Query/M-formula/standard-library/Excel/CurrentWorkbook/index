$ Power Query M formula language standard library: Excel.CurrentWorkbook

`Excel.CurrentWorkbook()` returns a table with two columns: `Content` and `Name`.
-
The column `Name` lists the names of → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Range/index#excel-range-name[named ranges]
-
`Content` contains tables that themselves contain the values of the named ranges.

The following → development/languages/VBA example tries to demonstrate how it is possible to access the values of named ranges using `Excel.CurrentWorkbook()`.

{ Created worksheet

  When executed, the example produces the following → Microsoft/Office/Excel/Object-Model/Worksheet[worksheet].

  The left-most table shows the named range that is created by the VBA function `createNamedRange`.

  The second table is the result of just calling `Excel.CurrentWorkbook()`.

  The third table applies `{ [Name = "namedRange" ] }` on the result of `Excel.CurrentWorkbook()` to select the row whose `Name` is equal to `namedRange` (which happens to be the name of the named range).

  The last table simply uses the value `Content` which contains the same values as the original named range.
