   Is it possible to turn off the following message:
 "
    Do you approve running this native query? Your approval will also
    apply to any occurerences of the same native query in other documents.

    Native queries may be unsafe and alter the database. Because native queries may be
    rerun multiple times, those which do alter the database may result in incorret
    or unpredictable behavior.

    This native query uses parameters. The query will change based on the parameters'
    values, but you will not be asked to approve the query again…
