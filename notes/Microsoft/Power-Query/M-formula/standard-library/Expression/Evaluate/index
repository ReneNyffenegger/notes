{ Accessing global symbols such as the standard library #Expression-Evaluate-shared

  The → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/language/keywords/_shared[`#shared`] record comes in handy to pass the names of global symbols such as those of function names of the → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/standard-library to
  the expression to be evaluated.

  Without passing `#shared`, the following document would produce an *The name 'Number.Sin' doesn't exist in the current context* error.
