$ Power Query M formula language standard library: Diagnostics.Trace

`Diagnostics.Trace` allows to write directly, if tracing is enabled, to the *Power BI trace log* from a query.

code {
Diagnostics.Trace(
            traceLevel as number,
            message    as anynonnull,
            value      as any,
   optional delayed    as nullable logical
)
as any
code }


The following expression writes *Hello world* into the log and evaluates to 42.
code {
Diagnostics.Trace(
   TraceLevel.Information, 
  "Hello world", 
   () => 42, 
   true
)
code }

sa:
  Tracing can be enabled under → Microsoft/Power-Query/Editor/GUI/Ribbon/File/Options-and-Settings/Query-Options[File -> Options & Settings -> Query Options] -> Global -> Diagnostics. This dialog has also the
  link «Open crash dump/trace folder» which opens to the location where the trace log is written to.
