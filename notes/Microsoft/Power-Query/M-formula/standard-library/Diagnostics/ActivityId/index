$ Power Query M formula language standard library: Diagnostics.ActivityId

`Diagnostics.ActivityId()` returns a → development/UUID-GUID[UUID (or GUID)] that is unique for the currently-running evaluation. An expression that is evaluated
with → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/standard-library/Expression/Evaluate[`Expression.Evaluate()`] is considered to be executed in the same evaluation as its parent.
Thus, in the following example `guid`, `same_guid` and `evaluated_guid` all evaluate to the same value:
