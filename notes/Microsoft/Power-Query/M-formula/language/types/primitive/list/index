$ Power Query M formula language, primitive types: list
@ list

A *list* can be thought of an array of elements whose → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/language/types[types] can be different. These elements are denoted by curly braces `{ … }`.

When evaluated in → Microsoft/Office/Excel, for example with → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/evaluation/readFormulaFromFile[this VBA code], this formula evaluates to:

Note that Excel for a reason chooses to display the date type as number rather than formatted as date.

{ Sequences

  `..` generates a sequence of numbers:

  This produces:

{ Get n-th element from a list

  If `L` is a list, the expression `L{n}` gets the (zero based) n-th element from that list.

  The following example evaluates to `"two"`:

sa:

  A set of elements that is indexed by names rather than position is a → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/language/types/primitive/record.

  → Microsoft/Power-Query/M-formula/language/types/table[Tables] can be thought of list of lists (but with additional features).
