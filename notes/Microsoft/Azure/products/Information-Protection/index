{ Storing labels in Office Documents and eMails

  Office documents and (Outlook?) eMails store labels in metadata.

  → Microsoft/Office/Word, → Microsoft/Office/Excel and → Microsoft/Office/PowerPoint documents store this metadata in a *custom propert* with the name
 `MSIP_Label_<GUID>_Enabled` where `<GUID>` is the → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] of the label.

  In eMails, the labe is stored in a `x-header` field.

  An example that demonstrates how an Information Label can be set in → Microsoft/Office/Excel with → development/languages/VBA[Visual Basic for Applications] is → Microsoft/Office/Object-Model/DocumentProperties/set-Azure-Information-Protection-Label[here].
