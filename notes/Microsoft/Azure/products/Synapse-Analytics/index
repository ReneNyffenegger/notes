$ Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics was formerly known as *SQL Data Warehouse*.

The goal of Synapse Analytics is to bring together *Enterprise data warehousing* and *Big Data analytics*.

{ Components

  Components of Synapse Analytics are
  table { ll
  Synapse SQL ☰ → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL based analtics, available as *SQL pool* and *SQL on-demand*.
  Spark ☰ 
  Synapse Pipelines ☰
  Studio ☰
  table }

}
{ Data Warehouse Units (DWU)

  Data Warehouse Units are used to measure performance and consumption of resources and then calculate
  billing.

  The *service level* determines the available Data Warehouse Units that are available.

  Costs for storage and computing are determined separately.

  It's possible to select the current DWU numbers with SQL
code {
select
   db.name              db_name, -- [Database],
   ds.edition                  , -- [Edition] ,
   ds.service_objective        , -- [Service Objective]
from
   sys.database_service_objectives as ds join
   → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/databases[sys.databases]                   as db on ds.database_id = db.database_id
;
code }

}
{ Database Transaction Unit (DTU)

? A given DTU allows for a specific amount of DWU.

}
{ Synapse SQL Pool

? A *Synapse SQL Pool* is the entireity of the enterprise data warehousing features that are available with *Azure Synopse*.

  { Service objective
 
code {
create database dbFooBarBaz (
  edition           = 'Datawarehouse',
  SERVICE_OBJECTIVE = 'DW1000c'
)
code }

  }

{ Querying Synapse with Power BI

  It is possible to query Synapse with Power BI. However, Microsoft recommends to consider Power BI on top of
