$ Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse Analytics was formerly known as *SQL Data Warehouse*.

Two goals of Synapse Analytics are
  • to bring together *Enterprise data warehousing* and *Big Data analytics*.
  • centralize → development/Data in the → development/Cloud tobe accessed with standard → misc/ISO/9075[ANSI SQL] queries.

A key feature of Synapse is the ability to query both relational and non-relational → development/Data at Petabyte scale blazingly fast using → development/databases/SQL[SQL].

{ Components

  Components of Synapse Analytics are
  table { ll
  Synapse SQL ☰ → development/databases/SQL-Server/T-SQL based analytics, available as *SQL pool* and *SQL on-demand*.
  → development/Apache/Spark ☰ → development/Big-Data[Big Data]
  Synapse Pipelines ☰ → development/Enterprise/Integration/data[Data integration] and → development/Data/warehouse/ETL[ETL]/ELT
  Studio ☰ Unified experience for managing, monitoring, coding and security.
  table }

  Azure Synapse integrates well with other Azure services such as
    • Power BI
    • → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cosmos-DB[Cosmos DB]
    • → Microsoft/Azure/products/Machine-Learning[Azure ML]
    • → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Share

}
{ Data Warehouse Units (DWU)

  Data Warehouse Units are used to measure performance and consumption of resources and then calculate
  billing.

  The *service level* determines the available Data Warehouse Units.

  Costs for storage and computing are determined separately.

  It's possible to select the current DWU numbers with SQL
code {
select
   db.name              db_name, -- [Database],
   ds.edition                  , -- [Edition] ,
   ds.service_objective          -- [Service Objective]
from
   sys.database_service_objectives as ds join
   → development/databases/SQL-Server/administration/schemas/sys/objects/views/databases[sys.databases]                   as db on ds.database_id = db.database_id
;
code }

}
{ Database Transaction Unit (DTU)

? A given DTU allows for a specific amount of DWU.

}
{ Synapse SQL Pool

? A *Synapse SQL Pool* is the entirety of the enterprise data warehousing features that are available with *Azure Synopse*.

  { Service objective
 
code {
create database dbFooBarBaz (
  edition           = 'Datawarehouse',
  SERVICE_OBJECTIVE = 'DW1000c'
)
code }

  }

}
{ Querying Synapse with Power BI

  It is possible to query Synapse with Power BI. However, Microsoft recommends to consider Power BI on top of
  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Analysis-Services or Analysis Service IaaS.

}
{ Misc

  Apparently, → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint/primary-key and unique → development/databases/SQL/table/constraint[constraints] can only be created as *not enforced*.

}

sa:

  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Synapse-Analytics/SQL is a distributed query system

  Similar offerings for cloud → development/Data/warehouse[Data Warehouses] include
    • AWS Redshift
    • → Companies-Products/Google/Cloud-Platform[GCP] Big Query
    • Snowflake

  *Resource Providers* for Azure Power BI Embedded include
    • Microsoft.Sql
    • Microsoft.Synapse
