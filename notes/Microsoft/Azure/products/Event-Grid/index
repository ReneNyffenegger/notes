$ Azure Event Grid

*Get reliable event delivery at massive scale*

*Event Grid* implements the *Publisher-Subscriber* pattern.
-
? Events, triggered by «Event sources», are published to *Event grid topics* (Compare → development/Apache/Kafka). Subscribers of a particular event get subsequently notified of that event.
-
For example, → Microsoft/Azure/products/Blob-Storage[Blob Storage] might trigger an event each time new content is uploaded to Blob Storage.

Microsoft claims that 10 Million events per second can be routed per → Microsoft/Azure#azure-region[region] of which the first 100 thousand operations per month are free.
