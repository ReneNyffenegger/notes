$ Azure DevOps authentication

Authentication is required for applications that want to access → Microsoft/Azure/products/DevOps services, for example using a → development/web/service/REST service.

The Azure DevOps API doesn't support non-interactive service access via service principals.

→ Microsoft/Azure/products/DevOps/authentication/PAT[Personal Access Tokens (PATs)] allow to access Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS) without directly using a username and a
→ development/security/password.
