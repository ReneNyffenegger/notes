$ Azure DevOps: Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) allow to access → Microsoft/Azure/products/DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS) without directly using a username and a → development/security/password.

PATs have an expiration date.

→ development/version-control-systems/git/Windows/Git-Credential-Manager-Core is an optional tool that makes it easy to create PATs when working with → Microsoft/Azure/products/Repos.
