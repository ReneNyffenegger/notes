$ Azure DevOps

*Services for teams to share code, track work and ship software*

Azure DevOps provides services in the following areas:
  • planning work
  • collaboration on source code
  • building applications
  • deploying applications

{ DevOps in the Cloud and on-prem

  DevOps is available in the → development/Cloud (referred to as *Azure DevOps Services*) or on-prem (referred to as *Azure DevOps Server*).

  The on-prem offering requires an → development/databases/SQL-Server backend.

 *Azure DevOps Services* was previously called *Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)*. The former name of *Azure DevOps Server* was *Team Foundation Server (TFS)*.

*Azure DevOps Server Express* is a no-cost version of Azure DevOps Server for individual developers or teams of up to five members.
 -
 It can be installed on a personal deskop or laptop and does not need a dedicated server.

{ DevOps services
  
  The following table lists the DevOps services. With the renaming of VSTS, the «old» VSTS features are brought in line with DevOps naming:
  table { ll
     ~DevOps service~ ☰ ~VSTS feature~
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Boards ☰ Work
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Pipelines ☰ Build & Release
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Repos ☰ Code
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Test-Plans ☰ Test
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Artifacts ☰ Packages (extensions)
  table }

{ Enhancing DevOps

  The functionality of DevOps can be enhanced by integrating extensions that are offered by
    • Campfire
    • Slack
    • Trello
    • UserVoice
    • etc.

}
{ Projects

  Projects are a fundamental concept in Azure DevOps: they store data that is added to DevOps.

  A project provides a source code repository.

  A project is logical entity in which software building takes place and allows to perform the following related activities:
    • planning
    • tracking progress
    • collaboration

  A project is associated with at least one *team*, which is created automatically when the project is created.
  -
  Additional teams can be added to a project if needed (Typically, a team consists of 6 to 9 members).

  A project can be accessed from a → development/web/browser[browser] on the → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL] `https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}`

}
{ Collections

  A *collection* is a container for projects.

  When signing up with Azure DevOps Services or installing Azure DevOps server (formerly TFS), a default collection is created.

  In Azure DevOps Services, a collection corresponds to an organization.

}
{ Work items #az-devops-work-items

  A work item is one of
    • issue
    • bug
    • epic
    • feature
    • user story
    • task

  A work item collects
     • information (field values)
     • attachments
     • relations to other work items
