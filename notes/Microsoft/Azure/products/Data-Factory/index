$ Azure Data Factory

*Hybrid data integration at enterprise scale, made easy*

*Data Factory* supports processing on-prem → development/Data (for example from → development/databases/SQL-Server) with data
that originates in the → development/Cloud (for example → Microsoft/Azure/products/SQL-Database, Blobs and Tables) with highly-available and fault-tolerant *data pipelines*.

*Azure Data Factory* lets users create and schedule data-driven workflows and thus lets them focus on *transformative analytics*.

As part of the ETL scheduling process, Data Factory might also orchestrate other tools for processing data, such as → development/databases/SQL-Server/Integration-Services[SSIS].

sa:

  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Blob-Storage might be used as a landing zone for files that are then retrieved by Data Factory.
