$ Azure Blob Storage

Blob Storage aims at storing large amount of → development/Data#un_structured-data[unstructured] (text or graphics) or raw data.

Blob Storage is → development/web/service/REST[REST] based and can be accessed from anywhere in the world with → development/web/HTTPS.

Often, Blob Storage is used within an Azure framework as *staging area*.

{ Partioning Blob Storage

  Depending on the usage of the blobs, they can be partioned into
    • *block blobs*, to up/download large amount of → development/Data quickly, or
    • *page blobs*, if random access (as opposed to serial access in block blobs) is required.

}
{ Containers

  Each blob (block or page) is held in a container and given a unique name within that container.

  Typically, a container groups related blobs according to their security requirements.

}
{ Partition key

  The triple (account name, container name, blob name) is the *partition key* for a blob.

  The partition key is used to partition data into ranges which can then be load-balanced accross the system (but a single blob can only be served by a single server).

}

sa:

  Apparently, data in the Blob Storage can be queried from → development/databases/SQL-Server#mssql-polybase[polybase].

  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Lake-Storage is built on Azure Blob Storage.
  -
  → development/Data[Data] associated with → Microsoft/Azure/products/HDInsight[HDInsight] is stored in → Microsoft/Azure/products/Blob-Storage by default.

  Blob Storage might be used as a → development/Data provider for → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cognitive-Search.

  Blob Storage might be used as a landing zone for data that then can be retrieved from → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Factory for further processing in a data pipeline.
