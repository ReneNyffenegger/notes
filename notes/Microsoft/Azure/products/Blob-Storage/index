$ Azure Blob Storage

Blob Storage aims at storing large amount of → development/Data#un_structured-data[unstructured] (text or graphics) or raw data.

Blob Storage is → development/web/service/REST[REST] based and can be accessed from anywhere in the world with → development/web/HTTPS.

Often, Blob Storage is used within an Azure framework as *staging area*.

{ Types of blobs

  Depending on the usage of the blobs, they can be partioned into
    • *block blobs*, to up/download large amount of → development/Data quickly, or
    • *page blobs*, if random access (as opposed to serial access in block blobs) is required. A page blob contains data up to 8 TB.
    • *append blobs*, which are optizmized for appending (for example → development/log-files)

}
{ Containers

  Each blob (block or page) is held in a container and given a unique name within that container.

  A container name must be a valid DNS name that follows the following rules:
   • Name must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (`-`) character.
   • Every dash  character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
   • All letters in a container name must be lowercase.
   • Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

  Typically, a container groups related blobs according to their security requirements.

}
{ Partition key

  The triple (account name, container name, blob name) is the *partition key* for a blob.

  The partition key is used to partition data into ranges which can then be load-balanced across the system (but a single blob can only be served by a single server).

}
{ Copying blobs

  Copy → development/Data into or from blobs with
    • `AzCopy.exe` is a command line executable that copies blobs or files to or from a storage account. It can be downloaded from → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10[here].
    • → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Factory
    • *Blobfuse*: a virtual file system driver. 
    • → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Box
    • Azure Import/Export service

  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Storage

  Apparently, data in the Blob Storage can be queried from → development/databases/SQL-Server#mssql-polybase[polybase].

  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Lake-Storage is built on Azure Blob Storage.
  -
  → development/Data[Data] associated with → Microsoft/Azure/products/HDInsight[HDInsight] is stored in → Microsoft/Azure/products/Blob-Storage by default.

  Blob Storage might be used as a → development/Data provider for → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cognitive-Search.

  Blob Storage might be used as a landing zone for data that then can be retrieved from → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Factory for further processing in a data pipeline.

  Data in *Blob Storage* might be queried with → Microsoft/Azure/products/Data-Lake-Analytics#az-u-sql[U-SQL]
