$ Azure Cosmos DB

*Fast → development/databases/NoSQL database with open APIs for any scale*

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed multi-model → development/databases service.

{ Models

  Some supported models (APIs?) include
    • SQL-over-JSON (Database stores → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON documents which are queriable, however, with → development/databases/SQL])
    • Document (Queriable with the MongoDB-API, making migration from MongoDB solutions to Azure easy)
    • Column (via the Apache-Cassandra API)
    • Table (→ Microsoft/Azure/products/Table-Storage)
    • Graph (Gremlin)

  More models are apparently scheduled to come.

  The model must be chosen when a new resource is created.
