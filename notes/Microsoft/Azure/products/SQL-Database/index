*Managed, intelligent SQL in the → development/Cloud*.

*Azure SQL Database* is a product that belongs to the  → Microsoft/Azure/products/SQL product family.

{ Deployment options

  Azure SQL Database is deployed in one of two fundamental ways:
  table { ll
    Single Database ☰ The available resources for the database are not shared.
    Elasic Pool ☰ A set of resources is shared among the databases that participate in the elastic pool.
  table }

 *Elastic pools* are especially *cost-effective* if the participating have variable usager patterns that have consumption peaks at different times.

  In both cases, the resources are managed by → Microsoft/Azure/products/SQL/logical-SQL-server[logical SQL Server]


}
{ Evergreen

    • performance tuning
    • high availablity
    • disaster recovery
