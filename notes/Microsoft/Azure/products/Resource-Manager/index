$ Azure Resource Manager

*Simplify how you manage your app resources*

The *Resource Manager* processes all requests towards an Azure Service.
-
It first → development/security/authentication[authenticates] and authorizes this request and then passes the request to the according Azure Service which then fullfills the request.

The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) replaced the older *Azure Service Manager* (ASM). The main differences between ARM and ASM seem to be that ARM allows to manage resources in 
→ Microsoft/Azure/resource/group[resource groups] and that
ARM provides a (→ development/languages/JavaScript/objects/JSON[JSON]-based?) API for provisioning resources in Azure.
