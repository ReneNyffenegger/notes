$ Azure Table Storage

*→ development/databases/NoSQL key-value store using semi-structured datasets*

A *table* is a set of *entities*.

An *entity* is a set of up to 252 *custom properties* and 3 *system properties*.

A *property* is a name-value pair.
-
Apparently, the names of a property must not start with a digit and are case insensitive. Also, a name cannot contain spaces or dashes.
 
The *system properties* are
  • Partition key (which determines the partition into which the entity will be placed)
  • Row key (which is unique in a given partition)
  • Timestamp (whose value is set by the system and is then read-only)

  Azure Table Storage can also be used via the corresponding → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cosmos-DB model.

  The → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cosmos-DB Table API offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes.
