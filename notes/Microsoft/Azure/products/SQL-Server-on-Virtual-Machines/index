*SQL Server on Azure VMs* is a product that belongs to the  → Microsoft/Azure/products/SQL product family.

SQL Server on Azure VMs is an → development/Cloud/aaS/IaaS[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)] which allows its users to run an → development/databases/SQL-Server on a fully managed
virtual machine.

{ Migration of on-prem databases into the Cloud

 *SQL Server on Azure VMs* provides the exactly same functionality as an on-prem → development/databases/SQL-Server installation.

  Thus migrating («lift and shift») an on-prem database into the → development/Cloud is as easy (or painful) as moving the database
  from one on-prem server to another.

  With → Microsoft/Azure/products/SQL-Managed-Instance, a migration is also touted to be easy. But because there are some functional differences
  between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance, an application might need to be tweaked for the migration.
