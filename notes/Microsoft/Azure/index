{ Subscriptions #az-subscription

  A *subscription* is a service agreement with Microsoft that allows to create and run Azure resources, which are associated with a *tenant*

  The subscription holder manages Azure services. (Every Azure resource is associated with a subscription).

  A subscription belongs to a tenant.

? Incurred costs are billed on a subscription. (But it seems that they're paid by the account to which the subscription is attached).

? A subscription is identified by a → development/UUID-GUID[GUID]. The subscription name can be changed.

? A sbuscription is also related to a directory (which can also be changed - but requires mult-factor authentication).

? There seems to be a N:1 relationship between *subscriptions* and *Azure Active Directory tenants*.

? There seems to be a N:1 relationship between *resource groups* and *subscriptions*.

? There also seems to be a N:1 relationship between *resource providers* and *subscriptions* (resource providers can be used after registering the subscription for the resource provider).

  In (→ Windows/PowerShell) → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cloud-Shell[Cloud Shell], the directories in the
  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cloud-Shell#az-shell-azure-drive[`Azure:`] → Windows/PowerShell/language/provider/drive correspond to the
  available subscriptions.


  { Tags
  
    Tags are name/value pairs that allow to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups.

    Name length is up to 512 characters and case insensitive, value length is up to 256 characters and case senstitive).

    At times *key* is also referred to as *key*.

    There is a 50 *tags per resource* limit.

  }
  { Misc

    The PowerShell command `→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/azSubcription/get`.

    The shell command `az account list`

  }

}
{ Resources

  A *resource* is a manageable item that is available through Azure such as
    • Virtual machines
    • → #az-storage-account[storage accounts]
    • web apps
    • databases
    • virtual networks
    • etc…

  Multiple resources can be associated with a *resource group* to make their management easier.

  Resources can be created in
    • the → Microsoft/Azure/products/Portal[portal]
    • …
    • …


  { Resource Group

    A *resource group* is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and in which they can be managed.

  }
  { Resource Provider #az-resource-provider

    A *resource provider* is a set of defined REST services that allow to enable the functionality for a given Azure service (or also resource?).
    -
    For example, before → Microsoft/Azure/products/Cloud-Shell can be used, the *Microsoft.CloudShell* resource provider must te registered.
    
    A resource provider can be → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers[mapped to Azure services].

    Before a resource provider can be used, the *subscription* must be registered for the resource provider (which requires permission to the resource provider's `/register/action` operation.

    A list of resource providers including the information which ones are registered is found in the → Microsoft/Azure/products/Portal[portal] under

    Of course, with → Windows/PowerShell, it is much easier with
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/az/ResourceProvider/get[get-azResourceProvider] | → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/select[select-object] providerNamespace, registrationState
code }

    The following resource providers are registered by default:
      • Microsoft.ADHybridHealthService
      • Microsoft.Authorization
      • Microsoft.Billing
      • Microsoft.ClassicSubscription
      • Microsoft.Commerce
      • Microsoft.Consumption
      • Microsoft.CostManagement
      • Microsoft.Features
      • Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering
      • Microsoft.Portal
      • Microsoft.ResourceGraph
      • Microsoft.Resources
      • Microsoft.SerialConsole
      • microsoft.support

  }
  { Resource types

    The ~format of a name~ of a resource type is *{resource provider}/{resource type}*.

    For example, the `Microsoft.KeyVault` resource provider offers a *resource type* `vaults`, thus , the *resource type* for a key vault is `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults`.

    A resource provider comes with a versioned API. The available APIS can be be determined like so:
code {
((get-azResourceProvider -providerNamespace Microsoft.BluePrint).resourceTypes | where-object resourceTypeName -eq blueprints).apiVersions
code }

    Not all resource types are supported in all locations. The following query determines the locations for a given resource type:
code {
((get-azResourceProvider -providerNamespace Microsoft.SQL).resourceTypes | where-object resourceTypeName -eq locations/serverTrustGroups).locations
code }

  }
  { Resource Manager Template

    A *Resource Manager Template* is a → development/languages/JavaScript/JSON file that defines a set of resources which are deployed to a resource group, subscription, management group or tenant.

  }
  { Storage account #az-storage-account

    All data stored in Azure is assigned to a *storage account*.

    The storage account enables external acess to data outsize of Azure through  → development/web/HTTPS (and HTTP?) by assigning
    a unique URL to every object stored in a storage account.

  }
  { Bicep files

    Bicep files specify what needs to deployed. They're written in a declaritive syntax where the desired outcome is described, not the sequence how to achieve it.

  }

}
{ Command Line Interface (cLI)

  Azure can be managed from the *command line*:

code {
C:\> az vm create
code }

  { PowerShell

    Sign into an Azure subscription:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/azAccount/connect[connect-azAccount]
code }

    List subscriptions
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/azSubcription/get[get-azSubcription]
code }

    Use a non-default subscription:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/azContext/set[set-azContext] -subscriptionName tq84
code }
 
  }

}
{ Tenant

  A *tenant* is a representation of an organization and sometimes also referred as «organization» in documentation or when working with
  → Microsoft/Azure/products/Active-Directory[Active Directory]

? An instance of an *Azure AD* is issued to an organization or application developer when the organization or developer start a relationship with Microsoft.

}
{ Storage

  table { ll
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/File-Storage[File Storage] ☰ Storage for legacy applications using the standard → development/misc/SMB[Server Message Block (SMB)] protocol
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Blob-Storage[Blob Storage] ☰ Hierarchical, container-based store for any data, stored in named blobs. 
    → Microsoft/Azure/products/Table-Storage[Table Storage] ☰ → development/databases/NoSQL Key/value store
    Queue Storage ☰ Messaging for workflow processing and for communcation between → development/Cloud components
  table }

  { Geo-redundant Storage (GRS)

    GRS aims at protecting storage data from serious data center disasters. This is hoped to be achieved by replicating blobs, tables, queues and VM disks from one data center to a paired data center within
    a geographic region. 

    GRS is included in the current pricing for Storage. It's possible to opt-out from GRS for LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) which results in a discounted price.

{ Global Infrastructure

  { Geography

    A Geography consists of multiple (always?) regions

  }

  { Region / location #azure-region

    A *region* is a set of at least two *data centers*.

    A region is paired with another region (for example West Europe and North Europe).

?   A region has one *location* which is typically named after a city (for example region *West Europe* has location *Amsterdam*).

    Resilience is guaranteed by having at least three physically separated *availability zones* in an (enabled) region.

    See also the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/az/Location/get[`get-azLocation` PowerShell cmdLet]

  }
  { Availability Zones

    An *availability zone* is a unique physical location within a region.

    An availability zone has one or more *data centers* which protects applications and → development/Data from
    from datacenter failures. 

    Azure offers 99.99% VM update SLA with availabiltiy zone.

    Note: there is also the expression «zone» which refers to a group of *regions* and is used for billing purposes (such as for example data transfer pricing which depends on the zone).

  }
  { Data center

    A *data center* is equipped with independent
      • power
      • cooling
      • networking

  }

}
{ Pricing

  Typically, a service is priced based on usage of
    • units of size
    • amount of data
    • number of operations

  When an Azure resource is provisioned, Azure creates a *metered instance* for that service. These meters track the resources' usage and generate a usage record which is the basis
  for the calculation of the bill.

}
{ TODO

  { Virtual Machines

    A *virtual machine* seems to require an existing *resource group*.

    When a VM is created, two disks are attached to the VM:
      • An *Operating System* disk (with default letter `C:`) and
      • a *temporary* disk (with default letter `D:`).

  }
  { Microsoft Authenticator App

    → https://aka.ms/authapp[aka.ms/authapp] is supposed to make 2FA with Azure easier.

  }
  { Environment variables

code {
$ echo $AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN_FILE
$ echo $AZURE_HTTP_USER_AGENT
$ echo $AZUREPS_HOST_ENVIRONMENT
code }

  }
