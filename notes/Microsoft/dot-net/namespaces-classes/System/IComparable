$ System.IComparable (Interface)

The `System.IComparable` interface is required for objects to be able to be sorted or ordered.

`IComparable` specifies one method `public int CompareTo (object obj);`
-
A return value of less than zero indicates that `this` instances is to be sorted after `obj`. If the return value is greater than zero, it indicates that
`this` instance is to be sorted *after* `obj` and `0` indicates that both instances have the same position.
