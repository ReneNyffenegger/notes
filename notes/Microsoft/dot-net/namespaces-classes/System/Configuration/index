$ System.Configuration (namespace)

The classes in the `System.Configuration` namespace can be used by managed code to read settings from configuration files such as the â†’ Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/Config/machine_config[`machine.config`] file.
-
However, these classes don't permit updating (writing to) such files.
