$ System.Version (class)

`System.Version` consists of 4 non-negative int-32 values, `Major`, `Minor`, `Build` and `Revision` of which the first two are mandatory and the last two optional.

The high 16 bits of the value of `Revision` are accessible through the property `MajorRevision`, the lower 16 bits through `MinorRevision`.
