@ System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate

`System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate` provides helpers for using X.509 v.3 certificates - However, the only format supported by this class is *ASN.1 DER* and `System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2` should
be used instead.
