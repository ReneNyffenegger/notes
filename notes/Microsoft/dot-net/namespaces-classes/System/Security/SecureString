On → Windows, → https://github.com/dotnet/platform-compat/blob/master/docs/DE0001.md[this functionality is not supported by the OS]. Therefore, it is recommended to not use `SecureString` when porting code to
→ Microsoft/dot-net.

The → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring[.NET documentation] has the following important note:
"
  A SecureString object should never be constructed from a String, because the
  sensitive data is already subject to the memory persistence consequences of
  the immutable String class. The best way to construct a SecureString object
  is from a character-at-a-time unmanaged source, such as the Console.ReadKey
  method.
