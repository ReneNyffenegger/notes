$ System.Attribute (class)
@ System.Attribute

Base class for custom attribute-classes.

Attributes are a feature of the → Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime[Common Language Runtime] which allow to annotate types, fields, methods and properties with keyword/value pairs in order to describe the program.
For example, attributes allow to describe a method with more fine details than the crude `public` or `private` specifiers. The values of the attributes can be extracted using *reflection*.

These attributes are stored in the metadata of a .NET Framework file.

Each attribute class has positional and named parameters.
-
The set of positional attributes is defined by the sequence of the parameters of the attribute classes's puublic constructor(s).
-
The set of named attributes is defined by the class's non-static, public and read-write fields or properties.

An attribute can be applied to different language-elements (such as methods or fields etc.). The attribute → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/AttributeTargets[`System.AttributeTargets`] is used to
specify which attribute can be applied to which element.


sa:

  Obsolete program elements can be marked as such with → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/ObsoleteAttribute[`System.ObsoleteAttribute`].

  How an attribute might be used can be controlled with the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/AttributeUsageAttribute[`System.AttributeUsageAttribute`] class

  A → Windows/PowerShell/language/function[PowerShell function] that is defined with the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/CmdletBindingAttribute[`System.Management.Automation.CmdletBindingAttribute`] attribute
  uses → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[PowerShell cmdLet] rather than script parameter binding.
