$ System.Management.Automation.PSObject (class)

{ Difference to System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject

  Jason Shirk provided a → https://stackoverflow.com/a/35965784/180275[helpful answer on StackOverflow] regarding the difference between a `PSObject` and a `PSCustomObject`. I believe the gist of his answer is the following:

  The `System..Management.Automation.PSObject` object wraps *other* objects. It is mostly used in → Windows/PowerShell to have a consistent object for different underlying object types
  ( → Microsoft/dot-net, → Windows/Management-Instrumentation[WMI], → Windows/development/COM[COM], ADSI, *property bags* etc…)

  If the wrapped object is a property bag, the property bag is stored in a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSCustomObject[`System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject`] object.

}

sa:
  → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/psObject


  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/type/accelerators[PowerShell type accelerator] for `System.Management.Automation.PSObject` is `[pscustomobject]` and `[psobject]`.
