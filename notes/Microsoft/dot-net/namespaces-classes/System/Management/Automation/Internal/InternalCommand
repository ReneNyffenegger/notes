$ System.Management.Automation.Internal.InternalCommand (abstract class)


The → https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandBase.cs[source code for `System.Management.Automation.Internal.InternalCommand`] has the following
note:
"
  Ideally this would be an internal class, but → development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] does not support
  public classes deriving from internal classes.
"

As per another comment in the source code, it seems that `InternalCommand` is used as base class *only* for
→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSCmdlet[`System.Management.Automation.PsCmdLet`].
