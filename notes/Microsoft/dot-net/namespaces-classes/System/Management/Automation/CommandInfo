$ System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo (class)

A `System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo` object provides information about a → Windows/PowerShell/language/command[PowerShell command].
In → Windows/PowerShell, an instance or an array of instances of `CommandInfo` can be obtained with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/get[`get-command` cmdLet].

After obtaining a `CommandInfo` object, it can be passed to the constructor of
→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/CommandMetadata[`System.Management.Automation.CommandMetadata`] which creates another object that then can be used
to query meta information about a command.

This technique is rudimentarily covered → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/command/get#get-command-query-meta-info[here].
