$ System.Management.Automation.PathInfo (class)

A `System.Management.Automation.PathInfo` object represents a *path* (such as a → Windows/file-system[file system] path or a → Windows/registry/tree-structure/key[registry key] name).

A `PathInfo` object is returned in → Windows/PowerShell by → Windows/PowerShell/language/cmdlet[cmdLets] such as → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/location/get[`get-location`],
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/path/resolve[`resolve-path`] or the automatic variable → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[`$pwd`].

Sometimes (I have not figured out when exactly), the `ToString()` method of `PathInfo` prepends the path with some → Windows/PowerShell/language/provider[provider] related information
(for example `Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::`) which can be, frankly, quite a nuisance.
-
In order to get rid of this prefix, the `providerPath` property must be used:
code {
"Current directory is: → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[$pwd]"
#
# Current directory is: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::P:\ath\to\directory

"Current directory is: $($pwd.providerPath)"
#
# Current directory is: P:\ath\to\directory
code }
