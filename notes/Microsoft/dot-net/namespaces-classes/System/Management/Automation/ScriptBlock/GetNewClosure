@ System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock - GetNewClosure()

{ Simple Example

code {
$var = 'initial value for variable var'
$sb = {
   write-host "Script block is invoked"
   write-host "  var = $var"
   if (test-path variable:xyz) {
       write-host "  The variable xyz is defined, it's value is $xyz"
   }
   else {
       write-host "  The variable xyz is not defined"
   }
}

$sb_closure = $sb.GetNewClosure()


$var = 'changed value for variable var'
$xyz = 'Value for xyz'

& $sb
& $sb_closure
code }

    If this code is placed into a script and executed, it prints:
code {
Script block is invoked
  var = changed value for variable var
  The variable xyz is defined, it's value is Value for xyz
Script block is invoked
  var = initial value for variable var
  The variable xyz is not defined
code }

}
