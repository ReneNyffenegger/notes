{ The .NET property types Property, Method and Events

  In most cases, a PowerShell object (which is an instance of → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Management/Automation/PSObject[`System.Management.Automation.PSObject`]) wraps
  a → Microsoft/dot-net object. The members of the underlying .NET object have one of the object types `Method`, `Property` or `Event`. These are marked with a ✓ in the last column of the first table.

  Members with another member type are added to the PowerShell object and are independent from the underlying .NET object.
  -
  Such members can be added with the → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/member/add[`add-member`] cmdLet. (See especially the
  → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/member/add#add-member-memberType[`-memberType`] option of that cmdLet).
