$ System.Management (namespace)

Microsoft prefers the `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure` namespace over `System.Management`:
"
  System.Management was the original .NET namespace used to access WMI; however, the APIs in this namespace generally are slower and do not scale as well relative to their more modern
  Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure counterparts.
