$ System.DBNull (class)

`System.DBNull` rerpresents a non-existing value.

The concept of non-existing values is most probably borrowed from → development/databases/SQL[SQL's] special → development/databases/SQL/data-types/null[null value/data type].

`DBNull` is a singleton.

`DBNull` and `null` are not the same thing.

  Compare with the → development/languages/VBA/language/null-and-nothing-etc#vba-nothing[VBA `null` value].
