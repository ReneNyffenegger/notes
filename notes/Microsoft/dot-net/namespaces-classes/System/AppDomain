$ System.AppDomain (class)

`System.AppDomain` represents an *application domain*, that is an an isolated environment where applications execute.

`System.AppDomain` derives from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/MarshalByRefObject[`System.MarshalByRefObject`]

An *application domain* is typically created by a *runtime host*.

An instance of `AppDomain` is able to respond to the following events
  • an → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly is loaded
  • an application domain will be unloaded
  • an unhandled exception is thrown.

Apparently, on → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/differences[.NET Core], there is exactly *one* `AppDomain` (whatever that means).

For each new AppDomain, a default → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Runtime/Remoting/Messaging/CallContext[`System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.CallContext`] is created.
