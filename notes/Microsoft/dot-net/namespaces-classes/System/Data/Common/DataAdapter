$ System.Data.Common.DataAdapter (class)

`System.Data.Common.DataAdapter` connects a → development/Data source with an *in-memory* → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Data/DataSet[`System.Data.DataSet`].

A `DataAdapter` is able to recognize changes that were made to → development/Data in the `DataSet` and to synchonize them with the original data source.

The `DataAdapter` uses an object that derived from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Data/Common/DbConnection[`System.Data.Common.DbConnection`] to read data from and write data back to the data source.
