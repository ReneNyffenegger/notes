$ ADO.NET: context connections

At least connections to → development/databases/SQL-Server (→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Data/SqlClient/SqlConnection[`System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection`]) and
→ development/databases/Oracle (→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleConnection[`Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleConnection`]) can be established as so-called
*context connections*.
-
Such context connections are useful if the (→ Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime[CLR]-) method needs to connect to the same database that the method was alread called from, for example because the method was called
in a stored procedure or was used in view or select statement.

In that case, a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Data/Common/DbConnection[`System.Data.Common.DbConnection`] can be established with the
→ development/databases/OLE-DB/connection-string[connection string] `context connection=true`.
