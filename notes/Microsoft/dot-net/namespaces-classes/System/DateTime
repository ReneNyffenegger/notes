$ System.DateTime (struct)

An instance of the `System.DateTime` represents a point in time between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31 with an accuracy of 100 nanoseconds without reference to a time zone.

Each of these possible point in times is assigned a number, called *tick*, which represents the number of 100-nonosecond intervals between Midnight January 1, 0001 and the point in time the instance of the struct
represents.

In → Windows/PowerShell, the current date-time is returned by the
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/date/get[`get-date` cmdLet].

{ String-formatting a DateTime

  The `ToString()` method takes a format string that allows to format the value of a  `DateTime` object.

 `System.DateTimeOffset`, → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/TimeSpan[`System.TimeSpan`], `System.TimeZoneInfo`, `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch`

  The → Windows/PowerShell/language/object/type/accelerators[PowerShell type accelerator] for `System.Datetime` is `[datetime]`.
