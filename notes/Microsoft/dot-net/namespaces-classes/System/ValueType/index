$ System.ValueType (class)

`System.ValueType` is the base class for all *value types* (as opposed to *reference types*).

When a variable with a value type is assigned to another variable, the content of the variable is copied (not a reference). Thus, unlike with reference types, after the assignment, the two variables
refer to two independent copies of the struct and can be separatly modified without influencing the other variable.

This behaviour plays a certain role when storing value types in *collections*.

A specific kind of value type is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Enum[`System.Enum`] (which itself allows to be derived from).

{ C-Sharp: structs

  It is not possible to create a type that *explicitely* inherits from `System.ValueType`.

  However, for example in C#, a → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/keywords/built-in-types/struct[`struct`] always implicitely derives from `System.ValueType`.
  This is demonstrated in the following example. (It also shows that structs need not
  be created with the → development/languages/C-Sharp/language/operators/new[`new` operator].
