{ Getting the library in versions prior to .NET Core 3.0

  → https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/overview#how-to-get-the-library[This link] indicates
  that `System.Text.Json` is by default only available as part of the shared framework for .NET Core 3.0 and later versions.

  Therefore, in earlier versions, `System.Text.Json` needs to be installed with NuGet (see → https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json[this link]).
