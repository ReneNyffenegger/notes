$ System.IClonable (interface)

The `System.IClonable` interface defines one method only which creates a new object that is the copy of the object that `Clone()` was called on.
-
The returned type must be the same type or compatible with the type of the object that `Clone()` was called on.
code {
public object Clone();
code }

The implementor of `Clone()` is free to perform a shallow copy or a deep copy. Therfore, Microsoft recommends that `IClonable` not be used in public APIs.

sa:
  â†’ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object#Object-MemberwiseClone[`Object.MemberwiseClone()`] creates a shallow copy of an object.
