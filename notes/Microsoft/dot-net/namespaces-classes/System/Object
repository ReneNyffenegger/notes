$ System.Object (class)

The class from which every other class in the CLR system derives, either directly or indirectly.

{ GetType()

  Every object/instance has a type. The method `GetType()` returns a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Type[`System.Type`] object that can be used to query information about
  that type (reflection).

}
{ Equals() and GetHashCode()

  The method `Equals(Object otherObj)` is supposed to return `true` if `otherObj` is (semantically?) equal to `this` object.

  For any two objects that are equal, their `GetHashCode()` method must return the same value.
  -
  The opposite is not true, however, two different object might also return the same value for `GetHashCode()`.

  The value of `GetHashCode()` is used in conjunction with inserting and locating objects into hash-based collection types such as
    • → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/Generic/Dictionary-TKey-TValue[`System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`]
    • → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/Hashtable[`System.Collections.Hashtable`]
    • classes that derive from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/DictionaryBase[`System.Collections.DictionaryBase`]

}
{ Overriding Equals() or GetHashCode()

  If one the methods `Equals()` or `GetHashCode()` is overridden, the othermethod must also be overridden, otherwise, a warning such as the following is thrown by a (C#?) compiler:
  "
   Warning as Error: '…' overrides Object.Equals(object o) but does not override Object.GetHashCode()
  "

}
