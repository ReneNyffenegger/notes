$ System.Object (class)

The class from which every other class in the CLR system derives, either directly or indirectly.

{ GetType()

  Every object/instance has a type. The method `GetType()` returns a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Type[`System.Type`] object that can be used to query information about
  that type (reflection).

}
{ ToString() #Object-ToString

 `ToString()` provides a basic implmentation to create a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/String[string] representation of an object.
  -
  If not overridden, `ToString()` returns the fully qualified type name of the object (which is demonstrated with → Windows/PowerShell/language/class/ToString[this PowerShell example]).

  In order to define a custom representation of a (derived) object, `ToString()` can be overridden.

  See also → Microsoft/dot-net/formatting-parsing#formatting-parsing-ToString[formatting and parsing] and
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Convert/ToString[`System.Convert.ToString()`].

}
{ Equals(otherObj) and GetHashCode() #Equals-GetHashCode

  The method `Equals(Object otherObj)` is supposed to return `true` if `otherObj` is (semantically?) equal to `this` object.

  For any two objects that are equal, their `GetHashCode()` method must return the same value.
  -
  The opposite is not true, however, two different object might also return the same value for `GetHashCode()`.

  The value of `GetHashCode()` is used in conjunction with inserting and locating objects into hash-based collection types such as
    • → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/Generic/Dictionary-TKey-TValue[`System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`]
    • → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/Hashtable[`System.Collections.Hashtable`]
    • classes that derive from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/DictionaryBase[`System.Collections.DictionaryBase`]

  See also → Windows/PowerShell/language/operator/comparison#comparison-required[this PowerShell example] that demonstrates how a → Windows/PowerShell/language/class[PowerShell class] implements
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IComparable[`System.IComparable`] and overrides `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()`.

}
{ MemberwiseClone() #Object-MemberwiseClone


code {
protected object MemberwiseClone ();
code }

 `MemberwiseClone()` creates a shallow copy of the current object.

  Compare with the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IClonable[`System.IClonable`] interface.

}
{ Overriding Equals() or GetHashCode()

  If one the methods `Equals()` or `GetHashCode()` is overridden, the othermethod must also be overridden, otherwise, a warning such as the following is thrown by a (C#?) compiler:
  "
   Warning as Error: '…' overrides Object.Equals(object o) but does not override Object.GetHashCode()
  "

}
