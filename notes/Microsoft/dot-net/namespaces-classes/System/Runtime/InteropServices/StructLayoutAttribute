$ System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute (class)

`System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute` is used to specify the layout of unmanaged data in memory. This layout is either sequential
(members of the struct are laid out in order they appear) or explicit (each member must specify offset using `FieldOffsetAttribute`).
