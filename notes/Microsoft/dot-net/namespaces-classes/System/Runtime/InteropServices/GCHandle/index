`System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle` provides a way to access a → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code[managed] objects from unmanaged memory.

table { ll
  `IsAllocated` ☰ `true` or `false`, indicating if the object is allocated. Used in combination with *weak* handles.
  `Target` ☰ The → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object[`System.Object`] that the handle represents.
  `AddrOfPinnedObject()` ☰ Returns a → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IntPtr[`System.IntPtr`] to the object data. The returned pointer is *stable* because `AddrOfPinnedObject()` prevents the garbage collector from moving around the object. For *strings*, the method returns the address of the first character, for *arrays* the address of the first element.
  `Alloc()` ☰ Prevent the managed object from being collected by the → Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime/garbage-collector.
  `Equals()` ☰
  `Free()` ☰
  `FromIntPtr` ☰ Get a `GCHandle` from an `IntPtr` handle to a managed object.
  `GetHashCode` ☰
  `ToIntPtr` ☰
