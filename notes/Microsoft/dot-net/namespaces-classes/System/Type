$ System.Type (abstract base class)

`System.Type` is the root class for reflection in → Microsoft/dot-net and represents one of the following concepts
  • class
  • value type
  • array
  • interface
  • enumeration
  • delegate
  • constructed generic type and generic type definition
  • type arguments / parameters of such constructed generic types 

Because types are fundamental in → Microsoft/dot-net and each (managed) object (instance) has a type, → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Object[`System.Object`] provides the method `GetType()` that returns a
`System.Type` that represents the type of the instance that `GetType()` was called on.

  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/RuntimeType[`System.RuntimeType`]
