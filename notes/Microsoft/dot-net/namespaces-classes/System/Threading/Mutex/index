$ System.Threading.Mutex

{ Powershell 7 example

  In a Powershell 7 session, we create a mutex:
code {
PS C:\> [bool] $newMutex = $false
PS C:\> $mutex = new-object System.Threading.Mutex($true, 'mtxTQ84', [ref] $newMutex)
PS C:\> $newMutex
True
code }
  
  In another Powershell 7 session, we create a mutex with the same name.
  -
  After creating the mutex, the value of `$newMutex` is `False` and indicates that the name was already known:
code {
PS C:\> [bool] $newMutex = $false
PS C:\> $mutex = new-object System.Threading.Mutex($true, 'mtxTQ84', [ref] $newMutex)
PS C:\> $newMutex
False
code }

  In the second session, we wait until the first session releases the mutex:
code {
PS C:\> $mutex.WaitOne()
code }

  We then release the mutex in the first session. Note how the blocked second session becomes unblocked:
code {
PS C:\> $mutex.ReleaseMutex()
code }

  We now wait in the first session until the second session releases the mutex ‥
code {
PS C:\> $mutex.WaitOne()
code }

  ‥ and release the mutex in the first session:
code {
PS C:\> $mutex.ReleaseMutex()
code }


}
