$ System.Threading.Tasks.Task (class)

A `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` object represents an asynchronous operation.

Such `Task` objects are central to the *Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)*.

The `Main()` entry point can, starting with â†’ development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] 7.1, return a `Task` or a `Task<int>`.
