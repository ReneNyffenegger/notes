$ System.IO.StreamWriter (class)

`System.IO.StreamWriter` derives from the (abstract) class → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IO/TextWriter[`System.IO.TextWriter`].

{ Constructor

  The constructor does not remove a file, rather, text written using the StreamWriter class is appended to the specified file (but see also the
  example below).

}
{ Write different encodings #dotNet-StreamWriter-encodings

  The following simple → Windows/PowerShell script tries to demonstrate how a file in different → development/Unicode/character-encoding[encodings]:
  → development/Unicode/UTF-8 with a → development/Unicode/BOM, UTF-8 without a BOM and Latin 1.

  Note that the script is encoded in Latin-1, so that its encoding is correctly determined in both, PowerShell 5.1 and 7.1 (see → Windows/PowerShell/encoding#ps-encoding-script[encoding of PowerShell scripts]). But this
  encoding causes this web page to render the `ä` of `'Bär'` with a question mark.

}
{ Appending text to a file

  Some constructurs of `StreamWriter` allow to set the second paramter to `true` so that text is appended to the file when re-opening it:
