$ System.IO.Directory - GetCurrentDirectory

The static method `GetCurrentDirectory()` returns the *current directory* as a string.

Note, in → Windows/PowerShell, the value of `GetCurrentDirectory()` is not necessarily the same as that
of → Windows/PowerShell/language/variable/automatic/pwd[`$pwd`].
