$ System.IO.Stream (abstract class)

`System.IO.Stream` is an abstract base class for all streams. A stream represents a sequence of → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Byte[bytes].

{ Fundamental operations on streams

  The two fundumental operations on streams are:
    • Reading → development/Data from a stream (usually into a `→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Byte[Byte][]`)
    • Writing Data into a stream (usually from a `Byte[]`)

  Some streams have a third fundamental operation: moving to a specific location within the stream. A typical example for such a stream is a file. An example, where
  moving to a specific position doesn't make lot of sense is a TCP/IP connection.

  In order to find out which operations are possible, a stream provides the following three methods:
    • `CanRead()`
    • `CanWrite()`
    • `CanSeek()`

}

  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Xml/XmlWriter#dotnet-XmlWriter-stream[This example] uses a stream to write an
  → development/XML[XML] document.
