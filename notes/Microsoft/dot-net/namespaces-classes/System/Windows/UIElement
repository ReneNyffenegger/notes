$ System.Windows.UIElement (class)

`System.Windows.UIElement` derives from → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Windows/Media/Visual[`System.Windows.Media.Visual`].
-
It defines core subsystems including
  • Layout,
  • Input, and
  • Events.

{ Layouting with Measure() and Arrange()

  With the `Measure()` method, a component announces the desired size it wishes to occupy.
  -
  This method might be called repeadetly until the layouter(?) was able to determine the ideal
  size for each component.

  After each size is determined, the layouter calls `Arrange()` to position an element.
