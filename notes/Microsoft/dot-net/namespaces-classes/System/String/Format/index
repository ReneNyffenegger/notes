$ .NET: String.Format

{ Aligning numbers on their decimal point

  In order to align numbers on their decimal point with `String.Format`, something like `{p,w:Fa}` can be chosen:
     • `p` indicates which value is formatted
     • `w` specifies the total width, including decimal point and optional sign
     • `F` is the literal letter `F` that specifies that the numbers are to be aligned on their decimal point.
     • `a` is the number of digits afther the decimal point.

  In the following example, the format specification is `{1,8:F3}`.
