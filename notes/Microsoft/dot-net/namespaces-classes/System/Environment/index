$ System.Environment (class)

`System.Environment` allows to query information about the current environment (such as → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variables]) and platform and manipulate these.

sa:

  The value of the property `Environment.SystemDirectory` is the name of the fully qualified *system directory*, for example → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32[`C:\Windows\System32`].

  The property `NewLine` stores the value for a → development/line-break[new line] (`"\n"` or `"\r\n"`).

  An example on how to iterate over the set of environment variables that is returned by `GetEnvironmentVariables()` is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/IDictionary#iterate-IDictionary[here].
