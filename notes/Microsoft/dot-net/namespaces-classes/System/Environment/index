$ System.Environment (class)

`System.Environment` allows to query information about the current environment (such as → Windows/development/environment-variables[environment variables]) and platform and manipulate these.

  An example on how to iterate over the set of environment variables that is returned by `GetEnvironmentVariables()` is → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Collections/IDictionary#iterate-IDictionary[here].
