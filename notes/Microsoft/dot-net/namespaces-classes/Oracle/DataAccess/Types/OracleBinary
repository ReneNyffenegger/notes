$ Oracle.DataAccess.Types.OracleBinary (class)

`Oracle.DataAccess.Types.OracleBinary` allows to access → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[(long) raw] data.

{ Writing long raw data to file

  The following example tries to demonstrate how → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[long raw] data can be extracted from a table and then be written to a file.

  It turned out that setting the  value → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand#OracleCommand-InitialLONGFetchSize[`InitialLONGFetchSize`] (in an 
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Oracle/DataAccess/Client/OracleCommand[`Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleCommand` object] to `-1` was immensely valuable for this example because it allowed me
  to access the *entire length* of the underlying long raw, even if it was larger than 32 KB!
