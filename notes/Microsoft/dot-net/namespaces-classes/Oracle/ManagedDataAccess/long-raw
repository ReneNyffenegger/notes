$ Example: read and write LONG RAW with Oracle managed driver

This is a demonstration how a → development/databases/Oracle/SQL/data-types/raw[`long raw`] can be written (`insert`) and read (`select`) from/to a table with the  → development/databases/Oracle/ODP_NET/drivers/managed[ODP.NET managed driver].

The example consists of two → development/languages/C-Sharp[C#] files: `insert-from-file.cs` and `select-to-file.cs`.

`insert-from-file.cs` reads the content of a binary file and inserts it into the table. The name of the binary file is hard coded to → https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snake_River_(5mb).jpg[`Snake_River_(5mb).jpg`]. I have chosen this
file because I wanted a file that is larger than 4 Mega Bytes.

`write-to-file.cs` reads the content of the written `long raw` and writes it into the file `extracted.bin`. Again, this name is hard coded.

{ Creating the table

  In order to run the example, a table is needed.
