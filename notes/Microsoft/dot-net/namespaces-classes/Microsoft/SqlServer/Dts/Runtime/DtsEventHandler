$ Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsEventHandler (sealed class)
@ Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsEventHandler

`Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.DtsEventHandler` inherits from `→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Microsoft/SqlServer/Dts/Runtime/DtsContainer` and is the
container that is executed when an event fires on its parent objects, thus, this is the class through which the run-time engine provides an event handling and notification system.

`DtsEventHandler` is somewhat special in that it is the only container class that does not (also) inherit from `→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Microsoft/SqlServer/Dts/Runtime/EventsProvider`.
