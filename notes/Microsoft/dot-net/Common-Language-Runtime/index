$ .NET: Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The *Common Language Runtime* is the heart of the → Microsoft/dot-net Framework.

The CLR is a *virtual machine* that provides *execution environment* for all .NET Framework code. The services of the CLR include
   • Memory management (allocation, → Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime/garbage-collector, …)
   • Type safety
   • Exception handling
   • Security (CAS: Code Access Security, CV: Code verification)
   • Thread management

Programs that run in the CLR is → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code.

Managed code, when started, receives a set of *permissions* from the host.

{ CLR versions

  The CLR is not necessarily updated when the → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework advances to another version. The following table shows some versions and CLR filenames:
  table { lll

    .NET Framework version ☰ CLR version ☰ CLR filename
    1.1. ☰ 1.1 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    2.0. ☰ 2.0 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    3.0. ☰ 2.0 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    3.5. ☰ 2.0 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    4.0. ☰ 4.0 ☰ clr.dll
    4.5. ☰ 4.0 ☰ clr.dll

  table }
