$ .NET: Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The *Common Language Runtime* is the heart of the → Microsoft/dot-net Framework.

The CLR is a *virtual machine* that provides *execution environment* for all .NET Framework code. The services of the CLR include
   • Memory management (allocation, → Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime/garbage-collector, …)
   • Type safety (See → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code#dotnet-mc-verification-process[Verifcation process for managed code])
   • Exception handling
   • Security (CAS: Code Access Security, CV: Code verification)
   • Thread management

Programs that run in the CLR is → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code (while those that run independently from it are referred to as → Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code/un).

Managed code, when started, receives a set of *permissions* from the host.

Each computer with a CLR also has a → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly/Global-Assembly-Cache.

{ CLR versions

  The CLR is not necessarily updated when the → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework advances to another version.
  -
  In fact, the CLR is somewhat independent from the Framework version that uses the CLR.
  -
  For example, a CLR whose version is less than `4.0.30319.42000` supports NET Framework versions 4 through 4.5.2. while CLRS whose version is greater
  than `4.0.30319.42000` supports .NET Framework 4.6 and higher.


  The following table shows some versions and CLR filenames:
  table { lll

   .NET Framework version ☰ CLR version ☰ CLR filename
    1.1. ☰ 1.1 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    2.0. ☰ 2.0 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    3.0. ☰ 2.0 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    3.5. ☰ 2.0 ☰ mscorwrks.dll
    4.0. ☰ 4.0 ☰ → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/clr_dll[`clr.dll`]
    4.5. ☰ 4.0 ☰ → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/clr_dll[`clr.dll`]

  table }

  In → Windows/PowerShell, the version of the CLR can be determined by quering the `Version` property of → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Environment[`System.Environment`]:
code {
PS C:\> [→ Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Environment[Environment]]::Version
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
5      0      0      -1
code }

}

  → development/databases/SQL-Server/CLR-Integration[CLR Integration] in → development/databases/SQL-Server.

  The → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Runtime/InteropServices/RuntimeEnvironment[`System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment`] class provides information
  about *Common Language Runtime Environment*.

  An *unmanaged host* calls (the deprecated) → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mscoree_dll#CorBindToRuntimeEx[`CorBindToRuntimeEx()`] (in → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/mscoree_dll[`mscoree.dll`])
  to load the CLR into a → Windows/development/process.
