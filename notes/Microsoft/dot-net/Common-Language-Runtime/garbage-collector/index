$ .NET: Garbage collector
@ garbage collector

The *garbage collector* is one of the main components of the → Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime[Common Language Runtime]: it controls how *→ Microsoft/dot-net/managed-code[managed] memory*
is allocated and when it is released.

Some aspects of the garbage collector can be controlled by the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/GC[`System.GC`] class which also provides information such as
the total amount of memory that is available in a system.

sa:

  The method `Alloc` of the class → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Runtime/InteropServices/GCHandle[`System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle`] prevents an object from being collected
  by the garbage collector.

  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/IDisposable[`System.IDisposable`]
