$ .NET assembly
@ assembly

A → Microsoft/dot-net assembly is the fundamental *reusable building block* of a *common runtime language* application: it exhibits a set of APIs, types and ressources that can be called or used by applications or other assemblies.

Assemblies are versionable and self-describing.

An assembly is created from one or more sources and compiled into
a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL or → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE.

An assembly is stored in the → Windows/development/Portable-Executable[Portable Execution (PE)] format: either as an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE or
a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL.

An assembly contains instructions that are executable in the .NET runtime (as opposed to machine instructions that are executed directly on a CPU).

One or more assemblies can be packed into a *library*.

{ Assembly manifest

  Every assembly contains an *assembly manifest* which acts as a table of content for the assembly. The manifest stores:
    • The assembly's identity (that is: name, version, culture and public key token)
    • A file table with the name of all files that make up an assembly (other .exe, .dlls or ressource files, bitmaps, readme files etc)
    • An assembly reference list

}
{ Mixed-mode assemblies

  Assemblies that were created with the C++/CLI compiler are referred to as *mixed-mode assemblies* because the contain both native and managed code.
