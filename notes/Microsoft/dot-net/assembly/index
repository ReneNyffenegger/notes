$ .NET assembly
@ assembly

A → Microsoft/dot-net assembly is a collection of types and ressources.

An assembly is created from one or more sources.

An assembly is stored in the → Windows/development/Portable-Executable[Portable Execution (PE)] format: either as an → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/EXE or
a → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL.

{ Assembly manifest

  Every assembly contains an *assembly manifest* which acts as a table of content for the assembly. The manifest stores:
    • The assembly's identity (that is: name, version, culture and public key token)
    • A file table with the name of all files that make up an assembly (other .exe, .dlls or ressource files, bitmaps, readme files etc)
    • An assembly reference list

}
{ Mixed-mode assemblies

  Assemblies that were created with the C++/CLI compiler are referred to as *mixed-mode assemblies* because the contain both native and managed code.
