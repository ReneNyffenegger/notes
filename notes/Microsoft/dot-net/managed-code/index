*Managed code* runs in and using the → Microsoft/dot-net/Common-Language-Runtime[Common Language Runtime (CLR)].

The CLR loads the (platform indipendent) MSIL that was produced by a .NET compiler and, as a second compilation step, turns it into (platform dependent) native code. (This second step is referred to
*Just in Time (JIT) compilation*).

{ Passing strings from managed to unmanaged code

  In order to pass strings from managed code to unmanaged code,
  → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/System/Runtime/InteropServices/MarshalAsAttribute[`System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute`]
  is required because managed strings are stored differently in memory than unmanaged string.  

  With the `MarshalAsAttribute` instruction, the necessary conversion will be performed.

  In order to → Windows/development/Debugging[debug] managed code, → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/SOS_dll[`SOS.dll`] and
  → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/mscordacwks_dll[`mscordacwks.dll`] is needed.
