→ Microsoft/dot-net supports multiple languages. This is possible because a .NET implementation has a *Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)* that specifies a language-independent runtime and language

→ Microsoft actively develops and supports three .NET languages:
  • C#
  • F#
  • Visual Basic (VB)
