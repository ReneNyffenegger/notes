$ .NET Standard

A given .NET Standard defines (but does not implement) the APIs that are available accross all → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations that support this standard. The individual standards are version numbered (for example 1.6 or 2.0).

.NET Standard will replace Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) as the tooling story for building multi-platform .NET libraries.

{ 1.6


}
{ 2.0

  .NET Standard 2.0 added over 20,000 APIs to 1.6. It is a strict superset of 1.6.
  -
  .NET Standard 2.0 only has 43 APIs that → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework 4.6.1 doesn't support

  .NET Standard 2.0 is supported by the following → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations
     • → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Core 2.0 or later
     • → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework 4.6.1 or later
     • Mono 5.4 or later
     • Xamarin.iOS 10.14 or later
     • Xamarin.Mac 3.8 or later
     • Xamarin.Android 8.0 or later
     • Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299 or later

  .NET Standard 2.0 is included with the → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Core 2.0 SDK and with → Windows/development/Visual-Studio 2017, 

  → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework 4.8 implements .NET Standard 2.0 and won't move to 2.1
 
}
{ 2.1

  .NET Standard will be implemented (or is already implemented?) by → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Core 3.0 as well as upcoming versions of Xamarin, Mono, and Unity.

  → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations[.NET implementation] supports the chosen version.

  → https://github.com/dotnet/standard[This github repository] contains the principles and definition of the .NET Standard.

  Especially interesting is the → https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/src/netstandard/ref[`src/netstandard/ref`]
  directory which contains `*.cs` files that define the APIs of a standard.
