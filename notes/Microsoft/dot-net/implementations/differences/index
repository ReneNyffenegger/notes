$ .NET implementation differences

→ Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Core is cross platform (→ Windows, → Linux, macOS) while → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework is Windows only.

.NET Core allows *side-by-side* installation, so different applications can use different .NET Core versions.

.NET Core is better suited for
  • microservices
  • Docker containers
  • high performance and scalable systems

.NET Framework might have
  • third party .NET libraries or NuGet packages that are not available for .NET Core

.NET Framework technologies that are not available in .NET Core
  • ASP.NET Web Forms applications
  • ASP.NET Web Pages applications
  • WCF service implementation (might be added in a future version of .NET Core).
  • Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Workflow Services (WCF + WF), WCF Data Services (formerly known as ADO.NET Data Services)
