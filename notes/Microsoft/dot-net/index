$ .NET

.NET is a software development platforms that supports multiple → Microsoft/dot-net/languages[languages].

→ Microsoft/dot-net/assembly

{ App models

  An app can be created in various models:
    • Console
    • Windows Forms
    • Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
    • ASP.NET
    • ASP.NET Core

}
{ Namespaces

  table { ll

    System.EnterpriseServices      ☰ Access to → Windows/development/COM
    System.Runtime.InteropServices ☰ Access to → Windows/development/COM

  table }

}
{ NuGet

  NuGet is the package manager for all .NET platforms.

  A *NuGet package* is essentially a set of → Windows/development/Portable-Executable/DLL[DLLs], resources and a manifest that are stuffed into a
  a → development/archive-files/zip with a `.nupkg` → development/filename-extensions[extension].

  A repository of Nuget packages is → https://www.nuget.org[nuget.org]. As of 2019-10-11, it hosts over 172'000 packages.

  There are two NuGet command line tools: → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/dotnet/dotnet_exe[`dotnet.exe`] and `nuget.exe`.

  See also → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-SDKs/NuGetPackages[`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\NuGetPackages`]

}
{ PowerShell

  The → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/type/add[`add-type` cmdLet] allows to load .NET framework classes.

  The → Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/object/new[`new-object` cmdLet] can be used to create an insance of a .NET Framework object.

}
{ TODO

  { .NET Framework Class Library (FCL)
  
    The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) is organized into a hierarchy of *namespaces*. Two common namespaces are `System.*` and `Microsoft.*`.

    The FCL is comparable in scope with the standard libraries of → development/languages/Java.

    FCL implements the CLI Base Class Library (BCL) and other class libraries.

    FCL  consists of the following libraries:
      • BCL
      • Windows Forms
      • ASP.NET
      • Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
  }
  { Base Class Library (BCL)

    The BCL provides basic features such as namespaces and classes.

    BCL is the core of FCL.

    BCL is implemented in 
    → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/mscorlib_dll[`mscorlib.dll`],
    → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/System_dll[`System.dll`] and
    → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/System_Core_dll[`System.Core.dll`].

    A *Common Type System* (CTS) defines a set of *data types* that are shared by CTS-compliant languages.
    -
    CLS is a subset of the CTS. This means that all of the rules in the CTS also apply to the CLS, unless the CLS rules are more strict.


  }
  { .NET Framework

    The .NET Framework only runs on → Windows based devices.

    The .NET Framework is constitued by a combination of BCL and FCL.

    .NET Framework is located in → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET[`%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET`] (typically `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET`).

    The last major version of .NET Framework is 4.8. It is included in the → Windows/versions/10 May 2019 Update

  }
  { .NET Core

    .NET Core is a Open Source re-implementation of .NET Framework that runs on multiple platforms (not only Windows).

    Multiple .NET Core versions can be installed on the same computer (referred to as *side-by-side*).

    .NET Core includes
      • ASP.NET Core
      • → Windows/development/Universal-Windows-Platform[Universal Windows Platform (UWP)]

    The root installation directory for .NET Core is → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/dotnet[`C:\Program Files\dotnet`].

    .NET Core was introduced in November 2014 and released in 2016.
    -
    .NET Core 3.0 was released in September 2019.

    Microsoft thinks that *new* .NET applications should be based on .NET Core.

  }
  { Common Language Runtime (CLR) #dot-net-clr

    Usually, CLR refers to the *runtime* of the → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations/Framework.

    CLR is the virtual machine of the .NET Framework which executes all programs written for .NET. It offers
      • memory management (allocation, garbage collector, …)
      • type safety
      • exception handlin
      • security (CAS: Code Access Security, CV: Code verification)
      • thread management

    A CLR converts *managed code* (intermediate language) into *machine code* and then executes it (*IL to native translation*).

    These features make .NET programs *managed*.

    Some examples of runtimes for different → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations are
    table { ll

      .NET Framework ☰ Common Language Runtime (CLR)
      .NET Core ☰ Core Common Language Runtime (CoreCLR) 
      → Windows/development/Universal-Windows-Platform[UWP] ☰ .NET Native, a *Ahead of Time* compiler.
      ? ☰ Mono runtime

    table }

    .NET Core uses CoreCLR.

    CLR implements the VES.

    The base class for all components in the common language runtime is `System.ComponentModel.Component` (which derives from `System.ComponentModel.IComponent`).

     A file without an *assembly manifest* cannot be loaded by the .NET Framework. common language runtime. (See `csc.exe -target:module`)

    The `System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment` class provides a few `static` methods that allow to query information about the CLR environment, for example in → Windows/PowerShell like so:
code {
PS C:\> [Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::SystemConfigurationFile   # 
PS C:\> [Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::GetRuntimeDirectory()     # Directory where the CLR is installed.
PS C:\> [Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::GetSystemVersion()        # Version number of CLR that is is running the current process.
code }

    → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-SDKs/Windows/version/bin/NETFX-version-Tools/clrver_exe[`clrver.exe`] displays installed CLR versions.

  }
  { CoreCLR

    CoreCLR is the runtime used as part of .NET core.

    Originally, CoreCLR was the runtime of *Silverlight*.

  }
  { CoreRT

    CoreRT is neither a virtual machine nor does it have a JIT. It has a garbage collector, though.

  }
  { Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)

?   CLI defines how program code can be translated into CIL.

    The CLI is a specification that defines
      • CTS
      • Metadata (Which can be read with *reflection*)
      • Common Language Specification (CLS)
      • Virtual Execution System (VES)

    The VES loads and executes CLI-compatible programs, using the metadata to combine separately generated pieces of code at runtime.

    The *.NET Framework* is Microsoft's original → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations[implementation] of the CLI.

    table { ll
      Specification (?) ☰ .NET Framework implementation
      Virtual Execution System (VES) ☰ Common Language Runtime
      Standard Libraries ☰ Framework Class Library

    table }

  }
  { Common Language Specification (CLS)

    The CLS specifies the *features* that a language must support that targets .NET (framework?).

    In order to be CLS compliant, only those features that are common to all .NET languages must be exposed to potential users.

    A CLS compliant .NET component (assembly?, dll?) ensures that it can be accessed from any other .NET language.

    CLS compliance is primarily of concern to library developers who want to ensure that their libraries are accessible in any language that targets the .NET Framework.

    Compliance of a component to the CLS can be verified by applying the `CLSCompliantAttribute` (in namespace `System`) in the respective source code.

  }
  { Virtual Execution System (VES)

    The VES loads and runs CLI compliant programs and enforces the CTS model. 

  }
  { Languages

    If a  → development/languages[language] is CLI compliant, it can use .NET.

    Some languages are
      • C#
      • F#
      • Visual Basic
      • C++/CLI
      • IronPython
      • Oxygene
      • Phalanger
      • …

  }
  { Managed code

    Managed code is called *managed* because its executcion is managed by a runtime (CLR).

    Managed code is written in .NET languages such as
      • C#
      • F#
      • Visual Basic
      • etc. …

    The respective compilers then produce *intermediate language* (IL).

    An instance of the `System.AppDomainManager` class represents the equivalent of an unmanaged host. It prepares an *AppDomain* before managed code runs.

    { Interoperability

      It is possible to call unmanaged code from manged code. This feature is referred to as *interoperability* (or *interop*).

    }


  }
  { (Common) Intermediate language (IL, CIL)

    Intermediate language is the product of a high-level .NET language compiler. It consists of the instruction set that is understood by the VES.

    The *intermediate language* is also referred to as *Common Intermediate Language* (CIL).
    -
    CIL was formerly called *Microsoft intermediate language* (MSIL).

    CIL is abstracted from the hardware. It defines a (CPU and platform-independent, stack based, object-oriented) binary instruction set within
    the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification.

    CIL code is taken by a CLR which then *Just-in-Time* compiles it (aka JIT-ing). The product of JIT-ing is machine code that can be executed on a CPU.

    CIL instructions are executed by a CLI-compatible runtime environment (such as the *Common Language Runtime*).

    When CIL is executed, the (platform-specific) VES compiles the CIL to *machine language* (just-in-time compilation).
    -
    It is also possible to use ahead-of-time compilation (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/ngen_exe[`ngen.exe`]).

    Compiled CIL code is stored in → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly[CLI assemblies].

   *Roslyn* is the code name for a *.NET compiler platform* that features a compiler for C# and Visual Basic .NET. These compilers create CIL from the respective source files.

    RyuJIT compiles CIL into byte code.

    → Windows/dirs/Program-Files-x86/Microsoft-SDKs/Windows/version/bin/NETFX-version-Tools/ildasm_exe[`ildasm.exe`] is an IL disassembler.


  }
  { .NET implemenations

     The four primary → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations[implementations] are:
     table { ll
        .NET Framework ☰ The *original* framework, first released in 2002. Won't probably have a version 5.0
        .NET Core ☰ Re-implementation of .NET Framework. .NET Framework will be merged into .NET Core
        Xamarin(?) / Mono(?) ☰ Xamarin was started independently from → Microsoft. Microsoft bought Xamarin in 2016.
        → Windows/development/Universal-Windows-Platform[Universal Windows Platform (UWP)] ☰
     table }

  }
  { .NET Standard


?   .NET Standard is a library that combines the APIs of .NET Framework, .NET Core and Xamarin.

    .NET Standard was introduced by Microsoft in 2016.

  }
  { Roslyn

?   Microsoft's latest C# compiler ecosystem.

    Roslyn is not included with .NET Framework; it still has the traditional `csc.exe` and `vbc.exe`.

  }
  { Mono

?   Mono started as an open source alternative to .NET Framework and is the original cross-platform implementation of .NET

    Mono is typically run with a Just-in-Time compiler but also has a ahead-of-time compiler (static compilation).

?   Mono is the runtime used as part of Xamarin.

  }
  { P/Invoke

    P/Invoke (Platform Invocation Services) is a feature of CLI implementations that allows to managed code to call native code.

?   P/Invoke seems to be .NET's equivalent for Java Native Interface.

    → http://www.pinvoke.net/ is a wiki containing P/Invoke signatures for a large number of standard → Windows/development/WinAPI[Windows APIs].

  }
  { Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

    ? WPF is a framework for UI creation, primarily intended for desktop client applications on Windows OS.

    ? WPF uses Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).

  }
  { Windows Forms

    A GUI class library with the .NET Framework.

    Windows Forms is primarily targeted for desktop applications.

  }
  { ASP.NET

    Used to develop web applications.

?   ASP.NET has access to the CLR, so ASP.NET programs can be written in different .NET languages.

  }
  { ASP.NET Core

    ASP.NET Core is a re-implementation of ASP.NET. It runs on multiple platforms (OS X, → Windows, → Linux).

  }
  { JIT

    The *Just-in-time* compiler translates IL to machine code that runs on a CPU. Thus, it is similar to a AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiler.
    However, the JIT translates code when needed and on the same machine that the machine code eventually runs.

  }
  { Tools

    Some tools that run on all → Microsoft/dot-net/implementations are
      • → Windows/development/Microsoft-Build-Engine[MSBuild]
      • NuGet (package manager)
      • CAKE, FAKE (Open source orchestration tools)
      • Project system (based on .csproj, .vbproj or .fsproj files)
      • .NET language compilers

  }
  { .NET Native

     A (Ahead-of-Time) compiler (that produces machine code) on the developer's machine.

     UWP was the first application framework that was supported by .NET Native.

  }
  { NGEN

    NGEN = *Native image GENeration*.

    NGEN compiles code typically at installation time.

   → Windows/dirs/Windows/Microsoft_NET/Framework64/vn_n_n/ngen_exe[`ngen.exe`]

  }
  { Namespaces

    Parts of namespace names are delimited by a dot (`.`).

    The `using` directive removes the necessity to specify the full namespace for every class.

    The *root* namespace is referred to with `global` (for example`global::System`).


  }
  { Common Type System CTS

    The Common Type System (CTS) is a standard (ECMA 335, Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), Partitions I to VI) that specifies how type definitions and specific values of types are represented in computer memory.
    -
    This standard allows (even different) .NET languages to share data and objects.

    A type is either
      • a value type
      • a reference type (similar to pointers)

    Common types
      • Classes
      • Structures
      • Enumerations
      • Interfaces
      • Delegates
