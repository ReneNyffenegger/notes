}
{ Web services

  There are two web services that allow to work with data and metadata in Dataverse:
  table { ll
    Web API ☰ Implements the → development/Data/OData protocol. Because built on open standards, Microsoft does not provide → Microsoft/dot-net/assembly[assemblies] for Web API.
    Organization Service ☰ Optimized for the .NET Framework. SDK assemblies in the `Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies` NuGet package provide the classes that work with the → Microsoft/dot-net/namespaces-classes/Microsoft/Xrm/Sdk/IOrganizationService[`Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService`] interface.
  table }

  { Web API

    The typical ~format of the URL~ is
    table { ll
      `https://` ☰ Protocol
      `contoso` ☰ Company («environment») name
      `crm…` ☰ Region (for example `crm4` = EMEA)
      `dynamics.com.` ☰ base URL
      `/api/data/` ☰ Web API path
      `v9.1` ☰ Version
      `…` ☰ requested resource

    table }

  }
}
