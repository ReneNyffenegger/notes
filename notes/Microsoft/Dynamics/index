{ Customization

  »Things« that can be customized:
    • Application Ribbon
    • Entity: Definition of record types / description of kinds of data. Entities correspond to a → development/databases/SQL/table[SQL table].
    • Field (which is a property of an Entity and can probably be thought of as an SQL table column or attribute)
    • Entity relationship?
    • Form
    • Business process flow
    • Message?
    • Option SEt?
    • Site Map?
    • Dashboard
    • Interface
    • Web Resource?
    • Workflow

  After customizing some *thing*, the customizing needs to be published (or deployed?).

}
{ Metadata driven architecture

  An app is customized using *PowerApps customization tools*. This basically adds or updates → development/Data/metadata[metadata].

  Metadata driven architecture promises to customize (=configure) applications without writing code. Hmm... didn't we have
  that already with → development/databases/SQL[SQL]?

}
{ Entities

  { ID (unique identifer)

    The PowerApps environment mandates all entities to have an *ID* attfibute whose value is a GUID.

  }

}
{ Relationship

  A *relationship* defines the association between two entitites.

  There are 1:n, n:1, n:n and self-referential relation types.

}
{ Views

  A *view* defines how records for an *entity* is displayed: Which columns (= field), their widths, the sort order and filters (which corresponds to
  an SQL `where` condition).

  Three types of views:
    • Personal
    • System (such as Quick Find, Advanced Find, Associated and Lookup)
    • Public

  Views are created and edited with the *app designer* or the *solution explorer*.

}
{ Forms

  { Form Scripts / Events

    Forms can trigger *events* to which so called *form scripts* can be attached.

    Such form scripts can then, for example, make sure that the data entered is valid.

  }

}
{ Solution

  A Solution is something that can be independently moved/copied accross different organizaions.

  Thus, it allows to create sellable solutions.

}
{ Qlik Microsoft Dynamics CRM Connector

  The *Qlik Microsoft Dynamics CRM Connector* lets you run FetchXML queires to fetch Microsoft Dynamics CRM data and load it directly into your *Qlik Sense* app.
