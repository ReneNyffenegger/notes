A BHO (Browser Helper Object) is basically a DLL which is connected to the Internet Explorer (and possibly to Explorer as well).

In terms of → Windows/development/COM[COM], a BHO is only required to implement IObjectWithSite.

→ development/web/browser/Internet-Explorer[Internet Explorer] uses this interface's method `SetSite`.

  I have no idea if this still works and have forgotten what it did. I include it here for archival purposes only:

  gh|Browser-Helper-Objects|/Base-Class/tq84_bho.h||

  gh|Browser-Helper-Objects|/Base-Class/tq84_bho.cpp||
