{ GPU

  Among others, Nvidia is a fabless company which designs → hardware/xPU/GPU[GPUs] and has become the dominant supplier of → development/Artificial-intelligence[artificial intelligence] hardware (and software).

}
{ CUDA

  Besides designing GPUs, Nvidia also provides CUDA which is an API that help create massively parallel programs using GPUs.

  { nvidia-smi #nvidia-smi

    → https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface[`nvidia-smi`] is a command line utility to manage and monitor Nvidia GPU chips (Tesla, Quadro, GRID and GeForce devices from the Fermi
    and higher architecture families.

    The utility is based on the → https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml[Nvidia Management Library (NVML)].

    In → Windows/Subsystem-for-Linux[WSL], a copy of `nvidia-smi` is (sometimes?) found in `→ Linux/fhs/usr/lib/wsl/lib`.
    -
    In Windows itself, a PE executable(?) is found under `→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32` (after installing the corresponding driver?)

    Display total GPU VRAM size in megabytes:
code {
$ nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.total --format=csv,noheader,nounits
code }

    See also the Python library → development/languages/Python/libraries/pyNVML[pyNVML].

   `nvcc` is Nvidia's LLVM-based C/C++ compiler.

  { nouveau

    → https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/[nouveau] aims to build high-quality, free/libre software drivers for nVidia cards (apparently by reverse engineering the original nVidia drivers?)

    Nouveau is composed of 
      • a Linux kernel KMS driver (nouveau),
      • Gallium3D drivers in Mesa, and
      • the Xorg DDX (xf86-video-nouveau).

    Nouveau tries to support all nVidia cards. However, it's deemed infeasible to document which cards and BIOSes actually work.
    -
    The → https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/FeatureMatrix.html[feature matrix] might give an idea on which features are supported on a given card family.
