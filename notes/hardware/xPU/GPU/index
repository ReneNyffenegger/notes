A GPU is specialized for compute-intensive, highly parallel computations.
-
In order to achieve this goal, compared to a CPU, more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control.

{ Single Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT)

  Nvidia introduced SIMT in the Tesla GPU microarchitecture with the G80 chip.

  ATI Technologies, now AMD, released a competing product slightly later on May 14, 2007 (the TeraScale 1-based "R600" GPU chip).

{ Determine GPU type

  { Windows

    In Windows (11?), the GPU type can be determined with
      • → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/Taskmgr_exe[Task manager] under *Performance*
      • Settings -> System -> Related settings -> Advanced display (Display information)

  }
