TPU stands for *Tensor Processing Unit*.

TPUs were developped by Google for neural network machine learning.

Compared to → hardware/xPU/GPU[GPUs], TPUs are designed for
  • a high volume of low precision computation (e.g. as little as 8-bit precision)
  • with more input/output operations per joule,
  • without hardware for rasterisation/texture mapping.

{ TPU Pod

  A TPU Pod is a set of TPUs which are connected by dedicated high-speed network interfaces.
