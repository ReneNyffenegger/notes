{ Page tables, virtual and physical memory #mem-page-table

 *Page tables* serve as a translation layer between the CPU's *virtual addresses* and the *physical addresses* on the external memory bus.

  The concepts of *virtual memory* and *page tables* was first introduced 1962 on the *Ferranti Atlas Computer* and became the de-facto
  feature of all Unix-like systems.
  -
  Intel 80386 adopted this feature (at the time of Linux 1.0) in 1985.
