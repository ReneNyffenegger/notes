APIC stands for *Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller* and is an → hardware/interrupt controller integrated in the → hardware/CPU.

APIC replaces the → https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8259[Intel 8259 programmable interupt controller (PIC)].

An I/O APIC provides more than 16 interrupt requests (IRQs), thus IRQ sharing is not required anymore which improves reliability.

An APIC is accessed through memory-mapped registers and provides
interrupt service to each CPU, used for IPIs and local → hardware/interrupt[interrupts].

APIC is programmed through the LVT (local vector timer) register.

{ IO-APIC

  An *I/O APIC* is an SMP-capable replacement for PC-Style interrupt controllers.
  Most (all?) SMP systems and many recent uniprocessor systems have one.

{ Linux CONFIG

  → Linux/kernel/CONFIG/X86_UP_APIC,
  → Linux/kernel/CONFIG/X86_UP_IOAPIC

}
{ Misc

  Apparently, Windows installs different kernels depending on the availability of APIC.

sa:
  I find it confusing that → hardware/ACPI[ACPI] has the same letters like APIC.
