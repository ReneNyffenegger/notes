abbr: Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller

An → hardware/interrupt controllor integrated in the → hardware/CPU.

? With I/O APIC, operating systems can use more than 16 interrupt requests (IRQ). Thus, interrupt sharing can be avoided which improves reliability.

An APIC is accessed through memory-mapped registers and provides
interrupt service to each CPU, used for IPIs and local → hardware/interrupt[interrupts].

APIC is programmed through the LVT (local vector timer) register.

{ IO-APIC

  An *I/O APIC* is an SMP-capable replacement for PC-Style interrupt controllers.
  Most (all?) SMP systems and many recent uniprocessor systems have one.
