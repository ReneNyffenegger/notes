{ Scancodes, keycodes and keysyms

  { Scancode #scancode

    The keyboard sends *scancodes* to the kernel.

    In a →virtual-console, the scancodes can be displayed with →Linux/shell/commands/showkey.

  }

  { Keycode #keycode

    The scancodes are mapped to *keycodes*.

  }

  { Keysym #keysym

    Depending on which →#modifier-keys are pressed, the keycodess are mapped to keysyms.

    In X, this is done by →Linux/shell/commands/xmodmap.

    A list of keysym names is found in `X11/keysymdef.h` (without XK_ prefix).

  }

}

{ Modifyer keys #modifier-keys

  Keys such as *shift*, *ctrl*, *alt* (etc?) are called *modifier keys*.
