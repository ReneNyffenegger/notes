{ Real mode

  Real mode is supported on all x86s (starting with 8086?). 
  
  x86s start in real mode.

  { Segmentation

    8086: 20-bit address, but only 16-bit registers. In order to make entire address space available, segmentation is used.

    Memory diveded into 64 KB (16-bit) chunks («segments»). Start address of segment: *segment-selector* * 16.

   }
  
 
}
{ Protected mode

  32-bit address bus instead of 20-bit.

  Paging

  { Segmentation

    No fixed 64 KB chungs anymore, instead: size and location of segements described by *segment descriptor* (which are stored in the *Global Descriptor Table* (GDT).

    { GDT

      GDT is stored in memory. It's size and address stored in `GDTR` register.

      The GDTR register contains 48 bits: 16 bits for the size of the GDT and 32 bits for its address.

      Each *descriptor* stored in a GDT is 64 bits.
