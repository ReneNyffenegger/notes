  Real mode is supported on all x86s (starting with 8086?). 
  
  x86s start in real mode.

  8086: 20-bit address, but only 16-bit registers. In order to make entire address space available, → hardware/CPUs/x86#memory segmentation[memory segmentation] is used.
  
 
}
{ Memory segmentation #memory-segmentation

  Memory diveded into 64 KB (16-bit) chunks («segments»). Start address of segment: *segment-selector* * 16.
