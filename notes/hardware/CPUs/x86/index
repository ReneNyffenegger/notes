The Intel x86 processor has a *complex instruction set computer* (CISC) architecture. This means
  • it has a *few* special-purpose → development/languages/assembler/x86/registers[registers] (rather than many general-purpose registers)
  • Complex special-purpose instructions dominate

Because the  x86 processor traces its roots back back to (at least) the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor, there are many peculiarities in the x86 instruction set that ensure backward compatibility with the 8080 (and with its Zilog Z-80 variant).

Microsoft Win32 uses the x86 processor in 32-bit flat mode.
