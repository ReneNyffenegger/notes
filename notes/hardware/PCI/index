It seems that most *things* are attached to a PC via the PCI: graphic card, memory, → hardware/USB controllers, → hardware/SATA controllers.

{ BDF #pci-bdf

  BDF (or B/D/F) stands for Bus, Device, Function. It it a 16 bit number that locates a → hardware/device[device's] function.

  The PCI specification permits a system to host up to 256 buses. (8 bits)
  
  Each bus can have up to 32 devices. (5 bits)

  Each device can have up to 8 functions. (3 bits)

  Usually, the BDF is represented in hexadecimal whose values are seperated by a colon and a dot (for example `00:1f.2`).

  The BDF can be printed with → Linux/shell/commands/lspci[`lspci`].

{ Vendor and device ID

  Every PCI has a unique vendor and device ID.

  The *device number* distinguishes between PCI devices with the same vendor and device ID.
