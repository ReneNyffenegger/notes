The partition table records a →Linux/block-device[block device's] division into →hardware/harddisk/partition[partitions].

Partition tables can be created and manipulated with →Linux/shell/commands/fdisk,
→ Linux/shell/commands/parted on Linux and → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/diskpart on → Windows/index.

The partition table traditionally used on PC → hardware/BIOS platforms is the → hardware/harddisk/MBR. But see also → hardware/UEFI.
