The partition table records a → Linux/devices#block-devices[block device's] division into →hardware/harddisk/partition[partitions].


The partition table traditionally used on PC → hardware/BIOS platforms is the → hardware/harddisk/MBR. But see also → hardware/UEFI. 

{ Determining if having MBR or GPT

  In order to determine if a harddisk has an →  hardware/harddisk/MBR[MBR] or a → hardware/harddisk/GPT[GPT], the following could do:
code {
sudo → Linux/shell/commands/parted → Linux/fhs/dev[/dev]/sda print
code }

Note: `print` (in `parted`) can be abbreviated with a simple `p`.

{ Manipulating partition tables


  Linux: 
    • → Linux/shell/commands/parted[`parted`]
    • → Linux/shell/commands/fdisk[`fdisk`]
    • → Linux/shell/commands/gdisk[`gdisk`]
    • `cgdisk`
    • `cfdisk`

  On Windows, partitition tables can apparently be manipulated with → Windows/cmd-exe/commands/diskpart.
