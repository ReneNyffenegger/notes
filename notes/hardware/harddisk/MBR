*MPR* stands for *Master Boot Record*.

The MBR is the first sector (512 bytes) on a → hardware/harddisk[harddisk].

The first 440 (446?, 444?) bytes is occupied by the *bootstrapper*.

The remaining 64(???) bytes is the → hardware/harddisk/partition-table that describes
the → hardware/harddisk/partition[partitions] on the harddisk.

{ Area between MBR and first partition #boot-track

  This area goes by various names:
  • boot track
  • MBR gap
  • embedding area

  It is usually at least 31 KB (63 sectors). For performance reasons, more modern disks align on larger boundaries, so the first partition might start
  at 1 MiB.

{ Limitations

  Partition size limit of 2TiB.
