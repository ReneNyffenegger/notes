abbr: Master Boot Record


The MBR is the first sector on → hardware/harddisk/index. Its size is 512 bytes of which 446 is a small piece of code and the remaining 64 bytes are the → hardware/harddisk/partition-table that describe
the → hardware/harddisk/partition[partitions] on the harddisk.

{ Area between MBR and first partition #boot-track

  This area goes by various names:
  • boot track
  • MBR gap
  • embedding area

  It is usually at least 31 KB (63 sectors). For performance reasons, more modern disks align on larger boundaries, so the first partition might start
  at 1 MiB.

{ Limitations

  Partition size limit of 2TiB.
