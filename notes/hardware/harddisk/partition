→ Linux/devices#block-devices[Block devices] can be divided into one or more partitions. The layout of the parititions is recorded in the → hardware/harddisk/partition-table
which is usually found in sector 0 of the disk. (BSD users speak of *disk slices* and *disk labels*).


{ Determine the file system of a partition

 `file -sL /dev/sda4`

 `lsblk -f` (→Linux/shell/commands/lsblk)

  On Windows: `diskpart list disk` (→ Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/diskpart_exe[`diskpart.exe`]).
 
}

{ Directories required for booting

  The directories → Linux/fhs/etc/index and → Linux/fhs/usr/index are required in the boot process. Therefore, they should be in the root partition, or mounted early.

}

{ Tools to manage partitions

 `→ Linux/shell/commands/fdisk`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/gdisk`, `→ Linux/shell/commands/parted`, `partx` etc.

}

{ TODO

 → Linux/filesystem/filesystems#btrfs partitioning (seems to replace →  hardware/harddisk/MBR and → hardware/harddisk/GPT partitioning).

  { CHS - Cylinder, Head, Sector

    CHS (cylinder, head, sector) addressing has never been important for Linux.

    Solid state drives don't have physical cylinders or heads anyway.


  }

}

sa:

 `→ Linux/fhs/proc/partitions` lists major and minor numbers of partitioned devices as well as their names in `→ Linux/fhs/dev`.

  → projects/Partition-tables-and-file-systems

  Remove an old partition with `wipefs`.
