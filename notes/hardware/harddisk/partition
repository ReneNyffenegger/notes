→Linux/block-device[block devices] can be divided into one or more partitions. This division is recorded in the → hardware/harddisk/partition-table.

{ Determine the file system of a partition

`file -sL /dev/sda4`

`lsblk -f` (→Linux/shell/commands/lsblk)

On Windows: `diskpart list disk` (→ Windows/cmd-exe/commands/diskpart).

}

{ Directories required for booting

  The directories → Linux/fhs/etc/index and → Linux/fhs/usr/index are required in the boot process. Therefore, they should be in the root partition, or mounted early.

}

{ Tools to manage partitions

 → Linux/shell/commands/fdisk, → Linux/shell/commands/gdisk, → Linux/shell/commands/parted, etc.

}

{ TODO

 → Linux/filesystems#btrfs partitioning (seems to replace →  hardware/harddisk/MBR and → hardware/harddisk/GPT partitioning).

}
