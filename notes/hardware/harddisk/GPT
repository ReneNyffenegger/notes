abbr: GUID Partition Table

GPT fixes some/many problems of → hardware/harddisk/MBR.

GPT needs → hardware/UEFI/index.


{ Layout on harddisk

A GPT disk has still an → hardware/harddisk/MBR →partition-table on the first sector of the disk (the *protective MBR*) to prevent MBR-only partitioniong tools from overwriting GPT disks.

When executing `gdisk /dev/sda`, it might print (note the `Found valid GPT with protective MBR`):
code {
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0

Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: present

Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

Command (? for help): 
code }

The GPT is (usually?) in the 2nd sector (LBA 1).

The first → hardware/harddisk/partition (usually) starts with sector 2048.
