abbr: GUID Partition Table

→ hardware/UEFI/index[UEFI] needs a GPT, it does not work with an MBR-partitioned disk.

{ Fixing problems of MBR


  Advantages of GPT over MBR include
    • Logical Block Addresses (LBAs) are 64 bits rather than 32 bits (and is therefore not limited to 2 TiB = 2³²*512, 512 being the block size)
    • Supports many partitions (rather than just four primary partitions).
    • Provides both a primary and backup partition table for redundancy.
    • Uses version number and size fields for future expansion.
    • Uses CRC32 fields for improved data integrity.
    • Defines a GUID for uniquely identifying each partition (Hence the name GPT)
    • Uses a GUID and attributes to define partition content type.
    • Each partition contains a 36 character human readable name.
    • → hardware/UEFI[UEFI] cannot boot from an MBR disk.

{ Layout on harddisk

  A GPT disk starts with a 512 byte large *protective MBR* (where an ordinary → hardware/harddisk/MBR[MBR] would be) to prevent MBR-only partitioning tools from overwriting GPT disks.
  -
  This protective MBR contains an entry to an inexisting 2 TiB large partition (with code `EE00`). Thus, the MBR-only partitioning tool thinks the entire disk is occupied.

When executing `gdisk /dev/sda`, it might print (note the `Found valid GPT with protective MBR`):
code {
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0

Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: present

Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

Command (? for help): 
code }

  The *GPT header* is stored in the 2nd sector (LBA 1) and is followed by the *GPT partition entry array*.
  -
  The minimum size reserved for the GPT partition entry array is 32 blocks (sectors?), i.e. with block size 512 = 16 KiB.

  The first → hardware/harddisk/partition (usually) starts with sector 2048.

}
{ ESP

  A GPT formatted harddisk must have one → hardware/UEFI/ESP[EFI system partition (ESP)].

}

{ Partition type

  With →Linux/shell/commands/parted: `parted /dev/disk set partition-number bios_grub on`
  
  With → Linux/shell/commands/gdisk: use partition type `0xEF02`.
  
  Otherwise, set → development/UUID-GUID[GUID] to `21686148-6449-6e6f-744e656564454649`.

  → Linux/shell/commands/sgdisk

  → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/MBR2GPT_EXE[`MBR2GPT.EXE`] converts a disk with a MBR partition to a GPT partition.
