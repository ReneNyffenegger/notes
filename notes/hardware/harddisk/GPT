abbr: GUID Partition Table

GPT fixes some/many problems of → hardware/harddisk/MBR.

GPT needs → hardware/UEFI/index.


{ Layout on harddisk

A GPT disk has still an → hardware/harddisk/MBR → hardware/harddisk/partition-table on the first sector of the disk (the *protective MBR*) to prevent MBR-only partitioniong tools from overwriting GPT disks.

When executing `gdisk /dev/sda`, it might print (note the `Found valid GPT with protective MBR`):
code {
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0

Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: present

Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

Command (? for help): 
code }

The GPT is (usually?) in the 2nd sector (LBA 1).

The first → hardware/harddisk/partition (usually) starts with sector 2048.

{ Partition type

With →Linux/shell/commands/parted: `parted /dev/disk set partition-number bios_grub on`

With → Linux/shell/commands/gdisk: use partition type `0xEF02`.

Otherwise, set GUID to `21686148-6449-6e6f-744e656564454649`.
