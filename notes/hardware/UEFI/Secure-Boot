$ UEFI Secure Boot

→ hardware/UEFI[UEFI] Secure Boot uses cryptographic checksums and signatures to make sure that the code (typically boot loaders or firmware updaters) which is started by a computer's UEFI firmware can be trusted (i. e. does not contain unauthorized and malicious code).

? Most x86 hardware has Microsoft/Windows keys. Thus, in order to install a Linux system, either an extra step is required (add new keys) or Secure Boot must be disabled in the firmware configuration.

{ Misc

  KEK is the *Key Exchange Key* database, found on the motherboard.
