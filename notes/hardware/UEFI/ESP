The ESP is a → hardware/harddisk/partition formatted as FAT32. One ESP must be present in all → hardware/harddisk/GPT[GPT] formatted disks.

The partition code of an ESP is `EF02`.

→ https://wiki.archlinux.de/title/UEFI_Installation claims that the minimum size of the EFI partition is 512 MiB because FAT32 requires at least that much.

  The ESP contains the →development/boot-loader for all installed operating systems, the device drivers and system programs that run before the operating system is started.

  This is one of the big advantages of → hardware/UEFI/index over → hardware/BIOS/index: Every operating system can install the files it needs into the ESP.
