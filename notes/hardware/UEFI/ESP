abbr: EFI system partition
wp: EFI_system_partition

The ESP is a → hardware/harddisk/partition formatted as FAT32. One ESP must be present in all → hardware/harddisk/GPT[GPT] formatted disks.

Usually, the ESP is around 200-250 MB and resides on a disk's first → hardware/harddisk/partition (e.g. → Linux/fhs/dev/sdX[`/dev/sda1`).

The partition code of an ESP is `EF02` (→ Linux/shell/commands/gdisk[`gdisk`]).
-
→ Linux/shell/commands/parted[`parted`] shows such a parition with the `/boot` flag. (Note: in a → hardware/harddisk/MBR[MBR] partitioned harddisk, the boot flag has
a different meaning).

→ https://wiki.archlinux.de/title/UEFI_Installation claims that the minimum size of the EFI partition is 512 MiB because FAT32 requires at least that much.

  The ESP contains the →development/boot-loader for all installed operating systems, the device drivers and system programs that run before the operating system is started.

  This is one of the big advantages of → hardware/UEFI/index over → hardware/BIOS/index: Every operating system can install the files it needs into the ESP.
