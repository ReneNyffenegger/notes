An interrupt is caused by a software (mostly for → Linux/kernel/sys-calls[sys-calls]), hardware (for example: pressing a key on the keyboard), or by an exception (for example division by zero)

Interrupts are handled in the *interrupt handler* in the → hardware/CPU.

{ Interrupt controllers

  Systems often use an interrupt controller to group device interrupts before passing an interrupt to the → hardware/CPU. This saves interrupt pins on the CPU and adds to the
  flexibility.
