All → hardware/PC[PCs] (even Alpha machines) are equipped with a *real time clock*. This clock keeps
the date when the PC is turned off.

{ Generating signals #signals

  The clock can be used to generate signals from 2 HZ up to 8192 HZ in increments of
  powers of two.  

  These signales are reported through → hardware/interrupt[interrupts] (→ hardware/PC/interrupts#irq8[IRQ 8]).

}

{ Standardization

  The functionality of such a clock is standardized by → hardware/ACPI.

}

{ Hardware

  This clock could either be built into the chipset of the PC or be a → hardware/Motorola-MC146818 or a MC146818 clone.
