abbr: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface

ACPI let the operating system control *power management*, rather than the → hardware/BIOS[BIOS].

ACPI superseeds and replaces its predecessors *APM* (Advanced Power Management), the *MultiProcessor Specification* and PnP (Plug and Play).

{ TODO

  → development/security: *Mark Shuttleworth* has likened ACPI to *Trojan Horses*.

}

sa:
  I find it confusing that → hardware/APIC[APIC] has the same letters like ACPI
