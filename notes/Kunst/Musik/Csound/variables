$ Csound variables

The first letter of a variable determines its type:
  • `i`: They're set at the initialization of an instrument.
  • `k`: control variables. Updated each control cycle
  • `a`: audio variables. Unlike control variables, they are a vector. Updated each control cycle 
  • `p`: score parameter fields
  • `S`: string variables

Then, there are also the *spectral data types* (the older w-type and the newer f-rate). Apparently, they're used by the pvs → Kunst/Musik/Csound/Opcodes[opcodes].
