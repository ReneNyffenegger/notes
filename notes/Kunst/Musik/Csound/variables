$ Csound variables

The first letter of a variable determines its type:
  • `i`: They're set at the initialization of an → Kunst/Musik/Csound/instrument (→ Kunst/Musik/Csound/init-pass).
  • `k`: control variables. Updated each control cycle
  • `a`: audio variables. Unlike control variables, they are a vector whose size is `ksmps`. Usually, they store audio samples. Updated each control cycle 
  • `p`: score parameter fields
  • `S`: string variables
Global variables: see → Kunst/Musik/Csound/init-pass#initialize-global-vars[initializing global vars etc].

Then, there are also the *spectral data types* (the older w-type and the newer f-rate). Apparently, they're used by the pvs → Kunst/Musik/Csound/Opcodes[opcodes].

{ Converting between types

  { a to k

  `downsamp`, by default, takes the first value of an a-variable array and assigns it to a k-variable. With the `iwlen` parameter, a lenghth of the sub array
  can be defined of which the avarage is taken.

  `max_k` finds the max or min value in the a-array.

  `rms`

  `samphold`

  }
  { k to a

    `avar = kvar`: all elements in `avar` are set to `kvar`'s value. `upsamp` is equivalent, but less efficient.

    `interp` which is equivalent to `avar=a(kvar)`.

  }
  { i to k

    `kval` = `ival`

  }
  { k to i

    Problematic because the `kvar` might not be initized at the → Kunst/Musik/Csound/init-pass.

  }

}

{ Accessing elements in a-arrays

  `vaget` and `vaset`

}
{ Printing variables

  `print` → Kunst/Musik/Csound/Opcodes[opcode].
