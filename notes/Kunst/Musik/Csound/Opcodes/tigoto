`tigoto` will jump to `label` if the → Kunst/Musik/Csound/tied-notes[note is tied].

Usually, this opcode is used to skip an instrument's initilazation code (which immediatly follows the `tigoto` statement).

`tigoto` belongs to the *goto family* of → Kunst/Musik/Csound/Opcodes[opcodes].

  → Kunst/Musik/Csound/Opcodes/tival
