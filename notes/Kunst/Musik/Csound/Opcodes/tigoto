$ Csound opcode: tigoto
@ tigoto

code {
tigoto label:
code }

`tigoto` will jump to `label` if the → Kunst/Musik/Csound/tied-notes[note is tied].

Usually, this opcode is used to skip an instrument's initilazation code (which immediately follows the `tigoto` statement).

`tigoto` belongs to the *goto family* of → Kunst/Musik/Csound/Opcodes[opcodes].
