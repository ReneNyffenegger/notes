{ White noise

  White noise = Johnson noise.

  In white noise, there is no correlation in between successive frequencies.

 "
   To be white is to be colorless. White noise is a colorless hiss
   that is just as dull whether you play it faster or slower.
   It's autocorrelation function, which measures how its fluctuations
   at any moment are related to previous fluctations is zero.
 " [ Martin Gardener - White and brown music ]

}
{ Brown noise
  
  Brown noise gets its name from the random walks of physical Brownian motion.

  Each frequency is a random deviation of the previous frequency.


}
{ Pink noise

  While white noise has no correlation between successive frequncies and brown noise
  has a very strong correlation, pink noise lies between.

  Pink noise is sometimes referred to as *1/f noise* (Voss & Clarke, 1978).

  Gardner described 1978 a method to approximate pink noise. The method was invented
  by Voss.
