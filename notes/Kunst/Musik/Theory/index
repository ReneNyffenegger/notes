{ White noise

  White noise = Johnson noise.

 "
   To be white is to be colorless. White noise is a colorless hiss
   that is just as dull whether you play it faster or slower.
   It's autocorrelation function, which measures how its fluctuations
   at any moment are related to previous fluctations is zero.
 " [ Martin Gardener - White and brown music ]
