{ Four phases when drawing

  A graph is created in four phases:
    • Break cycles so that the graph becomes acyclic
    • Assign a *rank* for each *node* (usually y-coordinate).
    • Order nodes on same rank to avoid crossing (of edges?)
    • Create splines between nodes

}
{ Useful command line options

  Setting dpi (or resulution) of generated graphs: `-Gdpi=300`.

}
{ Strings vs HTML strings

  Ordinary strings are delimited with apostrophes: `"…"`

  HTML strings are delimited by angle bracktes: `<…>`
