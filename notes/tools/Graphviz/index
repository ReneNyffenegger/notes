Graphviz stands for *graph visualization software*. Graphs are created by describing them in a specifically created language: → tools/Graphviz/dot.
-
Some exaamples can be found → tools/Graphviz/examples[here].

{ Some important attributes

  Some (imho) important → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attributes] and → tools/Graphviz/attributes/types[attribute types] are
    • → tools/Graphviz/attributes/style[`style`]
    • → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label`]
    • → tools/Graphviz/attributes/shape[`shape`] (for → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[nodes])
    • → tools/Graphviz/attributes/_color[Color related attributes]

}
{ Four phases when drawing

  A graph is created in four phases:
    • Break cycles so that the graph becomes acyclic
    • Assign a *rank* for each *node* (usually y-coordinate).
    • Order nodes on same rank to avoid crossing (of edges?)
    • Create splines between nodes

}
{ Useful command line options

  Setting dpi (or resulution) of generated graphs: `-Gdpi=300`.

}
{ Strings vs HTML strings

  Ordinary strings are delimited with apostrophes: `"…"`

  HTML strings are delimited by angle bracktes: `<…>`
