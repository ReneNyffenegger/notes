$ dot language

The dot language allows to *describe directed or undirected graphs*.

{ Keywords #graphviz-keyword

  The dot language consists of six keywords only:
    • → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[`node`]
    • → tools/Graphviz/elems/edge[`edge`]
    • → tools/Graphviz/elems/graph[`graph`]
    • `digraph` (digraph stands for directed graph)
    • → tools/Graphviz/elems/subgraph[`subgraph`]
    • `strict` (Only applicable to `graph` and `digraph`)

  These keywords are case insensitive.

}
{ Comments

  graphviz has the same comment style as → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus[C++]:
code {
/*
  comment
  comment
*/

// comment
code }

  Lines that start with a `#` are discarded as well.

}
{ Statements

  Statements might be optionally ended with a semicolon (`;`).

}
