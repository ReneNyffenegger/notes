$ Graphviz: subgraph
@ subgraph

A subgraph whose ID starts with `cluster_` is a → tools/Graphviz/elems/cluster

The only → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute] that is applicable on a non-cluster subgraph is `rank`.

{ Creating subgraphs

  A subgraph is enclosed in opening and closing curly parantheses.

  Optionally, the subgraph can be explicitely stated as such with the → tools/Graphviz/dot/language#graphviz-keywords[keyword] `subgraph`.
  If this keyword is used, the subgraph might also optionally be named with an *ID*.

  Finally, if the ID starts with `cluster`, the subgraph becomes a *cluster*.

  The following example creates four subgraphs that demonstrate each of the four variations:
  gh|about-Graphviz|/elems/subgraph/with-without-keyword.dot||

  gh|about-Graphviz|/elems/subgraph/img/with-without-keyword.png||

}
{ A subgraph allows to specify attributes for elements within the subgraph

  Attributes that are set in an *attribute statement* are valid within the subgraph that they're defined in:
  gh|about-Graphviz|/elems/subgraph/attribute-context.dot||

  gh|about-Graphviz|/elems/subgraph/img/attribute-context.png||

}
