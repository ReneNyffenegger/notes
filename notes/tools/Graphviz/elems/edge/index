$ Graphviz: edge
@ edge

By default, an edge is drawn with a *solid* line. In order to change that (for example to hide the edge), its
→ tools/Graphviz/attributes/style[`style`] attribute must be set (for example to `invis`).

Typically, an *edge* → tools/Graphviz/elems/node#graphviz-node-ranking[ranks] the → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[nodes] it connects. This can be turned off by setting the edge's → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute]
→ tools/Graphviz/attributes/constraint[`constraint`] to `false`.
