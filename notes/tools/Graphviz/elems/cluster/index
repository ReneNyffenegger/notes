A *cluster* is a → tools/Graphviz/elems/subgraph whose ID starts with `cluster_`.

{ Labeling clusters #labeling-clusters

  The → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label`] attribute labels a cluster. It has no effect, however, in → tools/Graphviz/elems/subgraph[subgraphs].

  An, imho, hackish way to connect clusters is to use the attributes → tools/Graphviz/attributes/compound[`compound`], `ltail` and `lhead`.

  See the demonstration under → tools/Graphviz/attributes/compound[`compound`].
