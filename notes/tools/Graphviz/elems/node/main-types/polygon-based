$ Graphviz: polygon based nodes

A *polygon based* → tools/Graphviz/elems/node is one of the three *main types* of nodes, the two others being → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record based based] and *user defined*.

The geometry of a polygon based node is affected by the → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attributes]
  • `regular`
  • `peripheries`
  • `orientation`
Additionally, if `→ tools/Graphviz/attributes/shape[shape] = polygon`, the following attributes are also used:
  • `sides` (default = 4)
  • `skew` (default = 0)
  • `distortion` (default = 0)

A `shape=point` is only affected by
  • `peripheries`
  • `width`
  • `height`


{ Size of a (polygon based?) shape

  The size and geometry of all → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[nodes] is affected by the following → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attributes]:
    • `fixedsize`
    • `fontname`
    • `fontsize`
    • `height`
    • `label`
    • `style`
    • `width`

  The size of a (only polygon based?) shape is (additionally?) determined by the smallest width and height that is needed to contain its → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label`] and image (if so specified) plus the value of the
  `margin` attribute. The values of the `width` and `height` attribute specify the minimum size. See also `fixedsize` (if `fixedsize=shape`, the size of the node equals `width` and `height`).
