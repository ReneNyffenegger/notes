$ Graphviz: record based nodes

A *record based* → tools/Graphviz/elems/node is one of the three *main types* of nodes, the two others being → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/polygon-based[polygon based] and *user defined*.

A node becomes record based if its → tools/Graphviz/attributes/shape[`shape` attribute] is either `record` or `Mrecord`.

A record based node consists of fields that are visually drawn as rectangles. A field contains text or sub-fields.

If a node is record based, the string that is assigned to the → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[node's] → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label` attribute] may contain three special instructions:
  • The vertical bar (`|`) seperates fields from one another in the record
  • Curly braces (`{…}`) change the layout-orientation for sub-fields within a field
  • A field can be given a *port name* within angle brackets at the beginning of a field (`<portName>field text`) which allows to connect fields to one another with → tools/Graphviz/elems/edge[edges].

The initial layout-orientation is determined by the → tools/Graphviz/attributes/rankdir[`rankdir`] attribute of the → tools/Graphviz/elems/graph.

{ Example

  The following example tries to demonstrate some of the features of record based nodes:

{ HTML like labels

  Instead of using record based labels, one might consider to use → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label/HTML-like[HTML like labels].
