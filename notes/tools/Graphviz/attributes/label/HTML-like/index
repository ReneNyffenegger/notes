$ Graphviz: HTML like labels

If the value of an → tools/Graphviz/elems[element's] → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label` attribute] is delimited by angle brackets `label = < … >`, the value of the label is interpreted
as → development/web/HTML[HTML]-like text where the following → development/web/HTML/tags[tags] are understood
  • `<b>`
  • `<br/>`
  • → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label/HTML-like/font[`<font>`]
  • `<hr>`
  • `<i>`
  • `<img>` (in `<td>…</td>` only)
  • `<o>`
  • `<s>`
  • `<sub>`
  • `<sup>`
  • `<table>`
  • `<tr>`
  • `<u>`
  • `<vr>`

{ Text alignment in tables

  The following example tries to demonstrate how text is aligned in tables.

  The `<td>` elements should have the attribute `align` set to the value `text`. This ensures that the width of `<td>` one below the other have the same extension in both directions.

  The alignment of the individual text portions are indicated with the `align` attribute within a *closing* `<br/>` tag.

}
{ shape=plain

  When using HTML like labels, it's probably a good thing to use `→ tools/Graphviz/attributes/shape[shape]=plain` (which is equivalent to `shape=none width=0 height=0 margin=0`).
