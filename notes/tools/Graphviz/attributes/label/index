$ Graphviz - label attribute
@ label

The `label` → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute] specifies the text that is shown with the following
→ tools/Graphviz/elems[elements]: → tools/Graphviz/elems/node, → tools/Graphviz/elems/edge and → tools/Graphviz/elems/cluster. 
-
The `label` attribute has no effect on → tools/Graphviz/elems/subgraph[subgraphs], see → tools/Graphviz/elems/cluster#labeling-clusters[this demonstration].

The → tools/Graphviz/attributes/types[type] of the `label` attribute is → tools/Graphviz/attributes/types/lblString[`lblString`].

In → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record based nodes], the value of the `label` can contains some special instructions like the vertical bar or curly braces.

The → design/font/font that is used to render a label is controlled with the → tools/Graphviz/attributes/font/name[`fontname` attribute].

{ HTML like lables

  Typically, the label is just a string that is enclosed in quotes (`label = "some text"`).

  However, if angle brackes are used (`label = < <table> … >`), Graphviz renders labels → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label/HTML-like[with HTML tags].

{ Giving a graph a title

  A label that is not part of an edge or a node gives a title to a graph.

  By default, this title is rendered at the graph's bottom. In order to render it on the top, the value of `labelloc` needs to be set to `t`.
