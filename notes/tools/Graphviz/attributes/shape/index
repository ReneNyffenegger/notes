$ Graphviz - shape attribute
@ shape

The `shape` attribute → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute] specifies the shape for → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[nodes].

`shape` is both, the *name* of an → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute] and the → tools/Graphviz/attributes/types[type] of the attribute `shape`. 

{ Main shape types

 Graphviz has three (main?) types of shapes:
  • polygon-based shapes
  • → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record-based] shapes (which are superseeded by *HTML like labels*).
  • user-defined

{ Some important shape values

  table { lll
    
              ☰ ~Comments~ ☰ ~Synonyms~
  `box`       ☰ ☰ `rect`, `rectangle`
  `square`    ☰ ☰
  `none`      ☰ ☰ `plaintext`
  `plain`     ☰ Similar to `shape=none` but enforces `width=0 height=0 margin=0`. This guarantees that the size of a → tools/Graphviz/elems/node is determined by its → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label`]. ☰
  `plaintext` ☰ ☰
  `point`     ☰ ☰
  `record`    ☰ Creates a → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record based node] ☰
  `Mrecord`   ☰ Creates a → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record based node] ☰
