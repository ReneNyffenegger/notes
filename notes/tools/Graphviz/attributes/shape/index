$ Graphviz - shape attribute
@ shape

The `shape` → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute] specifies the shape for → tools/Graphviz/elems/node[nodes].

`shape` is both, the *name* of an → tools/Graphviz/attributes[attribute] and the → tools/Graphviz/attributes/types[type] of the attribute `shape`.

{ Main shape types

 Graphviz has three (main?) types of shapes:
  • polygon-based shapes
  • → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record-based] shapes (which are superseeded by → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label/HTML-like[HTML like labels]).
  • user-defined

}

{ Some interesting shape values

  Graphviz comes with a → http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html[quite a list of shapes]. The most interesting and useful, imho, are the following:
  table { lll
                 ☰ ~Comments~ ☰ ~Synonyms~
  `box`          ☰ ☰ `rect`, `rectangle`
  `circle`       ☰ ☰
  `cylinder`     ☰ ☰
  `doublecircle` ☰ ☰
  `none`         ☰ not available in version 2.38 ☰ `plaintext`
  `Mrecord`      ☰ Creates a → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record based node] ☰
  `plain`        ☰ Similar to `shape=none` but enforces `width=0 height=0 margin=0`. This guarantees that the size of a → tools/Graphviz/elems/node is determined by its → tools/Graphviz/attributes/label[`label`]. Not available in version 2.38 ☰
  `plaintext`    ☰ ☰
  `point`        ☰ ☰
  `record`       ☰ Creates a → tools/Graphviz/elems/node/main-types/record-based[record based node] ☰
  `square`       ☰ ☰
  `underline`    ☰ ☰

  table }

  The default value for `shape` is `ellipse`.
