$ Graphviz - compound attribute
$ compound

`compound` is a boolean that controls if → tools/Graphviz/elems/cluster[clusters] can be connected with `lhead` and `ltail`.

The following example is → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor[preprocessed], once by defining the → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/preprocessor/macros[macro] `COMPOUND` to false and once to `true`. With
Microsoft's compiler → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl[`cl`], this is achieved like so:
code {
P:\ath\to\xyz> → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/E-P-EP[cl -E] → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/D[-D]COMPOUND=true  connect-clusters.dot_ | dot -Tpng -o img\connect-clusters-true.png
P:\ath\to\xyz> → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/E-P-EP[cl -E] → Windows/development/Visual-Studio/cl/options/D[-D]COMPOUND=false connect-clusters.dot_ | dot -Tpng -o img\connect-clusters-false.png
code }

{ connect-clusters.dot_

  `connect-clusters.dot_` is the file that needs to be preprocessed:
  gh|about-Graphviz|/attributes/compound/connect-clusters.dot_||

}
{ Created images


  The following image is created with `compound=true`. The → tools/Graphviz/elems/edge[edges] (arrows) between the clusters
  are only drawn outside of the clusters:
  gh|about-Graphviz|/attributes/compound/img/connect-clusters-true.png||

  This image is created with `compound=false`. The → tools/Graphviz/elems/edge[edges] are drawn for their entire length:
  gh|about-Graphviz|/attributes/compound/img/connect-clusters-false.png||

}
