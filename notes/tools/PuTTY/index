{ Stored Sessions

  A stored session can be used when PuTTY is started from the command line:
code {
putty.exe -load name-of-stored-session
code }

  PuTTY stores sessions in the → Windows/registry[registry] under `HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions`.

  Interesting options to be set there are:
