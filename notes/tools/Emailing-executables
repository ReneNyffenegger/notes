Some companies have a policy that wouldn't allow to receive or send executables (such as `*.dll`, `*.exe`, `*.bat` etc.) via e-mail. Such attachments are filtered by some filtering mechanisms.

Sometimes, the filter can be circumvented by sending the attachments in a → development/archive-files/zip[zip file]. However, as the filters get smarters, they will even check the content of a `*.zip` file and block
the transmission if it contains such an executable.

The solution to this problem is to rename the suffix of the attachments so that the filter won't become suspicous.

This is done by the → development/languages/Perl/[Perl] script `send_directory_via_mail.pl` which must be called like so:
code {
send_directory_via_mail.pl c:\path\to\directory sender.email@somewhere.foo mail.server.foo receiver.email@somewhere.else.bar authenticationForMailServer
code }

The receiver of the mail then uses `receive_directory_from_outlook.pl` to unzip the sent attachment and restore the suffixes to the original names.

{ send_directory_via_mail.pl

  gh|SendDirectoryWithMail|/send_directory_via_mail.pl||

}
{ receive_directory_from_outlook.pl

  gh|SendDirectoryWithMail|/receive_directory_from_outlook.pl||

}

  → Microsoft/Office/Outlook
