{ Using External Editor to edit messages with gvim #external-editor

  →http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&pg=2[External Editor] allows to open and edit messages with gvim.

  { Getting External Editor

     As it is an unofficial plugin, I had to download it with `→tools/wget http://globs.org/file/exteditor_v100.xpi`. (The «normal» install wouldn't work).

  }
  { Installing it

    Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions. Click on «tools» symbol (screwdriver and wrench) in the top. -> Install Add-on From File.

    Restart Thunderbird.

    Modify preferences (still in Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions): Set *Text Editor* = `gvim -f`. (`-f` is for *no fork*).

    Adding the *External Editor* button to the toolbar: File -> New -> Message, then View -> Toolbars -> Customize..., then drag *External Editor* to toolbar of new message.

  }
  { Using it

    Messages can now be edited with `ctrl-e`.

  }

}


{ Adding a signature

  In left most pane, click on email address (right above *Inbox*) for which a signature is to be added.

  Click *view settings for this account*.

}
{ Passwords

  *Showing → development/security/password[passwords]*: Edit -> Preferences -> Security -> Saved Passwords

  *Changing password*: go to password panel as above, then delete password, then get mails. Thunderbird will ask for new password.

}
{ Extensions

  Extensions come as `*.xpi` files, which are, in fact, a zip file.

}
{ Misc

  The *keyboard shortcut* to add an attachment is `ctrl+shift+A`.

  { Opening/closing folders

    Make *

    Above the left pane that shows the accounts is a drop down that can be set to
      • All folders
