{ Menu bar

  Right click somewhere in the top allows to show/hide the menu bar.

}
{ One line per message (table view)

  Somewhere in the top right area above the messages is a *Quick Filter* (not to be confused with the *Filter these messages* input). Right to the Quick Filter is an icon that allows to choose between *Table view* and *Cards view*.

}
{ Settings menu

  The *Settings* menu is «hidden behind» the three horizontal bars close to the top right corner of the Thunderbird GUI, not, as possibly expected, under the *Tools* menu.

}
{ Installing Thunderbird #thunderbird-install

  On → Windows, Thunderbird can be installed with → Windows/Chocolatey:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco_exe[choco] install -y thunderbird
code }

}
{ Adding accounts

  { gmail

    When adding a gmail-based account, only the email address and name need to be entered, *but not the password*.
    -
    Thunderbird will then open a → Companies-Products/Google sign-in page where the password can be entered.

  }

}
{ Writing messages in or without HTML format

  In left pane: Right mouse click on account -> Settings -> Composition & Addressing -> (un)tick Compose messages in HTML format.

}
{ Embedded images are not sent

  Observation:
    • Images that are inserted (not attached) with Insert -> Image… are not sent to the recipient
    • The account's settings for *Composition & Addressing* have the item *Compose messages in HTML format* checked

  Solution: Set value of of *Sending Format* in *Thunderbird Settings* under *Composition* to *Automatic*.

}
{ Using External Editor to edit messages with gvim #external-editor

  →http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&pg=2[External Editor] allows to open and edit messages with gvim.

  { Getting External Editor

     As it is an unofficial plugin, I had to download it with `→tools/wget http://globs.org/file/exteditor_v100.xpi`. (The «normal» install wouldn't work).

  }
  { Installing it

    Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions. Click on «tools» symbol (screwdriver and wrench) in the top. -> Install Add-on From File.

    Restart Thunderbird.

    Modify preferences (still in Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions): Set *Text Editor* = `gvim -f`. (`-f` is for *no fork*).

    Adding the *External Editor* button to the toolbar: File -> New -> Message, then View -> Toolbars -> Customize..., then drag *External Editor* to toolbar of new message.

  }
  { Using it

    Messages can now be edited with `ctrl-e`.

  }

}

  In left most pane, click on email address (right above *Inbox*) for which a signature is to be added.

  Click *view settings for this account*.

}
{ Passwords

  *Showing → development/security/password[passwords]*: Edit -> Preferences -> Security -> Saved Passwords

  *Changing password*: go to password panel as above, then delete password, then get mails. Thunderbird will ask for new password.

}
{ Extensions

  Extensions come as `*.xpi` files, which are, in fact, a zip file.

}
{ Misc

  The *keyboard shortcut* to add an attachment is `ctrl+shift+A`.

  { Opening/closing folders

    Make *

    (top right) -> Options -> tick *Fold Pane Toolbar*.

    Above the left pane that shows the accounts is a drop down that can be set to
      • All folders
      • Unread folders
      • Favorite folders
      • Unified folders (This one seems to open all folders)

    See also Menu: View->Folders.
