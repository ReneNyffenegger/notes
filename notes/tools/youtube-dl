$ Download youtube videos with youtube-dl

`youtube-dl` allows to download youtube movies from a → Linux/shell[shell] or → Windows/dirs/Windows/System32/cmd_exe[cmd.exe].

Except in → Windows environments, `youtube-dl` needs → development/languages/Python to run.

{ Some command line options

Download → tools/mp3[mp3] only:
code {
youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=........
code }
See also → development/tools/scripts/personal/yt2mp3_bat[`yt2mp3.bat`].

`--merge-output-format` was helpful, but I forgot why (I believe it was needed for watching the movie on android):
code {
youtube-dl --merge-output-format mp4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=........
code }

}

{ Linux

code {
sudo apt-get install youtube-dl
code }

}
{ ffmpeg

  Apparently, for some (all?) movies, there's a dependency on tools/ffmpeg (or aconv):
  "
    WARNING: XnlT3rPNUp0: writing DASH m4a. Only some players support this container. Install ffmpeg or avconv to fix this automatically.
    ERROR: ffprobe/avprobe and ffmpeg/avconv not found. Please install one.
  "

  It seems that the necessary executables are found in → tools/ImageMagick.

}

sa:
  Config files in → Linux/fhs/home/username/_config/youtube-dl/config and
  → Linux/fhs/etc/youtube-dl_conf.
