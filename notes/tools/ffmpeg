The following extracted the part from 00:48 through 02:39. If this is the canonical way? I don't know.
code {
ffmpeg -i inputfile.mp4 -ss 00:00:48 -to 00:02:39 -async 1 -strict -2 outputfile.mp4

{ Compiling ffmpeg under Cygwin 64

  Based on → http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2014/01/1-technical-series-how-to-compile-ffmpeg-under-cygwin.html/[How to compile ffmpeg] under
  → development/Cygwin, I was able to compile ffmpeg (plus libmp3lame) for Cygwin 64 like so:
  -
  First, I had to compile ~libmp3lame~
  -
  The `configure.guess` script (apparantly dating back to 2003) had to be replaced by 
  → http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD

  As per → https://github.com/HPCE/hpce-2015-cw2/issues/3, the lines 138 and 139 in `frontend/lametime.c` had to be commented:
code {
       //#elif defined __CYGWIN__
       //    setmode(fileno(fp), _O_BINARY);
code }

Then, with the usuale `./configure`, `make`, `make install` trilogy, libmp3lame could be built and installed.

After that, ffmpeg could be build:

code {
→ development/Cygwin#apt-cyg install binutils, gcc-core, git, make, ming, mingw64-x86_64-runtime, yasm, texi2html, diffutils, dos2unix
git clone git://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
→ Linux/shell/commands/dos2unix configure
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-libmp3lame
make
make install
code }

}
