$ Google Earth kml: no annoying directions in point-placemarks

Google Earth, by default, renders a → tools/Google-Earth/kml/elements/Point[`<Point>`] with a *Balloon* with *Direction* links.
-
When using a `<description>` with a `<BalloonStyle>`, the annoying *Direction* link can be removed.

This is demonstrated with the following kml example which has two `<Placemark>` (`<Point> respectively) tags. One uses the `<styleUrl>` tag to reference a `<BalloonStyle>` that explicitely doesn't have the *Directions* link.
The other does not reference the `<BalloonStyle>`, thus, the *Directions* are implicitely added to the balloon-text.

When rendered, the balloons look like:
