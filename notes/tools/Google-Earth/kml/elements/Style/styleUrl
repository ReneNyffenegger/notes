$ kml: styleUrl

When a → tools/Google-Earth/kml/elements/Style[`<Style>`] is defined with an `id`,  this id can be referred to within a `<styleUrl>` tag. Thus, it is possible to apply the same
style to various *Geomotry* objects.

The following example has *one* `<LineStyle`> whose id is `tq84-style`. This line style defines the color and the width for a line. The three lines (`<Placemark>…</Placemark>`) 
refer to this style and consequently look alike.
