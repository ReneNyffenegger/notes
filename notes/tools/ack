ack is a → Linux/shell/commands/grep like tool, optimized for programmers.

Apparently, ack is installed on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install ack-grep`.

{ Interesting flags

  `-i`: Ignore case

  `-l`: Print filename if match found

  `--ignore-dir=DIR` and `--noignore-dir=DIR`: ignore or add directories to search

  `--type=TYPE`: Search for file type (for example if TYPE is `cpp`, it searches *.cpp .cc .cxx .m .hpp .hh .h .hxx*, see `ack --help-types` for more details)
