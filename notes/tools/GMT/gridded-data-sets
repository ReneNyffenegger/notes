A *gridded data set* is a table (with y rows and x columns) of values. The x and y might be latitude and longitude. The values might be the elevation at a
specific coordinate pair (x,y).

Gridded data sets are stored in → Wissenschaft/misc/NetCDF[netCDF] format.

The contents of such a netCDF file can be checked with → tools/GMT/programs/grdinfo.
