$ GMT: CPT files

CPT = Color Palette Tables

A CPT file determines with what color a specific z value shuld be colored, for example in → tools/GMT/programs/grdimage.


cpt files can be created with → tools/GMT/programs/makecpt,
→ tools/GMT/programs/grd2cpt or »manually« (for example using → development/languages/awk[awk] etc).

The cpt file is discussed in detail in the GMT Technical Reference and Cookbook, Chapter 4.
