`-B`

`-K`: Omit postscript trailer (don't finalize post script plot). (See → #ko)

`-O`: Omit postscript header (Overlay plot mode: append to existing post script plot). (See → #ko)

`-P`: Use *portrait* plot orientation

`-R`:

{ -K and -O #ko

The first PS producing command is to emit a postscript header, so `-O` is not used.
It also must not emit a post script trailer, so `-K` is used, too

The subsequent PS producing commands except the very last one are neither to produce a PS header nor trailer, so
they are given `-K` as well as `-O`.

The last PS producing command is to emit the PS trailer, so `-K` is not used anymore.

This results in such a sequence:
code {
psCommand ... -K      >  plot.ps
psCommand ... -K -O   >> plot.ps
...
psCommand ... -K -O   >> plot.ps
psCommand ...    -O   >> plot.ps
code }

}
