{ Mirroring from one server to another

  lftp is useful because it has a `mirror` command to download or update a whole directory tree.
  With `-R`, this mirror mechanism is reversed: it uploads or updates a directory tree on a server.


  { Local files to remote ftp server

  The following mirrors the tree structure under the local *current directory* to the remote current directory (which, after `cd` is
  `httpdocs/path/to/directory`).

  The `-R` stands for reverse so that files are put rather than get.

code {
$ lftp ftp.host.xyz
cd httpdocs/path/to/directory
mirror -R
code }

  }
