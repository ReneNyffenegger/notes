Vulkanen zusammen mit → Wissenschaft/Geologie/Magma wieder ausgespieen wird.

    The initiation of subduction remains one of the unresolved challenges of plate tectonics.
  " [The Initiation of Subduction: Criticality by Addition of Water?” Science, Vol. 294, 19 October 2001, p. 578.]

  "
    In spite of its importance, it is unclear how subduction is initiated.
  " [Robert J. Stern, “Subduction Initiation: Spontaneous and Induced,” Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Vol. 226, 2004, p. 275]


  "
    Cloos and Saunders et al. have shown that large oceanic plateaus cannot be subducted. Such thick plateaus resist subduction, jam the trench and accrete to the arc.”

  "
    It is disturbing that the proposed, exceedingly large differential
    movements between continents and ocean basins (especially where much
    unconsolidated sediment is involved) are not obvious. ... The present
    simple continental-margin model diagrammed with essentially rigid slabs
    does not relate well to observational data, and its value as a framework
    for interpreting observed structures of the continental margin is
    diminished by the large gap between theory and observation.” Roland von
    Huene, “Structure of the Continental Margin and Tectonism at the Eastern
    Aleutian Trench
  " [ Geological Society of America Bulletin, Vol. 83, December 1972, p. 3625.]
