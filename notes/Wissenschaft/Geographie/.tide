tide:
  • variation of sea level at coastal locations
  • deformation of land and water of the earth due to the gravitational forces of the moon and sun 

{ Semidurinal tide cycle:

  One tide occurs when the moon is overhead.
  
  Another occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of the earth (»antipodal tide«)

}
{ Real forces

  Real forces are those forces acting on a body due to other material objects:
  gravitation, electric attraction and repulsion, magnetic forces, contact
  forces (deformation from contact, and also forces due to friction and rolling
  resistance). 

}
{ Centripedal force

  Centripetal force is defined to be the radial component of the net force on a
  body when the body's position is represented in a polar coordinate system.

  It is just a label to distinguish the radial component from the tangential component of the net force.

  Centripetal force, being a component of the net force on a body, is a "real" force.

{ Centrifugal force

  Centrifugal force is a fictitious force used to simplify […] calculations.
