  At one period space is a plenum, full of vortices or their equivalent: at a
  later time it is empty: then it is the seat of electric and magnetic forces:
  next it is an aether: under Einsteinâ€™s influence it becomes curved; the
  quantum theoreticians now load it full with zero-point vibrations and
  oscillators.
