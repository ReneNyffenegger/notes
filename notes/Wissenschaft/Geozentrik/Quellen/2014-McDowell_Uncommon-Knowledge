  "
   When we accept what we are told without question, we are aubmitting to control by others. It is not the teacher,
   but the student, who is responsible for what the student learns. This book is addressed to those
   who think for themselves. It si for you to question, modify, and extend the uncommon knowledge presented here
   in your won search for truth.
  " [ S. 3 ]
