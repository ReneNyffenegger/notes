$ Newton-Machian analysis of Neo-tychonian model of planetary motion
by: → Wissenschaft/Geozentrik/Personen/Luka-Popov


In diesem Papier zeigt Popov mittels des *Machschen Prinzips*, dass die Beobachtung tägliche und jährliche Bewegung
der Erde auch mit einer täglichen und jährlichen Rotation des Universums um eine stationäre Erde herum erklärt werden kann.

    The analysis of planetary motions has been performed in the
    Newtonian framework with the assumption of Mach’s principle.
    The kinematical equivalence of the Copernican (heliocentric)
    and the Neo-tychonian (geocentric) systems is shown to be a
    consequence of the presence of pseudo-potential in the
    geocentric system, which, according to Mach, must be regarded
    as the real potential originating from the fact of the simultaneous
    acceleration of the Universe. This analysis can be done on any
    other celestial body observed from the Earth. Since Sun and
    Mars are chosen arbitrarily, and there is nothing special about
    Mars, one can expect to come up with the same general
    conclusion. There is another interesting remark that follows from
    this analysis. If one could put the whole Universe in accelerated
    motion around the Earth, the pseudo-potential corresponding to
    pseudo-force will immediately be generated. That same
    pseudo-potential causes the Universe to stay in that very state of
    motion, without any need of exterior forces acting on it.
