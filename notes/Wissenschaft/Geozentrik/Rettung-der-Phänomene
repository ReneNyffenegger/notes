  Edwin Hubble:
  "
     Such a condition would imply that we occupy a unique position in the universe,
     analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central earth. The
     hypothesis cannot be disproved but it is unwelcome and would be accepted
     only as a last resort in order to ~save the phenomena~. Therefore, we
     disregard this possibility and consider the alternative, namely, a
     distribution which thins out with distance.
