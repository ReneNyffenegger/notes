Thomas Paine schreibt in *The Age of Reason*
"
  Such a circumstance could not have happened without
  being known all over the world. One half would have wondered why the sun did not rise, and the other why it
  did not set; and the tradition of it would be universal; whereas there is not a nation in the world that knows
  anything about it.
