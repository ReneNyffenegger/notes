    The Earth is indeed the center of the Universe. The arrangement of quasars on
    certain spherical shells is only with respect to the Earth. These shells would disappear
    if viewed from another galaxy or a quasar. This means that the cosmological principle
    will have to go. Also, it implies that a coordinate system fixed to the Earth will be a
    preferred frame of reference in the Universe. Consequently, both the Special and the
    General Theory of Relativity must be abandoned for cosmological purposes
