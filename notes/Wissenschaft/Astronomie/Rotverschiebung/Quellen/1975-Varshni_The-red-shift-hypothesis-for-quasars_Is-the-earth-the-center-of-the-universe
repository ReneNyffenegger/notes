  " Some of the possibilities that we shall consider to accomodate this result
    may be disturbing, but we must consider these possibilities dispassionately.

    (3) *The Earth is indeed the center of the Universe*. The arrangement of quasars on
    certain spherical shells is only with respect to the Earth. These shells would disappear
    if viewed from another galaxy or a quasar. This means that the cosmological principle
    will have to go. Also, it implies that a coordinate system fixed to the Earth will be a
    preferred frame of reference in the Universe. Consequently, both the Special and the
    General Theory of Relativity must be abandoned for cosmological purposes
  " [ S. 6 ]

   *We are essentially left with only one possibility - No. 3* in the cosmological red-shift
   interpretation. However, before we accept such an *unaesthetic possibility*, we must
   raise the question: Are the 'red shifts' real? We wish to point out that we have pro-
   posed an alternative explanation of the spectra of quasars (Varshni, 1973, 1974, 1975;
   Menzel, 1970; Varshni and Lam, 1974) which is based on sound physical principles,
   does not require any red shifts, and has no basic difficulty
