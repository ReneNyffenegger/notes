{ Installing Stellarium

  Apparently, on → Windows, Stellarium can be installed with → Windows/Chocolatey:
code {
→ Windows/dirs/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/choco_exe[choco] install stellarium
code }

  Apparently, there is no script directory in the → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/installation/directories#stellarium-user-data-directory[user data directory] after installing
  Stellarium. So, create it manually:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/item/new[new-item] -type directory $env:→ Windows/development/environment-variables/APPDATA[appdata]/Stellarium/scripts
code }

  { After installing Stellarium

    Note to self: Untick *Load at startup* for the Oculars → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/GUI/popups/Configuration#stellarium-Configuration-Plugins[Plugin].

  }

{ Useful (imho) keyboard shortcuts #stellarium-shortcut

  A complete list of keyboard shortcut keys is displayed when pressing `F1`.
  -
 `F7` seems to allow assign different shortcut keys to different actions.

  { Show/hide

    The following keys toggle the display of specific objects or ideas in the sky (or on Earth)
    table { ll

      `d`, `p`, `s`, `g` ☰ deep sky objects, planets, stars, ground
      `v` and `r`, resp. ☰ labels and arts of constellations, resp.
      `e` and `z`, resp. ☰ Equatorial or azimutal *grid*, resp.
      `.` `,` and `h`, resp. ☰ Equator, ecliptic, horizon line, resp.

    table }

   `alt-p` toggles if planet and their moon names are shown. It seems to correspond to the → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/script/API[script API] function `SolarSystem.setFlagLabels`.

   `shift-t` toggles the display of planet (and moons? minor bodies?) trails.


  }
  { Time related

    table { ll
      `7` ☰ stop time
      `8` ☰ travel to *now*
      `[`, `]` ☰ backward, forward a week
      `j`, `l` ☰ move backwards, forwards (can be pressed multiple times to increase speed.)
      `k` ☰ move forward?
      `=` , `alt+=` ☰ forward a solar day, sidereal day

    table }

  }
  { Function keys

    table { ll

      `F1`  ☰ Help
      `F2`  ☰ → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/GUI/popups/Configuration[Configuration]
      `F3`  ☰ Search window (also `ctrl+f`)
      `F4`  ☰ Sky and viewing options
      `F5`  ☰ Enter Date/time (where it is almost impossible to enter a date or time with the keyboard!)
      `F6`  ☰ Location
      `F11` ☰ Full Screen on/off
      `F12` ☰ → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/script/console[Script console]

    table }

  }
  { TODO

    A selected object is deselected with `ctrl-space`.
  }

}
{ Modifying keyboard shortcuts #stellarium-modify-shortcuts

  Keyboard shortcuts can be modifed in the → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/installation/directories/config_ini[`config.ini`] file in the `[shortcuts]` section. The following example assigns `j` to the resume script action. Because this key
  is assigned to *decrease time speed* by default, `actionDecrease_Time_Speed` needs to be set to `""` explicitely.

  It is unclear to me what the `""` after the `J` stands for or is needed for.

code {
[shortcuts]
…
actionDecrease_Time_Speed              =  ""
actionResume_Script                    = J ""
…
code }

  Note, in the *keyboard shortcut assignment dialog* (`F7`), *Resume script execution* (`actionResume_Script`) is found under *Date and Time*.

  { TODO

    Can return be assigned to `actionResume_Script`:
code {
actionResume_Script                    = Return
code }

  }

}
{ Placing the observer anywhere in the Solar System

  It seems that is not possible to place the observer at an arbitrary place in the Solar System (or any other location for that matter) with Stellarium.

  This feature seems possible with → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Celestia, another open source software.
