{ Useful (imho) keyboard shortcuts #stellarium-shortcut

  A complete list of keyboard shortcut keys is displayed when pressing `F1`.
  -
 `F7` seems to allow assign different shortcut keys to different actions.

  { Show/hide

    The following keys toggle the display of specific objects or ideas in the sky (or on Earth)
    table { ll

      `d` ☰ deep sky objects
      `p` ☰ planets
      `s` ☰ stars
      `g` ☰ ground
      `v` and `r`, resp. ☰ labels and arts of constellations, resp.
      `e` and `z`, resp. ☰ Equatorial or azimutal *grid*, resp.
      `.` `,` and `h`, resp. ☰ Equator, ecliptic, horizon line, resp.

    table }

  }
  { Function keys

    table { ll

      `F1`  ☰ Help
      `F2`  ☰ Configuration
      `F3`  ☰ Search window (also `ctrl+f`)
      `F4`  ☰ Sky and viewing options
      `F5`  ☰ Date/time
      `F6`  ☰ Location
      `F12` ☰ → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/script/console[Script console]

    table }

  }

{ Modifying keyboard shortcuts

  Keyboard shortcuts can bemodifed in the `config.ini` file in the `[shortcuts]` section. The following example assigns `j` to the resume script action. It is unclear to me what the `""` stands for or is needed for
code {
[shortcuts]
…
actionResume_Script                    = J ""
…
code }

  { TODO

    Can return be assigned to `actionResume_Script`:
code {
actionResume_Script                    = Return
code }

  }

{ Placing the observer anywhere in the Solar System

  It seems that is not possible to place the observer at an arbitrary place in the Solar System (or any other location for that matter) with Stellarium.

  This feature seems possible with → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Celestia, another open source software.
