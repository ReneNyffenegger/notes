$ Stellarium popup: Configuration -> Plugins

{ Angle Measure

  *Angle Measure* allows to measure the angular distance between two points on the sky.

  By default, *Angle Measure* is «started» with `ctrl-A`. Howerver, this shortcut key seems to be occupied by two other functionalies. Thus, these two functions need to removed from the assignment to `ctrl-a` by pressing *F7*. 
  I can solve with F7…

{ Oculars #config-plugin-ocular

  By default, Stellarium displays a distracting *ocular box* in the top right corner of → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium.

  This can be turned of by un-setting automated loading of Oculars:
  Keyboard shurtcut key *F2*, then *Plugins*, then untick *Load at startup*.
