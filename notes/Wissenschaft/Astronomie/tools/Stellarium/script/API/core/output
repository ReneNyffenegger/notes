$ Stellarium API: core.output

`core.output(message)` writes `message` to a file named `output.txt` in → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium/installation/directories#stellarium-user-data-directory[Stellarium's user data] directory.

It seems that `core.saveOutputAs()` flushes the output written so far to the indicated file. However, in my experiments, I found that the path of the indicated file is not respected so that
the file ends up in the user data directory as well.
