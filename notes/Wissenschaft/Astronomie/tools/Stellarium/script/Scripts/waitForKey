$ Stellarium script: wait for pressing a key

This → Wissenschaft/Astronomie/tools/Stellarium script is a hack that tries to demonstrate how a Stellarium-Presentation can be stopped until the user presses one of the following
keys: `=`, `-`, `]` or `[`.
-
These keys change the Stellarium-time. If the function `waitForKey()` detects such a change in time, it realizes that one of these keys was pressed and returns to the caller.
