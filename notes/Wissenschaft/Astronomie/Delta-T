"
 [Delta-T] is a measure of the cumulative effect of the departure of the Earth's
  rotation period from the fixed-length day of atomic time. Formally it is
  the time difference obtained by subtracting Universal Time (UT, defined by
  the Earth's rotation) from Terrestrial Time (TT, independent of the Earth's
  rotation): ΔT = TT − UT
  The value of ΔT for the start of 1902 was approximately zero; for 2002 it was
  about 64 seconds. So the Earth's rotations over that century took about 64
  seconds longer than would be required for days of atomic time.
