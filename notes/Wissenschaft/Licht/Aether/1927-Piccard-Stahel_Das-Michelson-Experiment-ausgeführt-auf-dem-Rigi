Das Michelson Experiment ausgeführt auf dem Rigi, 1800 M. ü. M.

→ Wissenschaft/Personen/Dayton-Miller schreibt über dieses Experiment:
"
  In three of the four [negative] experiments, the interferometers have
  been enclosed in heavy, sealed metal housings and also have been
  located in basement rooms in the interior of heavy buildings and
  below the level of the ground; in the experiment of Piccard and Stahel …,
  a metal vacuum chamber was used … If the question of an entrained ether is
  involved in the investigation, it would seem that such massive and opque
  shielding is not justifiable. The experiment is designed to
  detect a very minute effect on the velocity olight, to be impressed
  upon the light through the ether itself, and it would seem to e essential that
  there should be the least possible obstruction between the free ether and
  the light path in the interferometer …
