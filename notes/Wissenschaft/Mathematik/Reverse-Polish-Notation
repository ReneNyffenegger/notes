Invented by Jan Lukasiewicz (1878-1956).

No brackets ( `(` and `)` ) needed to formulate mathematical expressions because operators are placed after rather than
between the operands.

RPN was used in the traditional HP scientific calculators and is still used in → development/languages/PostScript.

{ Examples

  Traditional: `a*(b+c)`
  -
  RPN: `a b c + *`

  Traditional: `(a-b) * (c+d) / e`
  -
  RPN `a b - c d + * e /`

  Traditional: `2 * sin (a - b)`
  -
  RPN: `2 a b - sin *`

}
