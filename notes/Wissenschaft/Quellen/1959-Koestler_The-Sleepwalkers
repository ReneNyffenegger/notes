sub: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe


Richard Pogge über *The Sleepwalkers*:
"
  Koestler's book is interesting if opinionated, and I do not agree with all of his ideas (in particular, I have issues with his rough treatment of
  → Wissenschaft/Geozentrik/Personen/Galileo-Galilei[Galileo],
  and his belief that Kepler's work proves his [Koestler's] ideas about of the essential role of the irrational in scientific discourse). Despite this,
  it is provocative and interesting reading.
