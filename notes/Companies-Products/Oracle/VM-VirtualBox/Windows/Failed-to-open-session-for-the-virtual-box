The error message *Failed to open a session for the virtual machine…* is possible caused if the → Windows/optional-features/Hyper-V[Windows feature Hyper-V] is enabled.

I was able to solve this error by disabling this feature. In PowerShell, this was possible with
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/windowsOptionalFeature/disable[disable-windowsOptionalFeature] -online -featureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
code }

This command also disabled
  • Microsoft-Hyper-V
  • Microsoft-Hyper-V-Tools-All
  • Microsoft-Hyper-V-Management-PowerShell
  • Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor
  • Microsoft-Hyper-V-Services
  • Microsoft-Hyper-V-Management-Clients
