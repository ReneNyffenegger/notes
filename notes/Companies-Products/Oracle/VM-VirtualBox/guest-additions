$ Oracle VirtualBox Guest Additions

*Guest additions* improve the guest operating system (notably: screen resolution and mouse control). In particular, they come with the following features:
  • Mouse pointer integration (which, if the guest OS supports it, makes the → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox/host-key obsolete)
  • → Companies-Products/Oracle/VM-VirtualBox/virtual-machine/settings/shared-folder[Shared folders] (to share files between the guest and the host)
  • Better video support
  • Seamless windows (map windows on the VM's desktop onto the host's desktop; press `ctrl+L` to switch to seamless windows)
  • Generic host/guess communication channels
  • Time synchronization
  • Shared clipboard
  • Automated logins (aka credential passing)

Guest additions are installed *within* the guest OS, not on the host OS.

Guest additions technically consist of device drivers and system applications.

{ Telling if guest additions are installed
  
  Hostkey + `n` opens *session information* whose *Runtime Information* tab lists the Runtime Attribute *Guest Addtions* along with its
  version number. The version number is reported as *Not Detected* if they're not installed.
    
  In a Windows guest, the following PowerShell command might be used:
code {
→ Windows/PowerShell/command-inventory/noun/service/get *vbox*
code }
  
  In a Unix guest, the following command allows to verify if guest additions were installed:
code {
→ Linux/shell/commands/lsmod | → Linux/shell/commands/grep -i vbox
code }

  On the host, the command → Windows/dirs/Program-Files/Oracle/VirtualBox/VBoxManage_exe/showvminfo[`VBoxManage showvminfo $vmname`] prints some guest addtions related information
  under the sections *Guest* and *Guest Facilities*.
