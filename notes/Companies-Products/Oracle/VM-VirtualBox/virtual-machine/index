{ Machine folder

  Each virtual machine is associated with a (file system) directory which stores all files for that virtual machine.

  These files are
    • An → development/XML file that describes the virtual machine's *characteristics. The extension of this file is `.vbox`.
    • The virtual hard disk which are typically represented by disk images such as those in the VDI format.

  The default location for machine folders seems to be `→ Windows/dirs/Users/username[%USERPROFILE%]\VirtualBox VMs` on → Windows and
  `$HOME/VirtualBox VMs` on → Linux.
