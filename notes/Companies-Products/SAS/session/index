{ Starting a session #sas-session-start

  SAS assigns a → Companies-Products/SAS/library/work[work library].

  The → Companies-Products/SAS/library/sashelp library is made available. Its views and tables contain
  metadata on the session.

  The → Companies-Products/SAS/library/sasuser[sasuser library] is checked for a
  → Companies-Products/SAS/catalog/profile[profile catalog]


  The → Companies-Products/SAS/autoexec_sas file is executed.

  Apparently, when the session is started, a `sas.lck` file is created in this work directory

}
{ Terminating a session

  The work library is cleaned up (except when a SAS session crashes, in which case the work directory should be manually cleaned up).

}

  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/recover-interactive-session[Recovering an interactive session]

  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/presenv[Option `presenv`] and
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/presenv[`proc presenv`] to preserve some settings across sessions.
