$ SAS: session
@ session

{ Work library

  Usually, SAS assigns a → Companies-Products/SAS/library/work[work library] for each session.

  Apparently, when the session is started, a `sas.lck` file is created in this work directory

}
sa:
  → Companies-Products/SAS/session/utf-8

  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/recover-interactive-session[Recoering an interactive session]
