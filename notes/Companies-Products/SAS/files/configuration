$ SAS configuration files
@ configuration files

A configuration file might be used to set SAS → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options[options].

{ Location of configuration files

  Configuration files might be stored in different locations.

  When a session starts, SAS tries to read the configuration files in sequence from the following directories:
    • → Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x[!SASROOT]/sasv9.cfg
    • → Linux/fhs/usr/local/SAS/SASFoundation/9_x[!SASROOT]/sasv9_local.cfg
    • → Linux/fhs/home/username/_sasv9_cfg (With leading dot)
    • → Linux/fhs/home/username/[~/sasv9.cfg] (Without leading dot)
    • `sasv9.cfg` in the current directory
    • restricted configuration files

  These configuration files, except the restricted ones, are skipped when an explicit configuration file is indicated with either
    • `$ sas -config my-configfile.cfg`
    • `export SASV9_OPTIONS='-config my-configfile.cfg`
    • `export SASV9_CONFIG=my-configfile.cfg`

  The configuration files that were actually used when the system and/or session started can be shown with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/options#proc-options-config[config] system options.
