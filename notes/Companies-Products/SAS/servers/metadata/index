$ SAS: Metadata server
@ Metadata Server

A metadata server is a centralized repository that stores, manages and delivers → development/Data/metadata for SAS applications within an organization.
-
Because it's a central instance, all users can benefit from consistent data.

The Metadata Serer uses the *SAS Open Metadata Architecture* and the *Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM)*.

{ Metadata objects

  A metadata object describes a *resource* (such as a report) by assigning values to certain attributes.

  A metadata server can store objects such as
    • users (→ Companies-Products/SAS/users#sas-identities)
    • user groups
    • data libraries
    • tables
    • jobs
    • cubes
    • documents
    • information maps
    • reports
    • stored processes
    • dashboards
    • analytical models
    • SAS Workspace Servers
    • SAS Stored Process Servers
    • SAS OLAP Servers

  With such metadata, it's also possible to control who (which user) can access what data.

}
{ API

  There's an API to the Metadata Server so that third parties can write applications to access the Metadata Server.

}
{ Managing the metadata server

  The metadata server can be managed with the ~SAS Management Console~.
