$ SAS users

{ SAS identities #sas-identities

  It is recommended to create an *SAS identity* for each user who uses the SAS environment.

  Thus, it is possible to grant different rights on different objects to different users.

  SAS identities are stored in the â†’ Companies-Products/SAS/servers/metadata[metadata server].
