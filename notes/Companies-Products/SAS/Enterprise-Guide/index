  { Projects

    A project is a record of
      • the data sets that have been opened,
      • the tasks that have been run,
      • the results that have been produced and
      • the relationship between these objects.

    In SAS Enterprise Guide, one project is opened at a time.

    A project can either be represented as a *tree structure* in the project explorer or
    as a *process flow* in the project designer.

    { EGP files

      `*.egp` files are enterprise guide project files.

    }
  }

  { Running programs in batch

    Apparently, *File->Schedule Project* creates a VB Script file and adds a scheduled task to the Windows scheduler.
