$ SAS log
@ log

SAS writes information, warning and error messages into the log.
-
By default, text of → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/put[put statements] and
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/statements/put[%put macro statements] is written into the log as well. This
can be changed with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/file[file statement].

Note: the *SAS logging facility* is different logging system.
