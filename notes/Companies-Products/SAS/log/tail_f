$ SAS log: tail -f

In order to constantly view the → Companies-Products/SAS/log[log] with → Linux/shell/commands/tail#tail-f[`tail -f`], the log file must be unbuffered.
Apparently, the default seems to be buffered. This can be changed with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/unbuflog option. However this option is set(?) at
start up of SAS.
-
So, the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/logparm option must be set to `write=immediate`. Since `logparm` also cannot be changed dynamically, it needs to
be set in a → Companies-Products/SAS/files/configuration[configuration file], possibly in
→ Linux/fhs/home/username/_sasv9_cfg:
code {
-→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/logparm[logparm] "write=immediate"
code }

If → Companies-Products/SAS/Enterprise-Guide is used, the log file might be redirected with → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/printto[`proc printto`].

It is advisable to set → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/pagesize[`pagesize=max`] in order to suppress the page breaks which make it quite impoosible to look at the log file with `tail -f`.

sa:
  The Perl script → Companies-Products/SAS/helpers/highlight-sas-log_pl to highlight a log file.
