{ Macro %library_info

  The following *simple* → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros[macro] gets the data from sashelp.vlibnam to print some
  information about a → Companies-Products/SAS/library.

  It is executed with the (uppercase) name of a library: `%library_info(TQ84_LIB)` (assuming that TQ84_LIB is the name of a library).
