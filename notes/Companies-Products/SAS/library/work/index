$ SAS: work
@ work

SAS assigns a work libarary for each → Companies-Products/SAS/session[session]. 

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options[Options] related to the work library are:
  • `user`
  • `work`
  • `(no)workterm`
  • `(no)workinit`

{ Default library

  Work is the default library that is used for *one level names*.

  This behavior can be overridden with the → Companies-Products/SAS/library/user library.

}
{ sas.lck #sas-work-sas-lck

  Apparently, when a → Companies-Products/SAS/session[session] is started, SAS creates a `sas.lck` file in the
  work directory
