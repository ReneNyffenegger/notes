Work is the default library. It is usually assigned by SAS for each → Companies-Products/SAS/session[session].

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options[Options] related to the work library are:
  • `user`
  • `work`
  • `(no)workterm`
  • `(no)workinit`

{ sas.lck #sas-work-sas-lck

  Apparently, when a → Companies-Products/SAS/session[session] is started, SAS creates a `sas.lck` file in the
  work directory
