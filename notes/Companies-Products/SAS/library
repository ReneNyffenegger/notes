@ library

A library is a collection of one or more → Companies-Products/SAS/files[SAS files]. The files are sometimes referred to as *members*.

All members except → Companies-Products/SAS/files/catalog[catalogs] can be password protected.

{ WORK #work

  Work is the default library. It is usually assigned by SAS for each → Companies-Products/SAS/session[session].

  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options[Options] related to the work library are:
    • `user`
    • `work`
    • `(no)workterm`
    • `(no)workinit`

}
{ Engines

  A library is associated with an engine.
  
  The engine is a piece of software that is able to read and write the data in the library's members.

{ Dictionary tables

  With the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/dictionary, it's possible to → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/dictionary/members#lib-select-members[select the members of a library].

}
{ Autocall #sas-autocall-library

  An autocall library is an operating system directory in which each file contains a macro.

  The name of the file must correspond to the name of the macro that it defines. On Windows, the files additionally require a `.sas` extension.

  The locations of autocall directores is specified with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/sasautos[sasautos option].

  Apparently, the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/mautosource[mautosource option] needs to be set for autocalls to work.
