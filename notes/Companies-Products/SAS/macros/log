{ redirectLog #sas-macro-redirectLog

  `%tq84_redirectLog` uses → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/printto[`proc printto`] to redirect the output of the
  → Companies-Products/SAS/log[log file] and procedure output.
  -
  I especially needed this functionality when working with → Companies-Products/SAS/Enterprise-Guide.

  The width of the output is set to the maximum of 256 characters.

  The filename looks like `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-PID` (PID is the process identifier as identified with → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables/automatic/sysjobid[`&sysobjid`].

  In order for the log file to be immediatly flushed, the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/logparm option
  should be set to `write=immediate` in a → Companies-Products/SAS/files/configuration[config file].
