$ Using vim/gvim with SAS

It's possible to use → development/vim/[Vim] to write statements for execution in -> Companies-Products/SAS

An empty file needs to be created. This files will be → Linux/shell/commands/tail[tail'ed] to the sas executable.
-
The `> $filename` construct empties an existing file or creates a new one.
code {
$ > /share/home/tq84/sas/sas.redir
code }

The sas executable is stared. It takes the input from the `sas.redir` file:
code {
$ tail -f /share/home/tq84/sas/sas.redir | /usr/app/sas/config/Lev1/SASApp_01/sas.sh -nodms -noterminal
code }

The log file is `tail'ed` into the perl script → Companies-Products/SAS/helpers/highlight-sas-log_pl[highlight-sas-log.pl` to highlight it.
code {
$ tail -f -n 100 /share/home/tq84/sas/sas.log | highlight-sas-log.pl
code }

Finally, vim or gvim is started:
code {
$ vim /share/home/tq84/sas/stmts.sas
code }

From vim, the statements to be executed in sas by appending the statements to the `sas.redir` file. The statements to be executed need to be visually selected.
code {
:'<,'> w >> /share/home/tq84/sas/sas.redir
code }
