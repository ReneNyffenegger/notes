$ SAS data set
@ data set

A data set consists of data along with *descriptor information*.

A data set is somewhat analogous to a relational → development/databases/[database] table.


It is a → Companies-Products/SAS/files[SAS file] that is stored in an → Companies-Products/SAS/library[SAS library].

A data set is identifyed by `libref.filename`. If `libref` is ommited, SAS chooses `WORK` as default.

{ Descriptor information

  Information such as the data types and length of variables (attributes) etc.

}

{ Two types of data sets

  SAS knows two types of data sets: data files and data views.

}
{ Data files

  Data files are organized with SAS libraries.

}
{ Data view

  A data view stores the descriptor information and the observations in seperate places.

  Usually, a data view feels like a data file.

  There are three types of data views:
    • data step views
    • SAS/ACCESS views
    • PROC SQL views

}

{ PROC DATASET

  Information about data sets can be read and changed with `proc dataset`.
