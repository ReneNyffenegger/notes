$ SAS data set
@ data set

A data set consists of data along with *descriptor information*.

A data set is somewhat analogous to a relational → development/databases/[database] table.

Usually, a data set is built in a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step.

It is a → Companies-Products/SAS/files[SAS file] that is stored in an → Companies-Products/SAS/library[SAS library].

A data set is identifyed by `libref.filename`. If `libref` is ommited, SAS chooses `WORK` as default.

{ Descriptor information

  Information such as the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[data types] and length of variables (attributes) etc.

}

{ Two types of data sets

  SAS knows two types of data sets: data files and data views.

}
{ Data files

  Data files are organized with SAS libraries.

}
{ Data view

  A data view stores the descriptor information and the observations in seperate places.

  Usually, a data view feels like a data file.

  There are three types of data views:
    • data step views
    • SAS/ACCESS views
    • PROC SQL views

}

{ proc dataset

  Information about data sets can be read and changed with `proc dataset`.

}
{ Indexes

  Variables/attributes can be indexed on a data set. Indexes can then be used in
    • `where` statements in a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step[data steps] or → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/procedural-step[proc steps].
    • `by` statements in data or proc steps.
    • `key` option on a `set` or `modify` statement.
      
  Use `idxname` and `idxwhere` options to override default index usage.

  `options msglevel=i` prints index usage into the log.
