$ SAS ODS: html
@ ODS html

{ Empty

  Create an »empty« html document:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/ods/html/empty.sas||

}
{ Graphic files and the gpath and path options

  The `gpath` option of the `ods html` statement controls where the → Companies-Products/SAS/graphics/ODS[graphic files] are created.

  If `gpath` is not specified, the graphic files will be created in the same directory as specified with the `path=` option.

  If `file=` is not specified as well, the graphic files will be created in the default directory.

}
{ Graphics and option url

  If after creation of the html and graphics, the generated html file is moved to a different location, the option `url` must be set to `none`.

  The following example does not explictely specify a graphic destination path with `gpath`. The graphic will be created in the
  same directory as the html file.
  -
  In order to be able to move the created files around, `url=none` is used:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/ods/html/url/none.sas||

  This example uses the `gpath` option to specify a graphic path. The `url=` option is used to accomodate for the different path:
