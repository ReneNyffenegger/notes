$ SAS graphics

SAS has two systems to create graphics: → Companies-Products/SAS/graphics/GRAPH and → Companies-Products/SAS/graphics/ODS[ODS]

{ Differences between SAS/GRAPH and ODS

  ODS seems to be much easier to use but seems also to have much more restricted in the possibilities. (For example, to create an ods graphic
  is almost as simple as executing → Companies-Products/SAS/graphics/ODS/statements/graphic[`ods graphic on`] and then the desired
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc[`proc`]).

  
   The `goptions` statement controls the appearance of SAS/GRAPH graphs but has not effect on ODS graphs.

   With SAS/GRAPH, graphs are saved into graphic → Companies-Products/SAS/catalog[catalogs].
   -
   ODS creates png, jpeg etc files that can easily be viewed in a browser or image program.
