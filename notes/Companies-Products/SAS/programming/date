$ SAS: date

SAS dates are stored as numbers of days since January 1, 1960.

A time variable is independant of a date: it stores the number of seconds since midnight.

A date time variable stores both: a date and a time.

Data variables are valid for dates since 1582 (adoption of the â†’ Wissenschaft/misc/Bestimmung-von-Daten#gregorianischer-kalender[Gregorianic Calendar]).
