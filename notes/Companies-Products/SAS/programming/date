$ SAS: date

{ Dates are stored as numbers

  SAS dates are stored as numbers of days since January 1, 1960. So, January 1st, 1960 is actually the number 0, January 2nd 1960 the number 1, December 31st 1960 as 365 (leap year!).

}
{ Times are also stored as numbers

  A time variable is independant of a date: it stores the number of seconds since midnight. So, 0:01 AM is stored as 60, 1:00 AM as 3600, 10:00 AM as 36000 etc.

{ Date times

  A date time variable stores both: a date and a time.

  Data variables are valid for dates since 1582 (adoption of the → Wissenschaft/misc/Bestimmung-von-Daten#gregorianischer-kalender[Gregorianic Calendar]).
