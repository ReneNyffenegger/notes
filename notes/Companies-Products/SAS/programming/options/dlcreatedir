$ SAS option: dlcreatedir
@ dlcreatedir

With the option `dlcreatedir` set, a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/libname[libname] statement will create the directory if it does not exist.
-
However, it will only add one new level to the directory hierarchy, that is, it won't behave like a → Linux/shell/commands/mkdir#mkdir-p[`mkdir -p`] and add sub-subdirectories.
