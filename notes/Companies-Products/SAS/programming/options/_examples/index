$ SAS: examples using options

{ Saving and loading options with proc optsave/optload into/from the registry #sas-save-load-option-registry

  The following example uses → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/optsave to store the current set of → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options[option] values to the
  → Companies-Products/SAS/registry, then changes the value of the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/pagesize option,
  then loads the stored options and verifies if the option had been reverted back to the original value.

  Additionally, it uses → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/registry to view the subkey of the registry where the options were stored to.

{ Saving and loading options to/from a data set

  The following example is similar in spirit as the one above, yet instead of storing the option values into the registry,
  it stores the values into a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-sets[data set].
