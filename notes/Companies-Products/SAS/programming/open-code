$ SAS programming: open code
@ open code

Open code is everything outside of a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros[macro].

Open code is organized into steps (→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step[data steps] and proc steps). They are run in the order in which
they are found in the programm. (Exceptions to this rule are statements such as `title`, `options`, `ods` …)

Open code can be either programmed or created by → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros.
