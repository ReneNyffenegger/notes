{ Time of execution

  If the passed string is a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros[macro] invocation, the macro is executed immediatly.

  Other text, either passed directly or generated by a macro invocation is pushed onto the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/input-stack. Thus,
  the execution of such text is delayed until the current data step is finished.
