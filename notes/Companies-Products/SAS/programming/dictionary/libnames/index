{ Select

  The `dictionary.libnames` table doesn't seem to be normalized. A library can have multiple records:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/dictionary/libnames/select.sas||

}
{ Pivot

  Because the table has multiple records per libname, the following statement tries to create a pivot for the values:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/dictionary/libnames/pivot.sas||

}
