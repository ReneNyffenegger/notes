$ SAS programmring: global statements

In addition to the seperate languages of steps (→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step, → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/procedural-step),
SAS also offers *global statements*.
-
Global statemens can appear in and between any step. The influence the property of the global program rather than an individual step.
-
The execute as soon as the semicolon is reached. Their effect continues accross subsequent steps until their setting is overridden by a similar statement.
-
Therefore, it's arguably cleaner to place global statement between steps rather than inside them.

The most prominent examples of global statements are
  • `OPTIONS`
  • `LIBNAME`
  • `FILENAME`
  • `TITLE`
  • `FOOTNOTE`
