$ SAS: data step
@ data step

A data steps starts with `data` and optional *data set names*.

The data step is used to perform data manipulation:
an important purpose of the data step is to provide a means of reading external data and creating data sets for later use in procedures.


Names to avoid for data sets: `_NULL_`, `_DATA_`, `_LAST_`.

{ Implied Loop of a Data Step

  ILDS (Implied Loop of a Data Step): The data step performs an (implied) loop: for each observation, a set of statements is executed.

  The automatically created variable `_n_` stores the iteration number of the loop. 


}
{ Writing Output

  By default, on the last line of execution on the step, data is automatically written to a data set.

  This can be overridden with an `OUTPUT` statement somewhere in the data step.

  A `DELETE` statement returns to the start of the loop without writing any output.

  If the data step starts with `data _null_`, no output is written whatsoever.

}
{ Default naming of output data sets

  If the output data set is not explicitely named, SAS will name them `DATA1`, `DATA2`, `DATA3` …

}
{ Program Data Vector (PDV) #program-data-vector

  The PDV is a storage area for all named variables of a data step.
