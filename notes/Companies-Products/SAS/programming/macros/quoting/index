$ SAS: Macro quoting
@ macro quoting

Macro quoting is necessary to indicate to the macro processor that a special character is to interpreted as text rather than as a symbol of the macro language.

When text is quoted, the macro processor masks the special character with a so called *delta characters*: a *prefix* and a *suffix* delta character enclose the special character.
Additionally, the prefix delta character indicates the type of the quoting mechanism used.

  `nr` stands for *not resolved* (or *no rescan*?). These functions address the same characters like the functions without `nr`.
  expcept that they keep the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-processor[macro processor]
  from rescanning the result of the function. This is usefule when `&` or `%` need to be maintained.
  
  `b` functions can quote unbalanced paranthesis and unmatched quotation marks.
  
  

  Quoting functions can be categorized by
    • *when* they quote: at *compilation* time (*only* `%str` and `%nrstr`) or at *execution* time (for example `%bquote` and `%nrbquote`).
    • *what* they quote
