$ SAS: Macro quoting

Macro quoting is necessary to indicate to the macro processor that a special character is to interpreted as text rather than as a symbol of the macro language.

When text is quoted, the macro processor masks the special character with a so called *delta characters*: a *prefix* and a *suffix* delta character enclose the special character.
Additionally, the prefix delta character indicates the type of the quoting mechanism used.
