$ SAS macro variables: indirect reference (via ampersand ampersand ampersand)

{ One, two and three ampersands

  `&var_foo` resolves to the value of the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables[macro variable] named `var_foo`.
  
  in `&&var_foo`, `&&` first resolves to a single `&`, so `&&var_foo` also resolves to the value of `var_foo`.
  
  However, in `&&&var_foo`, the first two ampersands (`&&`) resolve to a single ampersand and the following `&var_foo` (as usual) resolves to the value of `var_foo`, resulting in `&var_value` which,
  if `var_foos_value` is set, to the value of `var_foos_value`.
  
  Thus, it's possible to reference another variable with three ampersands.
