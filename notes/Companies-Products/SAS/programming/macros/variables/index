$ SAS: macro variables
@ macro variables


Macro variables start with an ampersand (`&`).

A macro variable does not belong to a → Companies-Products/SAS/data-sources/data-set.

The → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[data type] of a macro variable is character up to 64'000 characters.

If a macro variable is defined in a macro, it's scope is local. If it is defined in → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/open-code, its scope is global.

Within single quotes, macro variables are not expanded.

Macro variables are defined with the `%let` macro statement:
code {
%let macro_variable=value;
code }

Within a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step, a macro variable can be created with
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/call-routines/symput.

The (value of) macro variables are stored in the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-symbol-table.

A macro variable's value is resolved when it reaches the top of the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/input-stack.
