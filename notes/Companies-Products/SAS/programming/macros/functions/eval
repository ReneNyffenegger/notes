$ SAS programming - macro function: %eval
@ %eval


{ Integer arithmetic

  `%eval` is only capable of integer arithmetic. For floating point arithmetic, → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/functions/sysevalf must be used:
  gh|about-SAS|/macro-processor/functions/eval/integer-arithmetic.sas||

  The → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/statements/if[`%if`] statement uses `%eval` to evaluate its condition. So, also an `%if` statement
  is incapable to perform something like `%if 6.3 + 2.1 > 4.9` (→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/statements/if#if-integer-arithmetic[See here]).
