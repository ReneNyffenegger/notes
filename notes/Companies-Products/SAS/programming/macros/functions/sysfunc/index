→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables[Macro variables] need/must not be quoted when used as argument to a function

{ putn #macro-sysfunc-putn


  The following example uses `%sysfunc` to call → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/putn in order to
  format a variable with a specific → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/formats-informats[format].

  `putn` is needed because → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/put is not available in the macro environment.
