$ SAS programming - macro statement: %let
@ %let

`%let` creates a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables[macro variable]. The value of the macro
variable is stored in the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-symbol-table.
-
Before the value of the macro variable goes into the symbol table, macro triggers (`&` and `%` are resolved or executed). That is macro functions (like `%upcase` or `%substr`) are evaluated first.
