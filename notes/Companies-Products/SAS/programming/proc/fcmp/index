`fcmp` is the function compiler. It allows to create user defined SAS functions.

}
{ Functions

  In order to return a value, a *function* rather than a procedure is needed.

  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/fcmp/max.sas||

  By default, the returned → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[data type] of a function
  is numeric. To change that, a `$` with an optional length is needed:

}
{ varargs

  Pass a variable number of arguments/parameters to the function.

}
{ run_macro

  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/fcmp/run_macro.sas||

  In order to use character parameters, it seems advisable to use → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/dequote[`dequote`] because
  apparently, SAS passes the parameters within quotes.
