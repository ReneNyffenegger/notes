$ SAS: proc report
@ proc report

`proc report` combines
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/freq,
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/means,
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/print,
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/sort,
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/tabulate and can do things for which normally
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/template is used.


{ Simple proc report example

gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/report/basic.sas||

}
{ define order

  The `define order` statement defines which column the report is ordered on:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/report/define/order.sas||

}
{ define group

  The `define / group` statement by itself is not very useful. It's usually combined with
  an `define / analysis` statement:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/report/define/group.sas||

}
{ define analysis

  With `define / analysis`, it's possible to create sums, averages, totals etc:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/report/define/analysis.sas||

}
{ define across

  `define / across` is used to create *pivot tables*:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/report/define/across.sas||

}
{ compute

  `compute` can be used to add addtional text before and after groups:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/report/compute/before-after.sas||

}
{ Using the list option #proc-report-list

  The `list` options directs `proc report` to print what it actually executes. This is useful, because `proc report` uses defaults
  for statements that are not explicitely stated:
