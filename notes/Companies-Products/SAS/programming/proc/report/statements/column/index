$ SAS - proc report - column statement

The `column` and the `by` statement defines which variables from the input → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-sets[data set] is used.
-
Variables that are not listed in the `column` and `by` statements are not used.
-
The variables can the also be used in the `compute` block.

For each variable, a respective → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/report/statements/define[define statement] should be used. If not,
sAS provides a default `define` statement.

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/report[`proc report`] can be run without `column` statement. In this case, SAS creates a default `column` statement
with the variables of the input data set.
