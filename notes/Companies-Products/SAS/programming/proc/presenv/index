$ SAS: proc presenv
@ proc presenv

Preserve the environment (→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/_global[global statements] and environment variables) for later restart.

`proc preserve` works in tandem with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/presenv[presenv option].


{ Simple example

  Before ending a → Companies-Products/SAS/session[session], `proc presenv` is executed so as to store
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/_global[global statements] etc:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/presenv/session-end.sas||

  After starting a session, the stored `session.sas` file is → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/statements/include[included] to restore
  the previous session:

  gh|about-SAS|/programming/proc/presenv/session-start.sas||

}
