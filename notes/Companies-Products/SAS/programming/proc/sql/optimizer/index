$ SAS: proc sql - optimizer
@ optimizer

The SQL optimizer analyzes submitted SQL statements and creates an *execution plan* (aka: run plan?). The goal of the optimizer is
to create the plan such that the query is run optimally (perforamance wise? ressource wise?).

The details of the execution plan can be examined with the
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/sql/_method[_method] and
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/sql/_tree[_tree] option.
