$ SAS: proc setinit
@ proc setinit

`proc setinit` can be used to find out which products (such as *SAS/GRAPH* or *SAS/STAT*) are licensed and when they expire.
-
Apparently, the proc is undocumented.

Having a product licensed doesn't necessarily mean that it is also installed. Use → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/product_status[`proc product_status`]
to verify if it is installed.
