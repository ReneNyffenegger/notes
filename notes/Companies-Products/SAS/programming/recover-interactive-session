$ SAS: recovering an interactive session

The following code snippet was found in
→ http://www.phusewiki.org/docs/2006/CS03.pdf[Lessons Learned: Valuable (But Hidden) SAS Details] (by
 Dante diTommaso and Benjamin Szilagyi).
 
It is supposed to recover from apparently unrecoverable errors such as unbalanced quotes, bad macro definitions etc.

Instead of terminating the SAS session and start from scratch, the snippet should be executed until it prints
`ERROR: Procedure SAVE_ME not found.`
-
Then, the session is recovered.

This piece of code closes any unmatched quote, open paranthesis, open comments and fragments of started macro definitions.
