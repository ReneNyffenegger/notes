$ SAS statements: infile
@ infile

The `infile` statement identifies an *external data file* or an *in-stream data* from which data should be read. With the `infile` statement, the
data is described in a way that it can be processed by SAS.

When SAS encounters the statement, it opens the file and creates the needed → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step#sas-input-buffer[input buffer].

code {
INFILE file-specification <option(s)>;
code }

The *file-specification* is either a *filename* (such as `/home/tq84/foo.dat`), a *fileref*, an *alias* or a *ddname*.

After opening the file, the data can be read with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/input[input statement].

{ Specifying the filename

  The filename of the file to be read can be specified with the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/infile statement:

  gh|about-SAS|/programming/statements/infile/filename.sas||

  Instead of a operating system path, a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/fileref can be used.
}

{ delimiter

  The default delimiters are spaces (blanks). The `delimiter` option (apparently abbreviated with `dlm`) changes
  the delimiter

{ dsd - delimiter sensitive data
