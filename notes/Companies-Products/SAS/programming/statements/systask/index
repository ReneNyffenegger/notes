$ SAS statements: systask

{ systask command

  Unlike the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/x[x statement], `systask` writes the output of a shell command
  to the → Companies-Products/SAS/log[log file].

  It seems that for ~redirection~ to work, the entire command (inclusive redirection) must be enclosed in something like
  `bash -c 'command > dest-file` or alternatively the `shell=…` parameter can be used.
