$ SAS statements: length
@ length

By default, SAS creates each → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables with a length of 8 bytes - longer character values are
then truncated. The `length` statement (in a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step[data step]?) specifies a different length.
