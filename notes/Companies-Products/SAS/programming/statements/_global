@ global statements

Global statements are not executed in program sequence. Rather, they take effect as soon as the
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation[compiler] parses them.

Some global statements are:
  • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/libname
  • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/filename
  • title
  • footnote

sa:
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/presenv[`proc presenv`] can be used to preserve global statements (and more) accross
  → Companies-Products/SAS/session[sessions].
