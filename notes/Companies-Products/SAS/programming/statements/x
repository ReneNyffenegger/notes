$ SAS statements: x
@ x

`x` executes an operating system command. It requires the option → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/xcmd[`xcmd`] to be set.


{ &sysrc

  Executing a command sets the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables/automatic[automatic variable]
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables/automatic/sysrc[`&sysrc`] to the command's `ERRORLEVEL`.

{ Capturing output

  Unfortunately, it seems that the output of the `x` statement cannot be captured and is not written to the Companies-Products/SAS/log[log file].

  So, in order to capture the output of an operating command, → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/filename/pipe could be used.
