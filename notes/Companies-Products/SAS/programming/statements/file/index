$ SAS statements: file
@ file

{ Change destination of put #change-put-dest

  By default, a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/put[put statement] writes
  into the → Companies-Products/SAS/log. The destination can be changed with
  the `file` statement:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/statements/file/write-to-text-file.sas||


  Using `file` creates a new file by default. In order to append to an existing file, the `mod` option must be used:
  `file 'p:\ath\to\file.txt' ~mod~`.
