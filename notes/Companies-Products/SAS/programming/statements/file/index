$ SAS statements: file
@ file

Within a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step[data step], the `file` statement specifies the file that is to be written to for the following
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/put[put] statements.

code {
FILE file-spec <options> <host-options>;
code }

*file-spec* identifies the destination. It is one of
  • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/fileref
  • A real physical operating system file and path (within quotes)
  • `log` to write the data to the → Companies-Products/SAS/log[log file]
  • `print` to write the data to the *SAS list*.


{ Change destination of put #change-put-dest

  By default, a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/put[put statement] writes
  into the → Companies-Products/SAS/log. The destination can be changed with
  the `file` statement:
  gh|about-SAS|/programming/statements/file/write-to-text-file.sas||


  Using `file` creates a new file by default. In order to append to an existing file, the `mod` option must be used:
  `file 'p:\ath\to\file.txt' ~mod~`.
