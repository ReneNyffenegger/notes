$ SAS data types
@ data types

SAS has only two data types: real numbers and fixed length character strings.
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/date[Dates and times] are internally stored as numbers.

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables/[Macro variables] are always characters.

Character values must be quoted to distinguish them from other language elements (such as
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables[variables]).

{ Conversion from one to another

  Values of one data type can be converted to the other with the
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/input and
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/put
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions[function].

}
{ Determining type

  The type of a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables[variable] can be determined
  with → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/vtype[`vtype`].

}

sa:
  → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-sets/change-datatypes[Change data types in a data set].

  In a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step[data step], the variables of a specific type can be referred to
  with the special → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables/list[variable lists] → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables/list/numeric-character-all[_numeric_ or _character_].
