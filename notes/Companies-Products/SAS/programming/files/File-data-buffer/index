$ SAS: File data buffer
@ file data buffer

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fopen[`fopen`] opens an external file and allocates a special buffer: the *file data buffer* (FDB)

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fread[`fread`] then reads a record from the external file and copies it into the FDB.

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fcol returns the current colun position in the FDB.

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fget[`fget`] assigns values from the FDB to → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-step[data step]
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables[variables].

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fsep[`fsep`] specifies the token delimiters for `fget`.

→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fwrite[`write`] writes the content of the FDB to the external file.

Finally, → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fclose[`fclose`] closes the external file.
