$ SAS: Determine columns in a data set

There are a few way to determine the columns (→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/variables) in a
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-sets[data set].

The relevant information is stored in the → Companies-Products/SAS/library/sashelp/views/vcolumn[sashelp.vcolumn] → Companies-Products/SAS/library/sashelp/views[view] and the
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/dictionary[dictionary] table
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/dictionary/columns[columns] (from which sashelp.vcolumn selects the data).

So, we can use → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/print[proc print] and
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/sql (
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/sql/select[select] and 
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/sql/describe-table[describe table] statements) to determine the columns of a data set:
