$ SAS: Program compilation - macro processor
@ macro processor

The macro processor stores text in two locations:
  • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-symbol-table[Macro table]
  • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-catalog[Macro catalog]

When a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros[macro] is compiled (`%macro m_foo; …. %mend m_foo;`), the macro processor stores
the corresponding text in the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-catalog.
-
When the macro later is executed, the macro processor fetches the text from the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-catalog.

When a value is assigned to a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/variables[macro variable] (`%let foo=42;`), the macro
processor stores the value in the macro symbol table.
-
When later the macro variable is resolved (`&foo`), the macro processor fetches the value from the macro symbol table.

Depending on the instructions of a macro, the macro processor pushes text onto the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/input-stack.

{ Compling a macro

  When the macro processor(?) compiles a macro, it does not resolve macro variables or execute macro calles within the compiled macro code.
