$ SAS: Program compilation - input stack
@ input stack

After submitting a piece of code for execution in a SAS environment, the code first goes to the *input stack*.

The → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/word-scanner then takes one character after another from the input stack and uses them
to build → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/tokens.
