$ SAS: Program compilation - word scanner
@ word scanner

The word scanner identifies (or builds) → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/tokens[tokens] during the
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation[compilation] process.

In order to build those tokens, the word scanner reads one character after another off the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/input-stack.

After having created one token, the token is either passed to the *word queue* or to the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-processor[multi component macro processor].
