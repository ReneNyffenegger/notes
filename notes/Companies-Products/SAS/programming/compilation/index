$ SAS: Program compilation
@ compilation

The *word scanner* passes → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/tokens[tokens] to the compiler until a step boundary is reached (`run`, `quit`, `proc` …).

These tokens are then checked for syntactically correctness and, if correct, compiled.

The compiled code is the further passed to the *execute module*.
