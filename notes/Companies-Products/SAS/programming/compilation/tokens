$ SAS: Program compilation - tokens
@ tokens

During the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation[compilation] process, tokens are recognized by the
→ Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/word-scanner.

The identified tokens are pushed to the *word queue*.


{ Different types of tokens

  There are different types of tokens:
    • Character tokens: `"double quoted strings"`, `'single quoted strings'`
    • Numeric tokens: 42, 42.03:e
    • Keywords: `proc`, `input`
    • Names: `var_foo`, `_n_`
    • Special tokens: Neither characters nor letters: `+`, `,`, `(` …

}
{ End of a token sas-end-of-token

  The word scanner recognizes the end of a token by a white space, the two macro triggers (`%`, `&`), by the dot (`.`) or by a special token (`+`, `;` …).

}
{ Macro triggers

  If the word scanner fetches a macro trigger (`%` or `&`), it does not push the next token to the word queue.
  -
  Rather, it invokes the (multi-component) → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/macro-processor to process them further.

  The macro processor might push text into the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/compilation/input-stack.
  -
  For example, if the condition of an → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/statements/if statement is met, the corresponding text is
  pushed back.
  -
  Similarly, a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/macros/statements/do statement might push text multiple times to the input stack.
