$ SAS programming, function put
@ put

The `put` function can be used to convert a value of → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[numeric data type] to a character data type: the
input to `put` can be either numeric or character, the output is always character. (Compare with → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/input[`input`]).

The → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/formats-informats[format] must be specified at compile time. If a dynamic format is needed at run time, → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/putn[`putn`] or `putc`
should be used.

  Note: there is also a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements[statement] with the
  name → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/put. This statement does not convert data types, it writes into
  the → Companies-Products/SAS/log.
