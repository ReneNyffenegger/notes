{ Return value

  For → Linux/shell/commands[shell commands], the return value of the `system` function can be used to determine if it executed successfully.
  - 
  If it ran successfully, the return value is 0. 

  In the following example, the system function executes → Linux/shell/commands/ls[`ls`] on a file. If the file does not exist, `ls` considers
  the command not successful and returns a value different from 0.

  If this is the case, the exmple uses `call system` to create (→ Linux/shell/commands/touch[`touch`]) the file.

  With another `system`, it then checks wheter the file was created indeed, this time checking for the return value being 0.
