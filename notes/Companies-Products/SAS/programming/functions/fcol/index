$ SAS programming, function fcol
@ fcol

`fcol` returns the starting position in the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/files/File-data-buffer where → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fput[`fput`] will write
the next chunk of data to. After using `fput`, this position advances. When → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fwrite[`fwrite`] is called, the
buffer is flushed to the output file (it was opened with `'o'`) and the position is reset to the start of the buffer (`1`).
