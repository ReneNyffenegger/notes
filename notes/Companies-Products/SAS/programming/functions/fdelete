$ SAS programming, function fdelete
@ fdelete

The following example uses → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/functions/fexist to check whether a file exists. If this is the case,
it deletes it using `fdelete`.

Note: `fdelete` and `fexist` operate on → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/fileref[filerefs], not on physical operating system path names.
Therefore, the macro also uses a → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/statements/filename statement to assign the filref.
