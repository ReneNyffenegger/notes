$ SAS: informats / formats
@ informats and formats

~Informats~ specify how data is converted from a character-string representation to the SAS-internal (possibly
numerical) value when it is read (hence the ~in~ in *informat).
-
Usually (always?), the informat is ended with a dot.

~Formats~ specify how values of variables are formated when they are printed.

Informats are defined with the `attrib` and `informat` statements, formats with `attrib` and `format` statements.


{ Formats

  The format, if applied to a variable, defines how the variable is displayed (without changing the value of the variable). The representation is always
  in the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[character data type].

  Formats can be created with → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/proc/format.
