$ SAS: Comparison of time formats hhmm, time and tod
@ time formats


The `hhmm.` format hours and minutes only. No seconds (but fractions of a minute). No leading zero.

The → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/formats-informats/time[`time`] format is able to additionally print seconds and fractions of seconds - also without leading zero.

The `tod` format is like the `time` format, yet it prints a leading zero if the hour is less than 10.
