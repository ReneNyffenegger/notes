$ SAS: missing values
@ missing values

Variables that were not explicitely assigned a value have a *missing value*.

Three types of missing values: 
 • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[numeric]
 • → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/data-types[character]
 • special numeric

 The representation of a missing numeric value is controlled by the → Companies-Products/SAS/programming/options/missing option.
 -
 Missing character values are represented by a single space (`' '`).

 { Special missing values
   
   `.a` through `.z` and `._` are special missing numeric values.

 }

{ Sort order of special missing numeric values
