$ IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator
@ IDAA

Aka: **IDAA**

IDAA is a hardware appliance, based on → Companies-Products/IBM/Netezza/.

IDAA targets analytical queries that are run on the operational data store (rather than a → development/Data/warehousing[DWH], see
→ development/Data/warehousing#datawarehouse-vs-datamart[issues with DWH]).
-
Yet, IDAA still loads a snapshot of the data (`ACCEL_LOAD_TABLES`).
