  The (so called) »smart« client has *rudimentary keyboard shortcuts* that are enabled by pressing and releasing the `alt` key.
  -
  `ctrl-r` allows to open another connection (re-connect).
  -
  `ctrl-shift-c` cancels the current operation.

  → Linux/fhs/var/opt/oracle/aaatab_conf

  Wildcards in GUI: `%`, `*`, `_`.

  AFP = Avaloq Front Platform

  ATRX (Heartbeat / Subscriber)

  Pillars: PBAL, PTOV, LBAL, LTOV

  PKP: Position keeping process

  The smart client allows (apparently depending on some configuration) to search for a specific `obj id` by prepending the obj id with a `#` and entering into the *Add search pane*.

  Running sessiones can be views in SQL*Plus with the `sessions2.sql` script.

  The table `SEC_DEPT` (optionally) defines → Companies-Products/Avaloq/users[users] that must give the ok for the *end of day* process. The end of day process won't start until all users listed
  have given their ok.

  OMS (Output Management System) is now called CCM Content Engine.
