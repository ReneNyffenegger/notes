Avaloq script is modelled after → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL but does not allow direct (→ development/databases/SQL[SQL]) access.

Used for
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/report-writer[Report writer]
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order/[Order] validation
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/AMI[Avaloq Message Interface]
  • Rule loader
  • Context actions

{ Packages

  Some available packages are
    • `util` (special characters, numbers, dates)
    • `format` (formatting numbers etc.)
    • `err` (formatting error messages)
    • `tab` (text based tables)

}
{ Vocabulary extensions

  Vocabulary extensions are additional keywords or syntax elements that are added to the basic script vocabulary depending on a
  script's *script type*.

  An example is `area` which is available for the *Report Writer Print Layout* script type.

}
{ Script context

  The script context is a predefined that refers to something depending on the context in which a script is run.

  For example, `doc` refers to the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order[order] that is verified in an
  order validation.

{ TODO

code {
session.debug(someText);

  Procedures, functions and constants of (predefined) Avaloq packages apparently can be overridden.
