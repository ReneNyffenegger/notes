Avaloq script is modelled after → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL but does not allow direct (→ development/databases/SQL[SQL]) access.

Used for
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/report-writer[Report writer]
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order/[Order] validation
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/AMI[Avaloq Message Interface]
  • Rule loader
  • Context actions

{ Packages

  Some available packages are
    • `util` (special characters, numbers, dates)
    • `format` (formatting numbers etc.)
    • `err` (formatting error messages)
    • `tab` (text based tables)

  In an Avaloq script package of → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/sources[source] type PGK (Avaloq script package), a
  → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] package can be imported with `import native`.

}
{ Vocabulary extensions

  Vocabulary extensions are additional keywords or syntax elements that are added to the basic script vocabulary depending on a
  script's *script type*.

  An example is `area` which is available for the *Report Writer Print Layout* script type.

}
{ Script context

  The script context is a predefined that refers to something depending on the context in which a script is run.

  For example, `doc` refers to the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order[order] that is verified in an
  order validation.

}
{ lists

  There is the concepts of lists in Avaloq scripts (for example a list of BPs etc.).

  Such lists are not a real data type. Thus, they cannot be saved or stored in a variable. Lists are returned by → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/DDIC[DDICs] and must be used within a `for … loop`.

  Apparently, there are two associated database → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables[tables] with lists: `list_number` and `list_char`.

  TODO: the → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] package `db_list#` and the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/DDIC[DDIC] `mem_db_list_nr` and `mem_db_list_char`.


}
{ TODO

code {
session.debug(someText);
code }

  Procedures, functions and constants of (predefined) Avaloq packages apparently can be overridden.

  The script package `cntprty_lib` synchronizes a BP's swift key with the linked counter party.
