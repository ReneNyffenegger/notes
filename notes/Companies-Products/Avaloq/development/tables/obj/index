$ Avaloq tables: obj

The `obj` table contains a record for each → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object[object] in an Avaloq environment.

In order to be able to query this table, → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/plsql-packages/session[`session#.open_session`] must be executed.

Historized translations of an object's name are stored in → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/obj/name[`obj_name`].


{ access_N_id

  Apparently, these columns store the required → Companies-Products/Avaloq/security#avq-access-code[access codes] to access an object in a denormalized form.
  
  The normalized table seems to be → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/sec/obj/access[`sec_obj_access`].


}
{ obj_pos

  Contrary to intuition, there is no *obj_pos* table.

  It seems that the column `instru_id` of the `obj` table indicates that the respective record is actually a position (and should have gone into the non existing `obj_pos` table).

  If the record refers to a *position*, then the column `obj_owner_id` apparently stores the id of the container that the position belongs to.
