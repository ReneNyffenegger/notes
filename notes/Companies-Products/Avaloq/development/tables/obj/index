{ obj

  If the record refers to a *position*, then the column `obj_owner_id` apparently stores the id of the container that the position belongs to.

}
{ obj_pos

  Contrary to intuition, there is no *obj_pos* table.

  It seems that the column `instru_id` of the `obj` table indicates that the respective record is actually a position (and should have gone into the non existing `obj_pos` table).
