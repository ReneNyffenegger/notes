  It is also used to join tables with a `order_by_form` column (such as → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/code/obj/classif[`code_obj_classif`].

  ? Apparently, → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/plsql-packages/param_gen[`param_gen#`] can also be used to insert records into this table.
