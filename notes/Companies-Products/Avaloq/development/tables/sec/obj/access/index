$ Avaloq table: sec_obj_access

Stores the required → Companies-Products/Avaloq/security#avq-access-code[access codes] for → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object[objects].

It seems that the same access codes are denormalized into the columns `access_N_id` in the table → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/obj[`obj]`.
