$ Avaloq development: context actions

Context actions are used to trigger a *workflow action* (WFC), execute
a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/tasks[task] or call an (Avaloq) script package.

Context actions use a *rule based* implementation approach. The configuration takes
place in the following → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables[tables]:
  • ctx_action
  • ctx_action_rule_ld
  • wfc_action
  • out_text_norm

Apparently, context actions are abbreviated with `CTX`.
