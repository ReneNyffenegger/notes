$ Avaloq: report writer

With *report writer*, it's possible to create reports for paper and screen.

{ Report definition

  A report definition consists of a
    • Hierarchical datamart definition (aka report datamart)
    • Layout definition

}
{ Hierarchical datamart definition


}
{ Layout definitions

  The layout definition specifies how the retrieved data will be displayed

  A layout definition is a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/sources[source] of one of the following types:
    • REP SCREE
    • REP PRINT (produces → development/languages/PostScript)
    • REP FILE
    • REP SCRIPT (which creates an executable → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/Avaloq-script[script]).
    • REP TABLE (usually to create a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/pillars[pillar]).

}
{ Example script

code {
[Report 2.0]

report task_pos_list.pos  

naming dfltlang 'Position list by name'

print layout
      format A4
      orientation landscape
      border left 20 top 20 bottom 20 right 20
      font 'Arial' 9
      …

      on column head
         …

      on report head
         font 'Arial-Bold' 9

      if top.seq_nr is null then -- No data found
         column left session.text('LABEL.NO_DATA_FOUND');
      else
         column left rep_lib.title(task_exec);
      end if;

      linefeed
      pagepbreak

end layout
end report
code }

}

{ TODO

  To create a report with report writer, apparently a datamart → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/DDIC[DDIC] is needed.
