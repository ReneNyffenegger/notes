{ Workflow actions

  Workflow actions are performed by → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order[orders].

  Some workflow actions are:
    • new
    • Discard
    • Verify & Do
    • Store

  Except for *generic workflow actions* (such as *copy*), the available workflow actions are dependend on an → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order[order's] *workflow status*. 
  -
  Usually, executing a workflow action changes the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order[order's] *workflow status*.

  In order to execute a workflow action, a user needs to have the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/security#avq-access-code[access code] with which the workflow action
  is secured.

  When a workflow action is performed, Avaloq executes a sequence of (possibly one) *workflow commands* (which in earlier Avaloq releases were referred to as *micro commands*).

  → Companies-Products/Avaloq/users[Users] who can execute workflow actions are chargeable.

  { store

    The workflow action *store* brings an → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order[order] from the mem doc layer to the doc layer.

  }
