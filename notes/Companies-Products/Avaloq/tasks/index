$ Avaloq tasks

Apparently, there are five taks types:
  • message
  • order book
  • program
  • report
  • others

Execution of tasks either
  • Synchronously: in the session of an Avaloq user (session is blocked until task has finished) or
  • Asynchronously: task is submitted to a *process queue* and then executed in the session of a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP[background process]. The status of such tasks can be checked in *central services -> tasks*, or
  • By a job: the task is regularly executed.

A task (as also a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP/PRCQ[process queues]) needs a (running) → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP[BGP] to do its work.

A task is started in the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/SmartClient[SmartClient], through a job or in → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/Avaloq-script[Avaloq script] (with the `task_exec` → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/DDIC.

{ Task definition

    • an (executable) procedure and
    • its parameters.

}
{ Task template
