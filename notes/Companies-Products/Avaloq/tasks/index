$ Avaloq tasks

A task is a PL/SQL program that is supplied by Avaloq. It cannot be changed through customization.

Apparently, there are five taks types:
  • message
  • order book
  • program
  • report
  • others

Execution of tasks either
  • Synchronously: in the session of an Avaloq user (session is blocked until task has finished) or
  • Asynchronously: task is submitted to a *process queue* and then executed in the session of a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP[background process]. The status of such tasks can be checked in *central services -> tasks*, or
  • By a job: the task is regularly executed.

A task (as also a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP/PRCQ[process queues]) needs a (running) → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP[BGP] to do its work.

A task is started in the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/SmartClient[SmartClient], through a job or in → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/Avaloq-script[Avaloq script] (with the `task_exec` → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/DDIC).

Third party systems might use the PL/SQL package → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/plsql-packages/task_exec_intf.

Some tasks are → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/report-writer[report writer] enabled. These reference a flat datamart that is supplied by Avaloq.

{ Task definition

  A *task definition* describes some basic information about the task and consists of
    • an (executable) procedure and
    • its parameters.

  The available tasks are stored in `obj_task_def`.

  Each task has a set of parameters (or arguments). These are described in the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables#avq-tab-obj_tasks_def_par[obj_tasks_def_par] table.

}
{ Task template

  A *task template* is a *task definition* whose parameters are set to predefined values. Thus, there is a 1:n relationship between task definitions and task templates.

? The `obj_task_templ_v` view describes task templates.
