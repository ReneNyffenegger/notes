$ Avaloq tasks

Apparently, there are five taks types:
  • message
  • order book
  • program
  • report
  • others

Execution of tasks either
  • Synchronously: in the session of an Avaloq user (session is blocked until task has finished) or
  • Asynchronously: task is submitted to a *process queue* and then executed in the session of a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP[background process]. The status of such tasks can be checked in *central services -> tasks*, or
  • By a job: the task is regularly executed.

A *task definition* consists of
  • an (executable) procedure and
  • its parameters.

A *task template* is a *task definition* whose parameters are set to predefined values.
