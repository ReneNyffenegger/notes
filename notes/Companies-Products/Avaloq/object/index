The Avaloq system revolves around so called objects which store the data.

An → Companies-Products/Avaloq/order is needed to change an object.

{ Types #avq-obj-type

  There are different types of objects: BPs, Persons, Addresses, etc.

  The possible types are stored in → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables#avq-tab-code_obj_type.

{ Attributes

  • Classifications and their classes
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object/attributes/key[keys]
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object/attributes/addition[additions]
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object/attributes/remark[remarks]
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object/attributes/relation[relations] (to logically link objects)
  • collections (?), to store sets of objects.

}
{ Collections

  A collection allows to store a set of objects. There are two types of collections:
    • dynamic and
    • static collections.

  The objects in a *static collection* must be maintained manually: An object put in the collection stays
  in the colletion until it is taken out again.

  A *dynamic collection* consists of a set of criterions. When the collection is needed, all objects are evaluated if the fit the criterions and if so, they belong the collection.

}
{ Searching for objects

  Objects can be searched with a lookup → Companies-Products/Avaloq/forms[form].
