A *person* is a *real world* natural or legal person.

A *business partner* (commonly abbreviated by BP) represents an account and/or customer contract.
-
Unlike a person, a BP can perform actions in Avaloq.

A *container* (CONT) is a basket to put assets into.

A *position* is an asset or money account within a container. It keeps track of the quantity owned of that asset.

Persons can be related to other persons and BPs.

A `Docm` apparently might be contract such as an *e-Banking Contract*.
