$ Avaloq: object classification

A classification is associated with exactly one → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object#avq-obj-type[object type].

Classes are customized with *code tab* sources.

{ System and customer classifications and classes

  Some classificatoins are maintained by Avaloq. These are called *system classifications* and used in the kernel of Avaloq core.

  Customers might add their *customer classifications* on top of the system classifications.

  In a similar spirit, the classes that belong to a classification are also distinguished between system and customor classes.
