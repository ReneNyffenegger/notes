$ Avaloq: object additions
-

Additions are used to store informational data for the Avaloq end user only. The avaloq system does not use this information.
Consequently, the information cannot be searched for (in the so called »smart« client, that is). However, it is possible
to search for it with → development/databases/SQL[SQL] if one is granted select right on relevant tables.
-
If there is a requirement to be able to search for information, → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object/attributes/key[keys] should be instead.

sa:

  → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object[objects]

  → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object/attributes[Object attributes]

  → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/code/obj/index#avq-tab-code_obj_add.
