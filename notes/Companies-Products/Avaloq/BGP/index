@ BGP

BGPs are needed by → Companies-Products/Avaloq/tasks[tasks] and *process queues* for
  • Job scheduling
  • Printing
  • Handling process queues
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/tasks[tasks] that are executed asynchronously.
  • → Companies-Products/Avaloq/AMI/EMI
  • etc.


Available BGPs can be found and started in *central services*.

Background processes run as a *technical* → Companies-Products/Avaloq/users[user] (who execute → development/databases/SQL[SQL] and
→ development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] under the Oracle user to the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/oracle-schemas/index#avq-k[K].

{ Types of BGPs

  There are two types of BGPs:
    • BGP_ORA: → development/databases/Oracle/PL-SQL[PL/SQL] packages that are executed by the → development/databases/Oracle[Oracle] database.
    • BGP_OS: → Linux/shell/bash/scripts/[shell scripts], → development/languages/C-C-plus-plus/C/[C] or → development/languages/Java[Java] programs etc.

{ BGP 911: Task Dispatcher

  Executs asynchronously executed → Companies-Products/Avaloq/tasks[tasks].

}
{ BGP 973: Load market data via DDE

  The interface between Avaloq and a Retuers PC.

}
{ BGP 990/991

  Fills the → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables#atrx_baseline_subscr table.

}
{ Starting / stopping

  Background processess can be started and stopeed in the *central services → Companies-Products/Avaloq/desk[desk]*.

  Alternatively, they can be started and stopped with the `bgp_start.sql` and `bgp_stop.sql` scripts (in SQL*Plus).

}
{ Process queue BGPs

  A *process queue BGP* »handles« 1 or more → Companies-Products/Avaloq/BGP/PRCQ[process queues].

  A PRCQ-BGP constantly checks the `prcq` table if it contains records whosde status is *Ready (first)* or *Ready (retry)*.

}
{ Misc

  Apparently, all BGPs run as → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/oracle-schemas#avq-i[Oracle user I].
