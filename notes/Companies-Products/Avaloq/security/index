{ Oracle role level security (RLS)

  Most → Companies-Products/Avaloq/object[objects] are protected with Oracle RLS: when → development/databases/SQL/select[selecting] from the
  → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/obj[obj] table, RLS allows to select a row from obj when when one of its column values
  `access_svr_id` or `access_1_id` through `access_8_id` is present in `code_sec_user_access_cache` with `sec_user_id = sys_context('AAA_SEC', 'SEC_USER_ID')`

  RLS can be turned off by setting `is_rls_sec` off in → Companies-Products/Avaloq/development/tables/code/obj/type

}
{ Access codes

  Access codes can be assigned or removed from a → Companies-Products/Avaloq/users[user] with the `user_admin_intf#` package.
