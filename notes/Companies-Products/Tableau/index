    TSM is the *Tableau Services Manager*. It configures the Tableau Server.

    The port number to connect to TSM administrator console is 8850 (`https://localhost:8850/`).

    *Gateway Port*: by default, the Tableau Server listens for requests on port 80 (which can be changed when configuring the server).


  }
  { Site

    A *site* is a collection of users, groups and content (which in turn consists of workbooks and data sources).

    The idea behind a site is that a team can share data sources and workbooks with each other.

    A site has an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL].

  }
  { Command line tools
