  The main components of the *Tableau Server* are
    • Application Server (→ development/security/authentication[authentication] and authorization).
    • VizQL Server (Converts queries from *data source* into visualization)
    • Data Server (Manages metadata and stores data from external data sources)

  The *repository* (aka → https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/data_dictionary.htm[data dictionary]?) is stored in the *workgroup* database of a PostgrSQL installation.

}

  Apparently, these query results are referred to as *views*?

{ Misc


  { TSM

    TSM is the *Tableau Services Manager*. It configures the Tableau Server.

    The port number to connect to TSM administrator console is 8850 (`https://localhost:8850/`).

    *Gateway Port*: by default, the Tableau Server listens for requests on port 80 (which can be changed when configuring the server).


  }
  { Site

    A *site* is a collection of users, groups and content (which in turn consists of workbooks and data sources).

    The idea behind a site is that a team can share data sources and workbooks with each other.

    A site has an → development/web/URI-URL-URN-IRI-URC#url[URL].

  }
  { Command line tools

  `tabadmin` to administer *Tableau Server configuration settings*.
   -
   Apparently, `tabadmin` is now replaced with `tsm`.

  `tabcmd` to automate common tasks such as publishing workbooks in batches and administering uesrs and groups.

  }
