<h1>NFS - Network File System</h1>
<div class='t'>
The most ubiquitous <i>distributed</i> file system - one of the oldest still in use. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
An <i>NFS Server</i> lets a porition of its local file system be accessed by other nodes. These nodes (the <i>clients</i>) mount that portion. </div>
<div class='h'><h2>Advantage</h2>
<div class='t'>
The <i>advantage</i> for the client is that he does not be aware of his using NFS, he can use  <code>open</code>,  <code>close</code> etc as he does with his local files. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2 id='limitations'>Limitations</h2>
<div class='t'>
  There are at least four limitations with NFS: </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  1) The total size of the files of an NFS mount is limited to storage capabilities of the server. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  2) No high availability - What happens, if the server goes down? </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  3) If there are many clients, there might be performance bottlenecks when they simultaneously try to   read from or write to the server. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  4) Finally, the client need to transfer the data to their local machine </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/Apache/Hadoop/HDFS/index.html'>HDFS</a> tries to solve these limitations. </div>
