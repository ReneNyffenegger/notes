<div class='h'><h2>alternate object database</h2>
<div class='t'>
  Via the alternates mechansism, a repository can inherit part of its object database from another object databse, which is called an «alternate» </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>chain</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A list of objects, where each object in the list contains a reference to its successor (for example, the successor of a commit could be one of its parents). </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>checkout</h2>
<div class='t'>
  The action of updating all or part of the <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree.html'>working tree</a> with a   <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tree.html'>tree object</a> or <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/blob.html'>blob</a> from the   <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database.html'>object database</a>, and updating the index and HEAD if the whole   working tree has been pointed at a new branch. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>cherry picking</h2>
<div class='t'>
  Extract the change introduced by an existing commit and to record it based on the <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/branch.html#tip-of-the-branch'>tip of the current branch</a> as   new commit. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>commit-ish / commitish</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit.html'>commit object</a> or <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/index.html'>object</a> that can be   recursively dereferenced to a commit object. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  The following are all commit-ishes: commit object, <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tag.html'>tab object</a> that points to a commit object,   a tag object that points to a tag object that points to a commit object etc. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2 id='core-git'>core Git</h2>
<div class='t'>
  Fundamental data structures and utilities of Git. Exposes only limited source code management tools. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  See also: <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/commands/index.html'>git commands</a> </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>dangling object</h2>
<div class='t'>
  An unreachable <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/index.html'>object</a> which is not reachable even from other unreachable objects. A dangling object has no   reference to it from any reference or object in the repository. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>evil merge</h2>
<div class='t'>
  An evil merge is a merge that introduces changes that do not appear in any parent. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>fast-forward</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have a revision and you are merging another <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/branch.html'>branch's</a> changes that happen to   be  a descendant of hat you hae. In such cases, you do not make a new merge commit but instead just jupdate to this revision. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  This will happen frequently on a remote-tracking branch of a remote <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/repository.html'>repository</a>. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>pickaxe</h2>
<div class='t'>
  The term pickaxe refers to an option to the diffcore routines that help select changes that add or delete a given text string. With the  <code>--pickaxe-all</code> option, it can   be used to view the full changeset that introduced or removed, say, a particular line of text. (see  <code>git diff</code>). </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>per-worktree ref</h2>
<div class='t'>
  Refs that are per-worktree, rather than global. This is presently only HEAD and any refs that start with  <code>refs/bisect</code>, but ight later include other unusual refs. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>pseudoref</h2>
<div class='t'>
  Pseudorefs are a class of files under <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/_git/index.html'>.git</a> which behave like refs for the purpose of rev-parse, but which are treated specially by git.   Pseudorefs both have names that are all-caps, and always start with a line consisting of a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/security/SHA-1.html'>SHA 1 - Secure Hash Algorithm 1</a> followed by whitespace. So,   <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD.html'>HEAD</a> is not a pseudoref, because it is sometimes a symbolic ref. They might optionally contain   some additional daa. MERGE_HEAD and CHERRY_PICK_HEAD are examples. Unlike per-worktree refs, these files cannot be symbolic refs, and never have reflogs. They also   cannot be updated through the normal ref update machinery. Instead, they are updated by directly writing to the files. However, they can be read as if they were refs, so  <code>git rev-parse MERGE_HEAD</code> will   work. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>rebase</h2>
<div class='t'>
  To replay a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit.html'>commits</a> from a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/branch.html'>branch</a>   to a different base, and reset the head of that branch to the result. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>refspec</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A refspec is used by <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/branch.html#fetch'>fetch</a> and <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/push.html'>push</a> to describe   the mapping between remote ref and local ref. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>rewind</h2>
<div class='t'>
  To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the head to an earlier revision.  </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>submodule</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A repository that holds the history of a separate project inside another repository (the latter of which called superproject) </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>superproject</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A repository that references repositories of other projects in its working tree as submodules. The superproject knows about the   names of (but does not hold copies of) commit objecs of the contained submodules. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>tag</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A tag is a special <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/ref.html'>ref</a> used as to mark a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit.html'>commit</a> in the history. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  A ref under  <code>refs/tag/</code> namespace that points to an object of an arbitrary type (typically a tag points to either a tag or a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit.html'>commit object</a>). </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  In contrast to a head, a tag is not updated by the  <code>commit</code> command. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  A tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the commit ancestry chain. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>tree</h2>
<div class='t'>
   Either a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree.html'>working tree [git]</a> or a <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/tree.html'>tree object</a> together with    the dependent blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working tree). </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>unmerged index</h2>
<div class='t'>
  An index which contains unmerged index entries. </div>
