<h1>branch [git]</h1>
<div class='t'>
A <i>branch</i> is an <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/index.html'>object</a> with two children. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
A <i>branch</i> is an active line of development: Git commands operate on the «current branch». </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
A <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/repository.html'>repository</a> can track an arbitrary number of branches. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
A <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/working-tree.html'>working tree</a> is associated with exactly one of these branches: the <i>current branch</i>. </div>
<div class='h'><h2 id='current'>Current branch</h2>
<div class='t'>
  See also: <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/HEAD.html'>HEAD</a>. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2 id='master'>master</h2>
<div class='t'>
  The default development branch, created along with a new <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/repository.html'>repository</a>. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2 id='fetch'>fetching a branch</h2>
<div class='t'>
  <i>Fetching a branch</i> means to get the branch's head ref from a remote <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/repository.html'>repository</a> to find   out which objects are missing from the local <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/database.html'>object database</a>, and to get them, too. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
   <code>man git-fetch</code>. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2 id='tip-of-the-branch'>Tip of the branch</h2>
<div class='t'>
  The most recent <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/commit.html'>commit</a> on a brnch is referred to as the <i>tip of that branch</i>. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  The tip of the branch is referenced by a <i>branch head</i>. This branch head moves forward as further commits are made in that branch. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  TODO: When <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/merge.html'>merging</a>, the tips of two branches are   unified in a new <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/objects/index.html'>commid in a new → development/version-control-systems/git/objects[commit</a>. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>head</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A named reference to the commit at the tip of a branch, stored in the <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//development/version-control-systems/git/_git/refs/heads/index.html'>.git/refs/heads</a> directory (except when using packed refs). </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  A synonym for head is <i>head ref</i>. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>index</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are stored as objects. The index is a stored version of your working tree. Truth be told, it can   also contain a second, a even a third version of a working tree, whichare used when merging. </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>index entry</h2>
<div class='t'>
  The information regarding a particualr file, stored in the index. An intex entry can be unmerged, if a merge was started but not finished (i.e. if the index contains multiple   versions of that file). </div>
</div>
<div class='h'><h2>topic branch</h2>
<div class='t'>
  A branch that is used by a developer to identifiy a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have   several small branches that each contain very well defined concepts or smallincremental yet related changes. </div><div class='g'></div><div class='t'>
  To fint the tip of a topic branch, run  <code>git log --first-parent master..pu</code> and look for the merge commit. The second parent of this commit is the   tip of the topic branch. </div>
