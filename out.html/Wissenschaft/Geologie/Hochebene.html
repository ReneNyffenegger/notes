Hochebene: relativ flache, ausgedehnte Region, die (ohne Knicke oder Beulen) gegenüber der Umgebung um mindestens 150 Meter hochgehoben wurde. </div>
<div class='t'>
Eine Hochebene enthält annähern horizontale Gesteinsschichten. Dieselbe Abfolge von Gesteinsschichten findet sich auch um die Hochebene herum, aber eben höhenmässig versetzt. </div>

<blockquote>  The problem of the uplift of large plateau areas is one which has puzzled students of the  Earth's crust for a very long time. <b>what mechanism</b> would cause a large volumen of low standing continents to rise rapidly a mile in the air?  Furthermore, evidence from gravity surveys suggests that the rocks underlying the Colorado plateau are in isostatic balance, that is,  this large area is <b>floating at its correct elevation</b> in view of its mass and density. Recent <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//Wissenschaft/Geologie/Erdbeben.html'>seismic</a> evidence confirms this, in that  the depth to the [<a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//Wissenschaft/Geologie/Moho.html'>Moho</a>] discontinuity under the Colorado plateau is approximately 10 kilometers greater  than over most of continental North America. Thus, appropriate roots of light rock extend into the dense substratum to account for the  higher elevation of the Colorado plateau. We have then a double-ended mystery, for the Colorado plateau seems to have grown downward at  the same time that its emerged part rose upward. This is just as startling as it would be to see a floating cork suddenly rise and float a  half inch higher in a pan of water. To date, the only hypothesis to explain the upward motion of large regions like the Colorado plateau  is that of convection currents. Slowly moving convection currents in the solid rock, some 40 to 50 kilometers [25 to 30 miles] below the  surface of the Earth, are presumed to have swept a great volume of light rock from some unidentified place and to have deposited it  underneath the Colorado plateau. A total volume of approximately 2,500,000 cubic miles of sialic rock is necessary to account for the  uplift of the Colorado plateau. While it is not hard to visualize rocks as having no great strength at the high pressures and temperatures  existing at depths of 40 to 50 kilometers, it is quite another matter to visualize currents in solid rock of sufficient magnitude to bring  in and deposit this quantity of light material in a relatively uniform layer underneath the entire Colorado plateau region.<br>  The <a href='file:///home/rene/github/github/notes/out.html//Wissenschaft/Geologie/tibetisches-Plateau.html'>Tibetan plateaus</a> present a similar problem, but on a vastly larger scale.  There, an area of 750,000 square miles has been uplifted from approximately  sea level to a mean elevation of roughly three miles, and the Himalayan  mountain chain bordering this region has floated upward some five miles, and  rather late in geologic time, probably within the last 20,000,000 years. The  quantity of light rock which would need to be swept underneath these plateaus  by convection currents to produce the effects noted would be an order of  magnitude greater than that needed to uplift the Colorado plateau, that is,  approximately 25,000,000 cubic miles. Even more troublesome than the method  of transporting all this light rock at shallow depths below the surface of  the Earth is the problem of its source. The region from which the light rock  was moved should have experienced spectacular subsidence, but no giant  neighboring depressions are known. A lesser but large problem is how such  enormous quantities of light rock can be dispersed so uniformly over so large  an area. <footer><cite>George C.
